At the time, Amazon did not heavily enforce masks and social distancing, Sentoso said.\\n\\nSentoso, a rising fourth-year cognitive science student, reached out to Kent Wong, the director of the UCLA Labor Center, after his father passed away for guidance on how to prevent workers from facing a similar situation. Sentoso took a labor studies course with Wong in the fall.\\n\\nWong said he was moved when he first heard Sentosos request.\\n\\nIt really touched me, Wong said. Even in this very tragic family situation, he was looking beyond and seeing that there was something wrong here and that he needs to do something to make sure that other people will not suffer a similar fate.\\n\\nWong also gave Sentoso a labor studies perspective on his fathers experience with Amazon.\\n\\nThe fact that we have one of our own students suffer as a consequence of the callous disregard for worker safety at the hands of this massive corporation ... is something that needs awareness, Wong said.\\n\\nWong said Harry Sentoso did everything right in the traditional sense: he immigrated from Indonesia to the United States, got a masters degree and raised two sons. Yet, he passed away from COVID-19 a few weeks after getting the job at Amazon to support his family, Wong said.\\n\\n[caption id=\"attachment_386018\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-386018 size-full\" src=\"https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/picb.web_.news_.evansfather.courtesy-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1050\"> Sentoso hopes to continue sharing his father\\'s story to advocate for labor rights. (Courtesy of Evan Sentoso)[/caption]\\n\\nWong said he offered Sentoso an internship at the UCLA Labor Center to further his labor rights activism. The Labor Center offers internships to students who are passionate about worker justice issues, and Wong saw Sentoso as an ideal candidate, Wong said.\\n\\nWanting to protect other workers from his fathers experience, Sentoso said he shared his fathers experience with the Los Angeles Times and KTLA hoping to raise awareness about the lack of protection some workers face.\\n\\nSharing my story and listening to other people battle with COVID-19 is a way to be in this fight together, Sentoso said.\\n\\nSentoso plans to continue to share his fathers story, learn how to raise awareness for labor rights and research how to unionize workers to institute change for labor rights through his internship.\\n\\nOffering my voice and sharing my dad\\'s story I think can potentially be powerful,\" Sentoso said. Especially in a time of emergency, where people\\'s lives are at stake.\\n\\nBut Sentoso is still grieving.\\n\\nImmediately after his father passed, Sentoso said he and his brother cared for their mother Endang Sentoso, who contracted COVID-19 soon after her husband. The two monitored her condition and practiced strict hygiene, such as disinfecting various surfaces in their house and washing their hands to aid her recovery. They also practiced social distancing and wore masks, creating an impossible nature to grieve, Sentoso said.\\n\\nGrieving immediately after my dads passing was almost non-existent, he said.\\n\\nSentoso said he and his brother tried to take the loss of his father day by day, but felt trapped in a world of perpetual darkness and isolation.\\n\\nSentoso takes walks around his neighborhood, but seeing places he and his father used to frequent  like the neighborhood park or his high school  sometimes causes him to break down, he said.\\n\\nOnce, when Sentoso and his mother waited in line at 99 Ranch Market, an Asian grocery store, they bursted into tears. The market housed memories of the family going on grocery trips growing up, Sentoso said.\\n\\nYou don\\'t expect to have these breakdowns, you just kind of do, he said. It\\'s not something you can control.\\n\\nHis mother has since recovered and Sentoso has found ways to cope with his fathers passing.\\n\\nSince most of his extended family is in Indonesia and because of the need for social distancing, Sentoso did not have much in-person support from his family and friends, but it would have helped tremendously, he said.\\n\\nTalking about his fathers life over video calls isnt the same, Sentoso said.\\n\\nSome of Sentosos family and friends found ways around social distancing regulations to support him.\\n\\nA few of Sentosos high school and college friends surprised him with care packages and food. He once received face masks from a friend in Maryland. Sentosos cousin, who lives 20 minutes away from him, regularly visited Sentosos house to make sure Sentoso and his family were well-fed.\\n\\nJoshua Lee, a rising fourth-year economics student and one of Sentosos closest friends, said he and his parents frequently dropped off meals at Sentosos house to help support.\\n\\nLee would also talk to Sentoso when dropping food off. He remembers talking with Sentoso once for an hour. Talking to his friend in person about non-COVID related topics, like the next school year or apartment life, was nice, Lee said.\\n\\nSentoso is grateful for his friends and family who reached out to him.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t have asked for such a supportive  and caring group of friends, Sentoso said.\\n\\nSentoso said he hopes that by sharing his fathers story, he can raise awareness on how corporate America should better protect its workers\\' wellbeing.\\n\\nSentoso said he is sure that his father would have wanted him to move forward.\\n\\nMy dad definitely would have wanted me, my brother and my entire family to ... keep fighting even in the most difficult of times, Sentoso said. I am determined to continue and follow my dad\\'s footsteps and hopefully make the world a better place.', '<p>In the middle of a pandemic, with protests against racial injustice sparking up around the country, all Dorian Thompson-Robinson could do was <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://twitter.com/DoriansTweets/status/1267979287908384768\">tweet</a>.<br /></p><p>He wanted to do more, but because of NCAA bylaws, the rising junior UCLA football quarterback\\'s hands were tied.</p><p>The NCAA website states \"Division I student-athletes may not promote or endorse a commercial product or service, even if they are not paid to participate in the activity\" &#8211; which typically includes fundraisers.

After several days of confusion and miscommunication, the Tigers\\' compliance office sorted everything out and Lawerence was allowed to resume raising money, but the uncertainty and complicated rules had already made their mark.<br /></p><p><b>[Related: </b><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/04/29/ncaa-expresses-support-for-student-athlete-name-image-and-likeness-compensation\"><b>NCAA expresses support for student-athlete name, image and likeness compensation</b></a><b>]</b></p><p>Thompson-Robinson decided to pursue a potential fundraiser anyway, and one week after expressing frustration at the NCAA, the governing body <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://twitter.com/DoriansTweets/status/1270530730607575040\">approved his pitch</a>.

Because of remote instruction during spring quarter, Thompson-Robinson said he didn\\'t run the fundraiser by his coaches like he usually would have, instead having his mom and other mentors at home vet the idea before going to the compliance office.</p><p>The compliance office was integral in making sure the fundraiser was NCAA-approved and followed its guidelines down to every last detail. But if a non-student-athlete wanted to sell hoodies for the Black Lives Matter movement, they wouldn\\'t need any school oversight.</p><p>\"I wish I didn\\'t have to go through (the compliance office), I wish I could just do this stuff,\" Thompson-Robinson said. \"But they make it a lot easier on us as athletes if we want to advocate for ourselves in this type of matter. I definitely think our compliance people over at UCLA does a great job with that stuff.\"<br /></p><p>While things were still being straightened out between UCLA and the NCAA, Thompson-Robinson said he researched several foundations and organizations to find which one was best for him to donate to. Thompson-Robinson hadn\\'t had any previous hands-on volunteer experience within the Black Lives Matter movement, but he still had a few ideas in mind when making his shortlist.</p><p>\"I wanted to do one that wasn\\'t being talked about as much, but still has a big part in the community,\" Thompson-Robinson said. \"The 100 Black Men here in Vegas does a lot for our community and the Black youth here, mentoring them.

Thompson-Robinson was also the first to stand up for Chip Kelly when some media outlets implied the letter was a slight against the UCLA coach.</p><p><b>[Related: </b><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/06/19/ucla-football-players-demand-better-protections-in-return-to-training-amid-pandemic\"><b>UCLA football players demand better protections in return to training amid pandemic</b></a><b>]</b></p><p>While Thompson-Robinson wouldn\\'t say if he saw himself as more of a leader heading into the 2020 season, he did say he has experienced tremendous personal growth over the past few months.</p><p>\"It\\'s just me growing up as a person, as a quarterback &#8211; whatever you want to call me,\" Thompson-Robinson said. \"I\\'m just growing up and maturing as things hit me, as I experience new things.\"</p>', '<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of Californias largest labor union organized a statewide protest Wednesday against UC-wide layoffs related to the coronavirus pandemic.</span>\\n\\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC, UC, youre no good, treat your workers like you should, chanted dozens of unionized employees outside the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Wednesday.</span>\\n\\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike at UCLA involved union members from American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299 and Teamsters Local 2010.

      "  '<p>The internet is forever, but students\\' futures shouldn&#8217;t be dictated by their pasts.</p><p> In January, Kaplan Test Prep reported 36% of college admissions officers <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/02/02/survey-finds-36-of-college-admissions-officers-look-at-students-social-media/\">view</a> applicants&#8217; social media profiles, an 11% bump from last year.</p><p>As if it wasn\\'t hard enough for applicants to get into college before universities added cyberstalking to the admissions process. </p><p>UCLA is the most-applied-to university in the country, with more than 135,000 applicants in 2019. But in fall 2019, UCLA  had an admission rate of approximately 14%. And last year, the university <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2019/05/30/ucla-proposes-lower-enrollment-rates-to-reduce-overcrowding-promote-graduation-rates/\">planned</a> to cap enrollment rates in order to fix overcrowding.</p><p>And UCLA Undergraduate Admission doesn\\'t look at social media, so many qualified students are already being turned away without the use of social media in admission. </p><p>Using social media accounts to assess a borderline student&#8217;s compatibility with a university is not only time-consuming, entirely subjective and not indicative of potential collegiate success, but also reflects an affinity for &#8220;cancel culture&#8221;<b> </b>that an influential university like UCLA should not support.</p><p>When evaluating a student&#8217;s application, colleges need to determine if a student and a university are a good fit for one another. </p><p>Gary Clark, director of UCLA Undergraduate Admission, said in an emailed statement that gauging a student&#8217;s potential success on campus is paramount to the admissions process.</p><p>&#8220;Our goal is to determine if we feel the student is a good fit for UCLA, meaning is the student able to both benefit from and contribute to UCLA in and outside of the classroom,&#8221; Clark said in the statement. </p><p>The university does not look at social media profiles to assess students\\' applications and instead strictly adheres to the 14 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/freshman/comprehensive-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">criteria</a> stipulated by the University of California, according to an emailed statement from UCLA Undergraduate Admission.</p><p>And while this method of admissions hasn\\'t been adopted yet, an increasingly digital world makes it difficult to know what policy the university will implement in the future.</p><p>It&#8217;s hard to determine a student&#8217;s ability to succeed from their social media profiles, as these profiles are often used to push a public persona rather than to reflect real life. A 2019 poll conducted by YouGov <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/technology/articles-reports/2019/10/31/social-media-content-often-unreliable-say-users\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found</a> that 41% of social media users in Britain claimed to have seen inaccurate content during a 30-day period.</p><p>As such, reviewing profiles would quickly become a waste of time for admissions departments. </p><p>&#8220;People use social media to reflect the recreation they engage in,&#8221; said Jason Mally, a fifth-year cognitive science and computer science student. &#8220;Besides LinkedIn, social media sites are not professional resumes.&#8221;</p><p>The content presented on each platform is different &#8211; not every post on Twitter is reflective of someone&#8217;s professional persona, nor is it indicative of their potential success as a student. </p><p>Inappropriate or even downright offensive posts are most likely what admissions officers are looking for.</p><p>But it&#8217;s hard to tell what admissions officers would consider when assessing social media accounts, and arbitrary decisions could set dangerous precedents. One positive social media post could propel an applicant over the edge, while one negative post could irreparably change their future.<br /></p><p>Applying for college is a stressful time, and any fair advantage a student can get in the process, they will take.</p><p>&#8220;I had friends in high school who thought universities might check their social media, so they went through and deleted whatever they thought put their chances at risk,&#8221; Mally said.</p><p>While this may just be pictures of partying or skipping class, it could also include purging social media of any controversial subject matter, like posts about political or other personal beliefs. Admissions directors are still people who have biases, so there&#8217;s no reason to risk potentially offending them.</p><p>But these biases can play right into the cancel culture narrative &#8211; the act of boycotting an individual because of comments they&#8217;ve made or actions they&#8217;ve taken.</p><p>Some students have left school or been officially dismissed<b> </b>for posting racist content while in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2018/01/college_athelete_suspended_lea.html\">colleg</a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2018/01/college_athelete_suspended_lea.html\">e.</a> And unlike high schoolers posting about skipping sixth period, these students are older and their punishments are warranted. </p><p>High schoolers are still learning and should be afforded opportunities to make and learn from their mistakes, and their future educational opportunities shouldn\\'t be hindered by immature choices.</p><p>And there&#8217;s no one more immature than <u></u>a high-schooler on Instagram.</p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re young when you&#8217;re 14 or 15,&#8221; said Shivani Ghate, a third-year cognitive science and economics student.  &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make (bad behavior) okay, but people grow, change and evolve. It&#8217;s hard to draw that line.&#8221;</p><p>College applicants haven\\'t fully matured yet, and their social media reflect that. The rational part of a person\\'s brain isn&#8217;t fully developed until 25, so it doesn&#8217;t seem fair to judge these individuals based on comments made online.</p><p>Of course, these applicants did choose to put personal content online, so some people <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/02/10/social-media-may-prove-to-be-a-valuable-tool-for-college-admissions-officers/\">argue</a> that it&#8217;s public information. Anyone can access it, so it seems fair for college admissions officers to use it. In fact, they may be doing themselves a disservice if they don&#8217;t take all aspects of a candidate into account.</p><p>But admissions officers aren&#8217;t moral authorities who know exactly what&#8217;s acceptable for a person to post. The criteria are too subjective, and no standard besides a very general blanket ban on hateful rhetoric could feasibly be enacted.</p><p>The internet allows access to social media users\\' personal lives, and users need to be conscious of what they post in a more connected world.</p><p>But mistakes shouldn&#8217;t follow a person around forever, even though the internet is here to stay.</p>'\n",

But in fall 2019, UCLA  had an admission rate of approximately 14%. And last year, the university <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2019/05/30/ucla-proposes-lower-enrollment-rates-to-reduce-overcrowding-promote-graduation-rates/\">planned</a> to cap enrollment rates in order to fix overcrowding.</p><p>And UCLA Undergraduate Admission doesn\\'t look at social media, so many qualified students are already being turned away without the use of social media in admission. </p><p>Using social media accounts to assess a borderline student&#8217;s compatibility with a university is not only time-consuming, entirely subjective and not indicative of potential collegiate success, but also reflects an affinity for &#8220;cancel culture&#8221;<b> </b>that an influential university like UCLA should not support.</p><p>When evaluating a student&#8217;s application, colleges need to determine if a student and a university are a good fit for one another. </p><p>Gary Clark, director of UCLA Undergraduate Admission, said in an emailed statement that gauging a student&#8217;s potential success on campus is paramount to the admissions process.</p><p>&#8220;Our goal is to determine if we feel the student is a good fit for UCLA, meaning is the student able to both benefit from and contribute to UCLA in and outside of the classroom,&#8221; Clark said in the statement. </p><p>The university does not look at social media profiles to assess students\\' applications and instead strictly adheres to the 14 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/freshman/comprehensive-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">criteria</a> stipulated by the University of California, according to an emailed statement from UCLA Undergraduate Admission.</p><p>And while this method of admissions hasn\\'t been adopted yet, an increasingly digital world makes it difficult to know what policy the university will implement in the future.</p><p>It&#8217;s hard to determine a student&#8217;s ability to succeed from their social media profiles, as these profiles are often used to push a public persona rather than to reflect real life. A 2019 poll conducted by YouGov <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/technology/articles-reports/2019/10/31/social-media-content-often-unreliable-say-users\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found</a> that 41% of social media users in Britain claimed to have seen inaccurate content during a 30-day period.</p><p>As such, reviewing profiles would quickly become a waste of time for admissions departments. </p><p>&#8220;People use social media to reflect the recreation they engage in,&#8221; said Jason Mally, a fifth-year cognitive science and computer science student. &#8220;Besides LinkedIn, social media sites are not professional resumes.&#8221;</p><p>The content presented on each platform is different &#8211; not every post on Twitter is reflective of someone&#8217;s professional persona, nor is it indicative of their potential success as a student. </p><p>Inappropriate or even downright offensive posts are most likely what admissions officers are looking for.</p><p>But it&#8217;s hard to tell what admissions officers would consider when assessing social media accounts, and arbitrary decisions could set dangerous precedents. One positive social media post could propel an applicant over the edge, while one negative post could irreparably change their future.<br /></p><p>Applying for college is a stressful time, and any fair advantage a student can get in the process, they will take.</p><p>&#8220;I had friends in high school who thought universities might check their social media, so they went through and deleted whatever they thought put their chances at risk,&#8221; Mally said.</p><p>While this may just be pictures of partying or skipping class, it could also include purging social media of any controversial subject matter, like posts about political or other personal beliefs. Admissions directors are still people who have biases, so there&#8217;s no reason to risk potentially offending them.</p><p>But these biases can play right into the cancel culture narrative &#8211; the act of boycotting an individual because of comments they&#8217;ve made or actions they&#8217;ve taken.</p><p>Some students have left school or been officially dismissed<b> </b>for posting racist content while in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2018/01/college_athelete_suspended_lea.html\">colleg</a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2018/01/college_athelete_suspended_lea.html\">e.</a> And unlike high schoolers posting about skipping sixth period, these students are older and their punishments are warranted. </p><p>High schoolers are still learning and should be afforded opportunities to make and learn from their mistakes, and their future educational opportunities shouldn\\'t be hindered by immature choices.</p><p>And there&#8217;s no one more immature than <u></u>a high-schooler on Instagram.</p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re young when you&#8217;re 14 or 15,&#8221; said Shivani Ghate, a third-year cognitive science and economics student.  &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make (bad behavior) okay, but people grow, change and evolve. It&#8217;s hard to draw that line.&#8221;</p><p>College applicants haven\\'t fully matured yet, and their social media reflect that. The rational part of a person\\'s brain isn&#8217;t fully developed until 25, so it doesn&#8217;t seem fair to judge these individuals based on comments made online.</p><p>Of course, these applicants did choose to put personal content online, so some people <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/02/10/social-media-may-prove-to-be-a-valuable-tool-for-college-admissions-officers/\">argue</a> that it&#8217;s public information. Anyone can access it, so it seems fair for college admissions officers to use it. In fact, they may be doing themselves a disservice if they don&#8217;t take all aspects of a candidate into account.</p><p>But admissions officers aren&#8217;t moral authorities who know exactly what&#8217;s acceptable for a person to post. The criteria are too subjective, and no standard besides a very general blanket ban on hateful rhetoric could feasibly be enacted.</p><p>The internet allows access to social media users\\' personal lives, and users need to be conscious of what they post in a more connected world.</p><p>But mistakes shouldn&#8217;t follow a person around forever, even though the internet is here to stay.</p>'\n  list([]) list(['opinion', 'opinion-columns'])\n  '/2020/03/01/whether-admissions-officers-like-applicants-social-media-or-not-shouldnt-matter/'\n  153.0 146.0 119 125.0 0.768 0.7059000000000001 '$0.00'\n  '2020-03-01 22:37:28' 'todo']]\n"

       "       'The Bruins faced off against one of their toughest opponents yet  but managed to set season-best performances across the board.\\n\\nNo. 10 UCLA baseball (10-0) beat No. 18 Texas A&amp;M (10-2) 10-2 on Saturday in its second game of the Frisco College Classic to notch its tenth consecutive win to open the season. The win was the Bruins first against a ranked opponent in 2020, and they recorded season highs in hits and walks and tied a season low in runs allowed.\\n\\nThe offense got the scoring going early, plating two runs in the top of the first inning for the third game in a row. Redshirt junior designated hitter Jarron Silva  hitting in the No. 2 spot  singled with one out, and the next batter  sophomore shortstop Matt McLain  hit his team-high third home run of the season. The shortstop also leads the Bruins with 13 RBIs this year.\\n\\nThe Aggies got a run in the bottom of the first after the leadoff hitter, second baseman Bryce Blaum, struck out but reached first base on a dropped third strike. Sophomore right-hander Nick Nastrini threw two wild pitches to the next batter, advancing Blaum to third base, before he scored on a groundout.\\n\\nIn the top of the second, UCLA had the bases loaded with only one out, but failed to score. The second inning was the first of five frames that the Bruins left multiple runners on base, running up their tally up to 15 in the game.\\n\\nAfter leaving the bases loaded an inning earlier, the Bruins came back with another two-run home run in the third. Senior left fielder Kyle Cuellar hit his first home run of the season  his first long ball since March 10, 2017, against Texas  extending the Bruins lead to three.\\n\\nUCLAs biggest inning of the day came in the sixth, when the team scored four runs, bringing the score to 9-2. Sophomore catcher Noah Cardenas, sophomore second baseman Mikey Perez, junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell and Silva all helped knocked in runs in the frame.\\n\\nMaking his third start of the season, Nastrini went five innings and gave up two runs. The righty allowed only one hit  a one-out home run in the fourth inning by catcher Hunter Coleman  but walked four Aggies and hit one <b></b>batter. Nastrini finished the game with a season-high eight strikeouts.\\n\\nAfter Nastrini was pulled, the Bruins bullpen combined to throw four no-hit innings, walking three while striking out six. The bullpen has allowed just two earned runs in 36.1 innings of work this season  good for a 0.49 ERA.\\n\\nUCLA will play its last game of the Frisco College Classic on Sunday against Illinois at 9 a.m.',\n",
