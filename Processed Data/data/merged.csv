The original version of this article stated ""Klein, a lecturer at the Anderson School of Management, questioned the feasibility of the students request in his response.""   Nearly 20,000 people signed a petition calling for the removal of a UCLA lecturer on the grounds he violated UCLAs values.  Gordon Klein, a lecturer at the Anderson School of Management, is currently on leave according to an email sent to his class Thursday after  students created the petition in response to  his  response to a students request for finals-related accommodations. The student requested a no-harm and shortened final exam, and extended deadlines for final assignments and projects in consideration of black students wellbeing in light of    nationwide protests against police brutality   .&nbsp;      Do you have any idea if any students are from Minneapolis? I assume that they probably are especially devastated as well , Klein said in the email .   I am thinking that a white student from there might possibly be even more devastated by this, especially because some might think that they're racist even if they are not.    One last thing strikes me: Remember that MLK famously said that people should not be evaluated based on the color of their skin. Do you think that your request would run afoul of MLK's admonition?  he added.  An email from dean of the Anderson School of Management Antonio Bernado stated that associate professor Judson Caskey and professor Brett Trueman will take over Kleins courses for the remainder of the quarter.  Klein did not respond to requests for comment.  Anderson is currently investigating the email, according to an emailed statement from the school.  Respect and equality for all are core principles at UCLA Anderson, the statement read. We apologize to the student who received it and to all those who have been as upset and offended by it as we are ourselves.  Students circulated Kleins response on various social media outlets, catching the attention of many students.    Transcription &amp; original email included:  pic.twitter.com/arSZ2DqZMX    Tug (ACAB) (@only1tugger)  June 3, 2020       Preet Bains, a fourth-year climate science student, said he created the petition after seeing Kleins response on a Twitter post created by Cydni Willhite, a second-year English student, which received over 1,000 likes and reshares within a day.    another one bites the dust.  @UCLA   @UCLAchancellor   pic.twitter.com/Mdb7AkwEKh    cyd (@willhitecydni)  June 3, 2020       Bains said he thought Kleins response was unacceptable.  It was really backhandedly racist, he said. Speaking such sarcastic rhetoric ... really undermines the Black Lives Matter movement, making it seem like any students asking for accommodations during this time are doing it for selfish reasons and he's really discounting anything that students might be going through.  Jessica Singh, a third-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student and co-creator of the petition, said they have not yet received a response to the petition from UCLA.  Klein later notified students he would consider their situations when grading and urged them to adequately prepare for the exam after hearing horror stories from other faculty members of students not studying enough, in an email obtained by The Bruin.  Willhite, a member of the Afrikan Student Union, said she first saw Kleins response on an ASU GroupMe chat room and added she was not shocked.  Willhite said that in light of recent events, she feels people are revealing their stances with marginalized groups at UCLA.  I feel like everything is coming to light and not only professors, but ... all other UCLA faculty as well as different students are showing who they are, whether that be genuine allies to underrepresented communities at UCLA or 'All Lives Matter,'"" she said.  Willhite said ASU voiced its concerns to UCLA administration, including Chancellor Gene Block, regarding students capacity to handle schoolwork amid the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide protests. Willhite added that no accommodations were given before the petition was created.  ASU sent out a petition urging UCLA to postpone or cancel finals in consideration of students well-being in light of recent events.  The UCLA Academic Senate announced Wednesday it could not postpone or cancel finals campuswide, but offered instructors options to be flexible with their final exams and assignments, in an email sent to students. The senate provided alternate options for assessments including relaxed grading scales and proposed an opt-out option for finals.  Willhite said UCLA should give students accommodations because they are suffering repeated emotional trauma.  The importance of accommodations during this time is to show awareness to the traumatic events that are happening right now, Willhite said.",['cap-kari-lau'],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.news_.klein_.file_.jpg

Despite the uncertainty for fall, UCLA has moved all of summer session A and its pre-college programs online. Certain departments have also moved summer session C online, but no decision has been reached about fall quarter, according to multiple administrators and student government representatives.  The UC is using Gov. Gavin Newsoms six  criteria  for resuming normal operations in discussions about reopening campuses, said UC spokesperson Sarah McBride. The criteria include the availability of widespread testing and contact tracing, the ability of hospitals to handle patient surges and the ability of institutions and facilities to support physical distancing.  McBride said that while the UC will provide systemwide guidance, campus leadership and local health officials will determine how individual campuses reopen.  During a livestream town hall, Chancellor Carol Christ of UC Berkeley said she thinks fall semester is likely to be a hybrid of virtual and on-site instruction. She added she thinks social distancing and mask requirements may still be in place come fall.  Christ added that the extent to which the campus can return to normal operations will be impacted by the decisions made by public health departments and the federal government.  Chancellor Pradeep Khosla of UC San Diego  told  the San Diego Union-Tribune he thinks continuing virtual classes is within the realm of possibility. The campus has created a task force to work with public health officials to make a decision.  No fall 2020 decisions have been made yet for UCLA, said spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez. Nevertheless, undergraduate student leaders said they have been included in discussions about the possibility of remote learning in the fall.  Naomi Riley, the Academic Affairs commissioner for the Undergraduate Students Association Council, said she has met with Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Emily Carter, Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck and the Academic Senate about the impact of the pandemic on student learning. She added that travel restrictions, especially for incoming and current international students, will likely play a role in the decision.  For some international students who need visas, the earliest they could get those is November, said Riley, a third-year political science student.  Michael Meranze, chair of the UCLA Academic Senate and a history professor, said the senate will make recommendations about grading, course enrollment and assessments to faculty once administration makes a decision.  The senate has not yet determined whether they will continue the current suspension of normal regulations for Pass/No Pass classes in summer or fall, Meranze said.  During normal quarters, students can typically only take one class P/NP, and most classes that fulfill major requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, students can take unlimited classes P/NP and academic departments are encouraged to allow major requirements to be taken P/NP.  USAC President Robert Watson said an important factor in having on-site classes is UCLAs ability to accommodate public health guidelines such as physical distancing.  We have to consider social distancing possibilities, like if it is actually possible to hold these 200 person classes, said Watson, a fourth-year political science student. We dont know what that will look like in late September.  Watson and Riley said they think initially students were not included in important discussions surrounding COVID-19, such as winter quarter finals policies and 2020 commencement, however, the administration has since become more inclusive. Both Watson and Riley have been included in a task force with the vice chancellors to make a decision about fall quarter.  Riley added she thinks misinformation and uncertainty during the end of winter quarter led to stress among the student body, which could have been avoided by having student leaders at the table.  There is a system of shared governance in place, and I hope that when we look back at this (crisis) we see a student government, administration and Academic Senate that did everything it could, she said.",['cap-megana-sekar'],"['academics-news', 'campus', 'higher-education', 'news', 'student-government', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/royce4.NT_.jpg

The famous doughnut shop at the corner of Weyburn and Broxton avenues permanently closed in light of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a statement published by owner Stan Berman on the stores    website   .    It is with a sad heart that I inform you that I have made the decision to close my doors and (Thursday) will be the last day I will be making donuts, Berman said. Unfortunately COVID-19 made the decision happen sooner, but I hope that you will remember how our donuts made you smile for many years to come.    Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti    ordered    restaurants to close March 15 and Gov. Gavin Newsom    mandated    nonessential businesses to close statewide March 19 to slow the spread of the virus. Restaurants are still permitted to serve food to-go or offer delivery,   but the pandemic and the government response has nevertheless   constrained economic activity, putting many businesses in dire circumstances.       Berman opened Stans Donuts as The Corner Shoppe in 1965. Located in the heart of Westwood Village and right across from the historic Fox Theater, the shop has served over 75 doughnut varieties to generations of UCLA students, locals and tourists.    Stans Donuts &amp; Coffee, a shop inspired by Bermans original, opened in Chicago in 2014 and has since expanded to multiple locations.   Berman tried to expand Stans Donuts to other locations over the years but ultimately decided to only operate his Westwood shop.

Tuition and mandatory fees will remain the same, according to the email. However, UCLA is not able to guarantee housing for the 2020-2021 academic year because officials do not know how many students they can accommodate with the rapidly changing circumstances of the coronavirus.

If the university cannot fulfill housing requests, they plan to offer remote learning, according to the email.  Additionally, UCLA has established a Future Planning Task Force to make recommendations about academics, student experience, research, work, housing, and events and gatherings.

While UCLA has not made an official announcement regarding fall plans, faculty should be prepared to transition the majority of classes online for fall quarter, said Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Emily Carter in an open email to faculty.    Carter said it may be impossible or very difficult to teach some courses remotely, and some departments may consider offering in-person instruction for some small courses   while maintaining proper social distancing.    Many courses cannot be held in person because of space constraints due to a lack of university housing and the need for social distancing, Carter said.    Deans and department chairs should begin to review which courses can and cannot be offered remotely while ensuring they offer enough required courses, Carter added.    Despite the faculty message, UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez said in an emailed statement that discussions on fall quarter at UCLA are still ongoing.    The California State University system announced similar    plans    for the upcoming fall  the majority of its classes will be taught online except for a select few, such as laboratory classes.    UCLA announced Monday that summer session C, which starts Aug. 3 and ends Sept. 11, would be held virtually.    Chancellor Gene Block also said UCLA will not refund tuition fees even if fall quarter is conducted remotely, in an emailed statement late April.

Zoombombing, a new type of internet trolling, occurs when an individual or a group of individuals use Zoom features to interrupt a meeting or class. Following the cancellation of in-person classes due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, many professors have been using Zoom to hold classes, discussions, labs and office hours.  Phillip Valdovino, a third-year psychology and Chicana/o and Central American studies student, woke up early Tuesday to join the Zoom lecture for Chicano 143: Mestizaje: History of Diverse Racial/Cultural Roots of Mexico.  Within the first few minutes, however, a few voices interrupted the lecture spewing racial slurs, Valdovino said. The class was cancelled five minutes in.  Nyah Alexander, a first-year precommunication student,  tweeted  about the incident.  ucla has struggled with issues of racism on campus and it continues to be an issue even as we move to a digital learning platform, she said in the tweet.  Soon after, Jessica Jackson, a second-year African American studies student, witnessed another case of Zoombombing during her 11 a.m. Astronomy 3: Nature of Universe lecture.  About five minutes into the lecture, someone was presenting as if they had a question, ... and then finally, when the professor acknowledged the person, he just immediately jumped out with the N-word and was calling him that repeatedly, Jackson said.  Over time, I got my phone and started recording what was happening, Jackson said. It just then spiraled out of control  chaos.  Jackson later posted the recording on  Twitter .  Everyone's kind of in my Twitter DMs right now saying ... like wow UCLA students are the worst, she said. I really don't want to believe that these (Zoombombers) are UCLA students.  In an email to his Astronomy 3 class, Michael Rich, the professor, addressed the Zoombombing. Rich acknowledged the interruption and said the class would shift its structure to prevent future incidents.  Rich made two attempts at the lecture in order to continue the class. The first lecture did not have an access code, but the second lecture was protected with an access code. However, the access code did not prevent similar incidents, causing Rich to cancel the class for the day.  The technology is something I am new to, and I did not expect to have to take extreme security measures but it appears this will need to be the case, Rich said in the email. I am terribly sorry that this incident, which was upsetting, affected every student trying to learn in this class.  Jackson said this is the first time shes heard anti-black or anti-Semitic remarks in class.  This is definitely the first (incident for me), which I think makes it even more jarring, she said.  Alexandria Davis, a fourth-year political science and African American studies student and chair of the Afrikan Student Union at UCLA, is collecting student responses to the Zoombombing on Twitter, and she also recommends students report the incidents to the dean of students.  This is unacceptable and we need to protect students and faculty when it comes to this new online education system, Davis said on Twitter. No one should feel unsafe or unable to learn because of these new policies.  The Afrikan Student Union has called on the university to investigate the incidents and to take measures to prevent future ones, according to a statement published Tuesday on Instagram.  The Afrikan Student Union at UCLA is deeply concerned about these incidents and their effects on the wellbeing of students, the statement read. Black students specifically have been targeted by these hackers, causing added stress to an already chaotic situation. The current pandemic has uprooted students and prevented them from being able to thrive in the ways that they normally might be able to on campus.  The Afrikan Student Union plans to address the issue at the Undergraduate Students Association Council meeting Tuesday, which is streamed on the  USAC Live!  YouTube channel at 7 p.m.   Contributing reports from Jintak Han, Daily Bruin senior staff.

It really, really sucks. There isnt any other way to put it.  UCLA officials announced Friday that   spring quarter classes would be conducted entirely online in response to widespread cases of the novel coronavirus. Students were encouraged to return to their homes for the remainder of the academic year.  In a matter of hours, UCLA seniors bid farewell to their college careers three months too soon. Out went graduation photo shoots, Bella Pita and Fat Sals Deli runs, or any chance to bathe in the Inverted Fountain.  [caption id=""attachment_377348"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""530""]  The Inverted Fountain, created in 1968, serves as a place for graduating seniors to celebrate post-finals. (Courtesy of the UCLA History Project)[/caption]  There is no one to blame, really, for the situation. California currently has 335 cases of the novel coronavirus. Testing kits are nowhere to be found and the pasta aisle in Trader Joes is remarkably empty.  The schools actions in the middle of a pandemic are nothing short of necessary.  But that doesnt mean it doesnt hurt.  I raced out of Royce Hall on Monday evening, eager to sink into my living room couch. I didnt know that lecture would be the last in-person class I would attend at UCLA.  Maybe then, I would have taken   note of the creaking fold-over desks in the lecture halls. Or the particular angle Ive perfected over the past four years guaranteeing the most comfortable note-taking position. I probably would have stared at the historic brick buildings a little bit longer, maybe counted the steps down Bruin Walk.  The same path Ive walked through hundreds of times  headphones in, eyes glazed  is perhaps out of reach. Who knows if this pandemic will get worse, and it could be months before I ever return to Westwood.  Some students have already packed their bags and left campus for good. When UCLA initially announced that the first two weeks of spring quarter would be held remotely, some students made travel arrangements instantly.  For fourth-year international development studies student Mina Naziri, these friends were gone for good once the remainder of spring quarter classes would also be taught online.  The worst thing is, a lot of people left without saying goodbye,"" Naziri said. ""We said goodbye through text or Snapchat. This happened so quickly that people had to leave without saying goodbye. Saying goodbye is a privilege now; I wish I had that.  To make matters worse, goodbyes are easier when theyre tagged with see you again. In these unprecedented circumstances, however, no one really knows what will happen tomorrow. Or next week.  For me, at least, I simply don't know when   Im coming back to Los Angeles after spring break. Without work or in-person classes, I have no concrete   reason to be in Westwood. My only rationale for spending the quarter on these cracked, hilly streets would be because I missed my friends.  And then there's the rent I still have to pay.  Adieu aside, the most tragic part about this situation is the robbed experiences. Danny Robertson, a fourth-year history and sociology student, said that his last quarter at UCLA just doesn't exist without campus life itself.  ""We're not meeting professors, not interacting with students, not going to campus. I never even finished my last lecture  I fell asleep in it,"" Robertson said.  The preformed memories I had spent daydreaming of for the past year vanished. Since I first stepped onto campus my freshman year, I dreamed of walking into commencement, drunk off the future's adrenaline with my friends. I had always previewed   different graduation cap decoration ideas in my head.  In the end I had decided on this: I would use a copy of the Daily Bruin as the caps base. Then, Id write Cm n b m.  It means Thank you, Mom and Dad in Vietnamese.  I've always had a photo of my dad at his college graduation on my bedroom wall. He said that he never saw my grandmother happier than on his graduation day.  I can only dream of how happy he would have been at mine.

(Kristie-Valerie Hoang/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Im not sure whether UCLA will cancel graduation yet. UC Irvine already canceled commencement ceremonies, and we may very well be next. In the meantime, hope is a meager virtue propelling me through my day.  Whats happening is nerve-wracking, depressing and undeniably historic. But, this shared suffering serves as a reminder of our humanity. Theres some comfort in knowing that what Im feeling reverberates among 7,000 other seniors as well.

A post shared by   Kristie-Valerie Hoang  (@stateofkristie) on  Mar 13, 2020 at 9:27pm PDT         Luke Cooper, a fourth-year history student, said that, despite a difficult first quarter, he eventually found a home at UCLA.  I made roots here. A part of me loves LA now, and UCLA and Westwood. I thought I had at least one more quarter to say goodbye. From one email, all that is done, Cooper said.  I, too, made my roots in this town. I found lifelong friends, like the type that my kids would call Aunt and Uncle. I built my career. And most importantly, I learned to be me.  A part of me isnt sure if I regret not staring at Royce long enough and appreciating its unparalleled grandeur.

Online health services, however, are one thing students can&#8217;t afford to give up.  Campuses across the University of California have been thrown into the world of telehealth &#8211; and mental health services have arguably experienced the most positive effects as a result. UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services is now able to provide unlimited counseling sessions. At UC Berkeley, they&#8217;ve transitioned to the new telehealth platform Teledoc to provide online counseling as well as other services. CAPS at UC San Diego has expanded its hours, helping to accommodate students spread across the world.  The infrastructure seems to be working in the current situation, and individual campuses should continue taking all the steps possible to ensure telehealth services are continued beyond the end of this pandemic.   But more than anything, it&#8217;s the UC that will need to prepare itself for a conversation with another organization entirely &#8211; Anthem Blue Cross. Anthem is an affiliated insurance vendor for the UC Student Health Insurance Plan, which covers insurance for the student body across all University campuses.  Needless to say, any decision by Anthem affects the UC community. And when it comes to covering telehealth services, it has a big one to make.  In order to ensure continuity of telehealth services beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, health insurance companies will need to be on board. Currently, Anthem Blue Cross is covering online mental health services &#8211; but that could change with the advent of a post-coronavirus world. So while individual campuses can take steps to fund CAPS centers and provide resources for sustainable telehealth services, the UC needs to work with Anthem to make sure telehealth isn&#8217;t just covered for the current moment.  The unfortunate reality is that, when this pandemic is over, UC students will need telehealth more than insurance companies do.   The major mental health impacts of COVID-19, coupled with an economic downturn that could last for years, means students will need the flexibility to access mental health services outside the rent-burned boundaries of Westwood.  But the decision to continue telehealth services beyond the pandemic will land squarely on the shoulders of insurance companies, said Alexander Young, the interim chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences and the interim director of the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior.  &#8220;I wouldn't be surprised if a very large proportion of counseling or therapy remains virtual &#8211; in terms of how much it's going to happen depends in substantial part on the insurance companies and what they will cover,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;They had, in the past, been reluctant to cover telehealth.&#8221;  As of now, Anthem Blue Cross has been vague about its intentions for continuity of telehealth coverage, and its  expansion  to cover telehealth &#8220;until further notice&#8221; reeks of ambiguity.  For the present moment, that will do &#8211; but the University needs to start pushing them towards a definitive plan of action for the future.  Because if anyone has the leverage to do so in California, it&#8217;s the UC.  Anthem Blue Cross California  provides  student health insurance for all 10 UC campuses, as well as UC Hastings. Starting in 2017, the UC  chose  Anthem to provide PPOs for staff, faculty and retirees across the system for a three-year contract. In addition, UC Health and Anthem  have  a partnership under Covered California, the state&#8217;s insurance marketplace.  That is to say, the UC is a rather large customer.  And if it's a customer that chooses to fight for telehealth service coverage, students might actually have the upper hand in getting access to nontraditional care.   On a smaller scale, the institution is ready for a more permanent shift online.  Nicole Green, the executive director of CAPS, said once the technological issues were resolved, the transition to online counseling services went smoothly.  &#8220;I can reasonably say there probably will always be, from now on, some reasonable amount of therapy that we might be able to do (online),&#8221; Green said. &#8220;We now know how to do it and do it safely, and we've got the technology up and running.&#8221;  If entire schools have adapted this quickly, insurance companies can do the same.  Beyond the logistics, there will be a pressing need for flexibility of care after the pandemic ends. Students may remain scattered and off campus. And with experts now  warning  of a second wave of the coronavirus later in the year, it is more important than ever for schools to be prepared for an influx of students who need mental health support.  Between the exacerbation of socioeconomic divisions, the effects of xenophobia and the lack of comprehensive health care, the pandemic will have wide-reaching impacts on people&#8217;s mental health, Young said.  Ayushi Shroff, a third-year human biology and society student and the executive of Active Minds UCLA, said she thinks the coronavirus has changed the way students talk about mental health.  &#8220;It is very topical focused about stress and anxiety about coronavirus, but the discussion on mental health is present &#8211; that the suddenness, and uncertainty of the future is definitely affecting our mental health,&#8221; Shroff said.  These conversations are important &#8211; but without the long-term resource of counseling services, students may never get the professional help they need. And without telehealth services covered by insurance, campuses may never be able to get them that help.  Of course, Anthem is a private company, and it will make its own decisions regarding the continuity of telehealth services. But being the enormous customer it is, the UC has the means to pressure it into continuing telehealth coverage after coronavirus ends.  After all, contracts expire.  And if its insurance company won&#8217;t make the right choice, perhaps it&#8217;s time the UC go out shopping for new policies.

All UCLA libraries are now closed to the public. Students, staff and faculty with BruinCards will be allowed access, UCLA officials announced in an email Monday.    Powell Library, Charles E. Young Research Library and the Louise M. Darling Biomedical Library will be opened temporarily for the next three days, from 7 a.m. to midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday, and 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday. They will close entirely after Thursday.    Residential restaurants have also shifted entirely to to-go operations. Food at each buffet station will be served in to-go boxes, and dining hall staff will encourage students in line to keep at least 6 feet apart, the email stated.    Associated Students UCLA food options on campus also have either closed or moved to takeout operations only.    Tables will be removed from on-campus dining locations to spread diners out, and signs will be posted reminding students and visitors to stay 6 feet apart, the email stated. Restaurants closing include Veggie Grill, Wolfgang Puck Express, Northern Lights, the Music Cafe and Cafe Synapse.    All nonessential meetings and events are now suspended through spring quarter as well, and student workers are encouraged to work remotely wherever possible.    The email also asked faculty to consider the impact of coronavirus on students when making final grade decisions.    UCLA made the announcement it would move classes online in a Friday email.    All students were encouraged to return to their homes with their personal belongings for the rest of the academic year, said Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Emily Carter, Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Monroe Gorden Jr. in the email.    Students are still allowed to remain in on-campus housing for the duration of spring quarter and can keep their belongings with them.    Students who live on campus but return home for spring quarter will be allowed to cancel their housing contracts early and be refunded for their spring quarter housing and meal plan expenses. Students who cancel their contracts must bring their personal belongings home with them, the email stated.    All remaining UCLA study abroad programs were canceled. UCLA also suspended all nonessential university international and domestic travel.    The campus will remain open for research and international students. However, UCLA Recreation announced Sunday it would be closing all facilities until further notice starting on Monday.    Likewise, the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center and Counseling and Psychological Services will remain open.    F1 and J1 visas for international students will not be affected by the move online, the email read. Students receiving accommodations from the Center for Accessible Education have been informed of any changes or alternative accommodations, the email read.    UCLA had previously canceled in-person classes until just April 10, two weeks into spring quarter. Chancellor Gene Block announced Friday that he would be self-quarantining for 14 days after coming into contact with a person with the coronavirus.    Additionally, UCLA Health suspended all volunteer programs indefinitely.    The coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread to at least 140 countries.    Los Angeles County has 94 confirmed cases. LA mayor Eric Garcetti ordered that bars, restaurants, nightclubs and entertainment facilities close Sunday at midnight, in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.    Ayla Dvoretzky, a second-year civil and environmental engineering student, said while attending lecture on Zoom, a video conferencing platform, sounded fun at first, it quickly lost appeal when she realized it was going to be used for the entire quarter.    Dvoretzky added that she plans to take four very difficult and very collaborative STEM classes next quarter, which she was planning to tackle by working with her peers.    I was already really worried about the workload, she said. And I was planning to rely a lot on getting the help and support of my peers. And I know that that's going to be a lot more difficult now.    She said the whole situation makes it difficult to focus on finals.    I'm talking to my friends who I thought I was going to have another quarter with and trying to figure out who's leaving when and who's living where and how we're going to see each other, Dvoretzky said. And it's just a lot to think about and also worry about finals.    Dvoretzky said she thinks shes grown from the leadership positions shes taken on, the peers she has access to and the environment at UCLA, which can be lost in an online setting.    Much more of UCLA's value to me is that stuff that's not quite as quantifiable, rather than the academics of it, she said. And so I feel like I'm losing the more important part of UCLA, like on paper, sure, Im still getting taught by UCLA professors, but I don't feel like I'm getting the UCLA education that I worked and paid for.    Antonio Uyemura, a second-year microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics student said he was particularly frustrated with the way the information was communicated to students since he is an out-of-state student from Texas.    After the first announcement that canceled classes through April 10, Uyemuras parents booked him a flight home for Saturday. However, since the second announcement that UCLA would be moving all of spring quarter online came on Friday, Uyemura was forced to move out in 24 hours.    It was slightly frustrating to see how fastly the response escalated because it didn't really feel calculated because it was like, if you already had the intention to put it off for two weeks, why wouldn't you keep that and then reassess afterwards? Uyemura said.    He added he is now considering whether to defer for spring quarter and enroll in summer session C instead.    I pay all this money to go to this school in California, he said. So why would I take the school in Texas?    Simon Zhang, a fourth-year applied mathematics student, said he was happy when he first heard the news, but slowly realized some of the larger consequences.    Slowly I realized that like, oh no, that means like I wont be able to experience everything in spring quarter as I would have, Zhang said.    He added there are a lot of moments that he is missing out in as a senior.    I always had this picture of what my last couple weeks of my UCLA experience would be like, but obviously that's not gonna happen, he said. I haven't taken my grad photos yet. So I think that'll be really sad that I won't have photographed memories with my close friends. ... So it's just a lot of moments that I would have wanted to experience for the last time that I won't be able to get anymore.    Students can view updated information on the UCLA    website   . Students can reach a student support line at 310-825-3894 starting Wednesday for any issues they face regarding COVID-19 and its impacts. It will be open on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. ","['cap-kathryn-nucci', 'cap-julia-shapero', 'cap-marilyn-chavez-martinez']","['california', 'campus', 'international', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/breaking-1.jpg

Chancellor Gene Block announced in a statement Wednesday evening that all spring campus graduation ceremonies will be conducted virtually in an effort to combat the spread of the new coronavirus.  This decision will affect UCLAs College commencement, doctoral hooding and all campus graduation ceremonies. The largest commencement that will be impacted is UCLAs College, whose virtual ceremony will be held June 12.  Soon after students were notified via Twitter that commencements would be held online, several began a petition to postpone the ceremonies instead. The petition received over 2,500 signatures within two hours of being posted.  Students also responded on Twitter, calling the news upsetting and asking the school to postpone ceremonies.  UCLA officials will post a poll online at MyUCLA to get graduating students input on other in-person commencement options at a later date, said Patricia Turner, dean and vice provost for undergraduate education, in an emailed statement.  The poll will ask graduating students to choose their preferred celebration from three options: holding a virtual ceremony in the spring only; holding a virtual spring ceremony and an in-person ceremony in an as-yet undecided location sometime during the 2020-2021 academic year; or holding a virtual spring ceremony and an in-person ceremony in spring 2021 in Pauley Pavilion.  The poll will also provide a space for students to write in their own responses, up to 1,000 characters.  The university intends to post it Thursday, although it might be delayed because of the high demand on UCLAs online technology, Turner said. Turner added that she hopes students will be forgiving if it is delayed.  UCLA also hopes to extend use of the poll to students graduating from professional schools as well, although that may take another day, said Kelly Wahl, director of student achievement and special projects for the College of Letters and Science, in an emailed statement.  We also want very much to make the virtual commencement ceremony this spring unique and special for our graduates, as they await their opportunity to celebrate in the way they have anticipated, Wahl said.  The Undergraduate Students Association Council worked together to create the petition to postpone commencement ceremonies, said Millen Srivastava, the Financial Supports commissioner and a fourth-year biology and political science student.  She said a virtual ceremony isnt enough.  Its not just the students experiences, its also their (families) experiences, Srivastava said. Its the experience thats shared (for) all the sacrifices that their families and their communities have made for them.  Students pay fees for commencement that they should see results for, Srivastava said. Other universities, including the University of Michigan, Pennsylvania State and California State University Long Beach, have postponed their commencement ceremonies rather than moving them online, she said.  She said shes glad the university is seeking graduating students input. However, she said the way the school approached the issue was very disorganized.  Nobody in USAC had been notified of the decision to move ceremonies online prior to it being posted on Twitter, she said.  They posted a very affirmative decision on their Twitter page, their official Twitter page which they post all other official documents on, she said. So that sort of response was definitely justified from the student body.  The decision comes after the universitys announcement that it will suspend all nonessential events. Campus resources have been shutting down as well, including libraries, which will close entirely after Thursday, and UCLA recreational facilities, which have closed indefinitely.  The University of California Board of Regents meetings have been held via teleconference this year as well.  UCLA housing facilities and dining options remain open for students. However, UCLA dine-in restaurants have transitioned to to-go options.  The entirety of the universitys spring quarter will be online as well as the university continues to take measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  There have been at least two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UCLA community: a faculty member who works off campus and a student in off-campus housing.","['cap-marilyn-chavez-martinez', 'cap-kathryn-nucci']","['campus', 'news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.onlinebackground.jpg

Running back Joshua Kelley, cornerback Darnay Holmes and tight end Devin Asiasi have regularly made appearances in mock drafts this spring. By looking at general projections, NFL Scouting Combine results and roster fits, Sports editor Sam Connon made his picks for where each of them could wind up.   Darnay Holmes, cornerback   [caption id=""attachment_378866"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Kanishka Mehra/Assistant Photo editor)[/caption]   R.J. White, CBS Sports: No. 80 overall, Las Vegas Raiders   Chad Reuter, NFL.com: No. 84 overall, Los Angeles Rams   Kevin Hanson, Sports Illustrated: No. 95 overall, Denver Broncos   Vinnie Iyer, Sporting News: No. 97 overall, Cleveland Browns   Luke Easterling, The Draft Wire: No. 112 overall, Los Angeles Chargers   Dane Brugler, The Athletic: No. 143 overall, Atlanta Falcons   Matt Miller, Bleacher Report: No. 173 overall, Miami Dolphins      Holmes came to Westwood as a top-three defensive back in the country, and while he may not have lived up to that hype, he still managed to remain productive.  Holmes physical tools didnt measure up to the nation's top receivers, as the former five-star recruit was regularly burned outside the numbers early in his junior season. He has shown good ball instincts in his three years with the Bruins, however, as he racked up eight interceptions and 28 pass deflections in his 35 games with the program.  Coach Chip Kelly said NFL teams have told him they plan on using Holmes as a nickelback rather than the lockdown 1-on-1 corner UCLA asked him to be. That role should be a better fit for Holmes moving forward, as his 5-foot-10, 195-pound frame sets him up well to be a prototypical slot corner at the next level.  His size may have hindered his coverage skills in college, but his speed running across the field, in a new role, could do wonders for his NFL development. Holmes 4.48-second 40-yard dash ranked as 12th among the 29 corners who ran it at the NFL Scouting Combine, but his chasedown forced fumble against Arizona in 2018 showed off his elite in-game speed.  Teams like the Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys that desperately need a No. 1 corner are likely to take one early and might not be great fits for a projected nickelback like Holmes.  The Las Vegas Raiders pass defense ranked in the bottom half of the league in passing yards and completion percentage allowed last season, meaning they could be interested in adding a defensive back. With coach Jon Gruden at the helm and the franchise moving to a new market this fall, they could make a flashy offensive pick early in the draft and wait to address their needs in the secondary.  The Raiders had a deal in place to sign cornerback Eli Apple this offseason, but it fell apart and they have since been unable to find a replacement. With Apple off the table, Las Vegas could turn Holmes way late Friday or early Saturday.   Connons pick: No. 91 overall, Las Vegas Raiders    Joshua Kelley, running back      [caption id=""attachment_378867"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Daily Bruin file photo)[/caption]   R.J. White, CBS Sports: No. 119 overall, Atlanta Falcons   Vinnie Iyer, Sporting News: No. 126 overall, Los Angeles Rams     Dane Brugler, The Athletic: No. 128 overall, Buffalo Bills   Kevin Hanson, Sports Illustrated: No. 152 overall, Carolina Panthers   Matt Miller, Bleacher Report: No. 162 overall, Washington Redskins   Chad Reuter,   NFL.com  : No. 166 overall, Detroit Lions     Luke Easterling, The Draft Wire: No. 192 overall, Green Bay Packers   The 2020 draft is chock full of running backs, and that is not good news for Kelley.  There may not be a future superstar back in the class, but Kelley is one of nearly a dozen halfbacks with college production and solid intangibles to his name.  Wisconsins Jonathan Taylor, Georgias DAndre Swift, Ohio States J.K. Dobbins and Florida States Cam Akers boast higher ceilings and better stats than Kelley, while also carrying more name recognition.  That leaves the former walk-on to battle it out with Arizona States Eno Benjamin, Boston Colleges AJ Dillon, Utah's Zack Moss and others for a spot in the middle of the draft. Kelley has proven he has the IQ and hands to be a good receiving back, but his lack of production as a pass-catcher will likely be held against him. Benjamin and Moss have both proven to be more diverse prospects  with each of them racking up 300-plus receiving yards last season  while Kelley picked up just 71 yards on 11 catches in 2019.  Kelley was an every-down back in college, but he likely wont be able to keep that up on Sundays. His most attractive traits are his ability to read holes and carry defenders for extra yards, and he projects as a good goal-line and early-down back as part of a fluid running back committee.  The Detroit Lions are a team that could use a player of Kelley's talents, as they already have Kerryon Johnson, who can excel as a receiver and third-down back but lacks the ability to finish off drives.  The Auburn product has only scored three rushing touchdowns in each of his first two NFL seasons, and Detroit could be in the market for someone like Kelley who can finish off drives more consistently.  Johnson is good enough to prevent the Lions from drafting another running back early on, but given his recent injury history, Detroit is likely to give him some help in the backfield with a day-three selection.   Connons pick: No. 149 overall, Detroit Lions    Devin Asiasi, tight end      [caption id=""attachment_378868"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Axel Lopez/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]   R.J.

Asiasi has pro-level size, measuring in at 6-feet, 3-inches and weighing 257 pounds. He could benefit by losing a bit of weight, but Asiasi will have an NFL body no matter what.  Despite his appearance as a blocking tight end, Asiasi ran a 4.73-second 40-yard dash at the combine  good for seventh among tight ends  and his 641 receiving yards in 2019 ranked ninth at his position. His leaping ability and agility leave much to be desired, but he is still a big body with surefire hands.  His ceiling doesnt approach his contemporaries in this years draft, such as LSU's Thaddeus Moss or Notre Dame's Cole Kmet. However, a creative offensive coordinator and dedicated training staff could mold Asiasi into a weapon.  The New England Patriots fit that description, having traded tight end Rob Gronkowski to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Tuesday.  Coach Bill Belichick and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels have experimented with two tight end sets in the past, but with Gronkowski gone and Benjamin Watson retired, they'll need new playmakers to plug into their system.  The Patriots have more blatant holes on both sides of the ball that they will likely address early, setting them up to pick a tight end later on in the draft.     Connons pick: No. 172 overall, New England Patriots    The best of the rest   [caption id=""attachment_378869"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Daniel Leibowitz/Daily Bruin staff)[/caption]  Despite the fact that the Bruins will have double-digit candidates eligible for this weekend's draft, it seems only those three will end up getting picked.  Linebacker Krys Barnes slipped into the fifth round of WalterFootball.com's seven-round mock draft, but that was his only appearance on any major mocks. Kicker JJ Molson earned an invite to the combine in February, but only two kickers were drafted in 2019, and Molson is currently the fourth-ranked prospect at his position, according to CBS Sports.  Center Boss Tagaloa was on the preseason watchlist for the Rimington Trophy, given to the nation's top center, and he helped pave the way for Kelley's second straight 1,000-yard season by anchoring the middle of an offensive line unit that was constantly in flux. Tagaloa probably suffered the biggest blow by missing out on UCLA's canceled pro day, as his two seasons at center don't exactly give teams the biggest sample size to scout him adequately.  All three will likely sign contracts with NFL teams as undrafted free agents, and raw veteran linebackers like Jason Harris, Keisean Lucier-South, Josh Woods and Lokeni Toailoa could make brief appearances in camp as well.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['football', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.sp_.nfldraft.several.jpg

Unfortunately, that plan was little more than a list of online resources and of course, recommendations for frequent hand washing.  And students need more than an emailed plan to put them at ease.  Three UCLA students tested negative for COVID-19 on Friday. The following day, the university sent out an email detailing potential options like CCLE, Zoom and BruinCast if it must transition to online classes. But leaving it at that is far from the right course of action.  UCLAs population is the size of a small city, and transitioning 45,000 students and thousands of faculty to online-only classes will be no easy feat. Despite this, the university has remained unclear regarding how, when or if they will be implementing online final exams or remote classes in spring. And with the disease not projected to die down any time soon, UCLA needs to let students know what the plan is immediately  and get them ready if it comes to fruition.  Administrators may be relieved by negative test results, but thats no excuse for complacency.  UCLA is two weeks away from spring break, and many students will likely leave the state and country, potentially exposing themselves to the virus. And once Bruins start returning to campus, the university will likely face more than just negative test results.  A rising number of schools  totaling more than 20 as of Monday and including the University of Washington, Stanford, New York University and UC Berkeley  have already made courses entirely online for at least the next week. USC stated Friday that it is planning to test online classes this week in preparation for a further outbreak following spring break. UC San Diego just announced it will move classes online for the spring quarter.  Meanwhile, UCLA confirmed they do not plan to move all classes online at an information session tonight.  The university doesnt necessarily need to cancel classes right now, but there is a real possibility that cancellations may happen after spring break or sooner. And while administrators have proposed the possibility of an online setup, they should use this virus-free grace period to test their plan before it becomes a reality.  Because without a run-through, this will be an unnecessarily difficult transition.  Not only would this help students adapt to the impending change, but it would give those who may feel sick the option to attend class from home. UCLA has made it clear in its countless emails that students should stay home if they are sick. But in the final weeks of the quarter and with no consensus on a course of action, some students may have to choose between harming their academic standing and protecting the wellbeing of themselves and their peers.  If the university wants to nip this in the bud while protecting students, it should at least make online classes a more viable option.  The coming weeks hold major uncertainties about the spread of COVID-19. Whatever the case, UCLA claims to have a plan for classes should the virus infect Westwood.  But without practicing that plan, students and administrators alike wont be prepared for what they might come back to after spring break.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/edi-1024x618.png

The in-house tests make the UC system one of the first health systems in the country to offer such testing, according to the Sacramento Bee.

John Votava, director of Ralphs division at Kroger, confirmed to the Daily Bruin that five workers at the Westwood Village Ralphs have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. One has recovered and returned to work, he added. NBC4 Los Angeles first    reported    the news Thursday.     The cases came to light amid a series of outbreaks at some Southern California workplaces. There are currently 89 confirmed cases and an additional 35 symptomatic cases as of Friday at 12 workplaces in the region, according to a    running tally    by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.    However, the Westwood Village Ralphs is not included in the tally as of Fridaydespite NBC4 LAs reporting. A Hollywood Ralphs on Sunset Boulevard is experiencing the largest outbreak with 21 confirmed cases, up two from NBC4 LAs   original report ,according to LACDPH.   The Westwood Village Ralphs declined to comment for this article.    Meanwhile, United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 770, which represents Southern California grocery store workers, is   asking Ralphs to offer testing for store workers and customers   at the Sunset Boulevard location, according to NBC 4 LA.   A Ralphs spokesperson told NBC4 LA positive cases among employees are in the double digits and the chain is not offering in-store testing at this time, opting instead to rely on LA County  testing .  However, Ralphs associates will be offered testing options beginning around mid-May, contingent on symptoms and medical need, Votava said to the Daily Bruin in an emailed statement.  Gloves and face coverings are being distributed to every worker during every shift. Among other measures, Ralphs is making symptom checks mandatory for every worker before each shift, installing plexiglass shields at checkout stands and continues to sanitize high-touch surfaces every half hour, according to Votava.  Every worker on leave receives two weeks of pay ,  Votava added.","['cap-martin-bilbao', 'cap-hyeyoon-alyssa-choi']","['los-angeles', 'news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Image-from-iOS.jpg

These courses include laboratory courses, performing arts courses and other courses that would be difficult to conduct online  ,   Carter said in the email.    UCLA will provide on-campus housing   to a limited number of students based on a number of factors including financial need, the email said.&nbsp;    UCLA will also provide housing based on the enrollment preferences of third- and fourth-year students who may take courses or participate in extracurricular activities offered on campus. First-year housing will be determined in some part via a lottery system.    Campus life and extracurricular activities will still be offered both in person and remotely, in accordance with health protocols provided by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, the email stated.    International students can refer to the Dashew Center for questions about visa or work statuses, according to the email.    These plans are subject to change based on public health recommendations, according to the email.    Health precautions and protocols such as social distancing and wearing face coverings will be implemented on campus, Carter said in the email. Daily symptom checks will be required for everyone entering campus or living on the Hill, the email said.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced in a press conference Saturday that the state is working with the University of California and California State University systems to convert dormitories into hospitals in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.   The rooms may also house those experiencing homelessness, who are especially vulnerable to the virus, Newsom said.  In response, the UC has begun taking inventory of the available space to weigh the feasibility of retrofitting, said Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the UC Office of the President, in an emailed statement.  At no time would students on campus be commingled with those being sheltered temporarily, Holbrook said. UC will continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of students, faculty and staff.  Retrofitting dormitories is a joint effort between the UCOP, each UC campus, Sacramento and various state agencies, and all UC campuses have responded positively to the proposal, Holbrook said.   However, UCLA notified the UCOP that it will reserve residential halls for students who need on-campus housing, said UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez in an emailed statement.    Instead, the university will convert buildings such as the Luskin Conference Center and the UCLA Guest House if necessary, Vazquez said.    In total, UCLA will be able to contribute about 400 rooms to combat a growing shortage of medical facilities and supplies in the United States. Los Angeles County had 870 beds available for COVID-19 patients on Thursday and is not experiencing a shortage or surge in demand as of Friday.    The pandemic has put unprecedented stress on the California health system. Newsom said the number of COVID-19 patients requiring treatment may overload the states medical surge capacity of 10,000 beds by almost double. The state has also enlisted support from Elon Musk and other entrepreneurs in manufacturing ventilators, masks and other supplies.    Newsom said the state is exploring other avenues of expanding the states medical capacity and aims to secure 51,000 rooms across the state to house those experiencing homelessness.    Our most vulnerable Californians include the homeless: 108,000 unsheltered homeless in the state of California, Newsom said. We're trying to address the acuity of the crisis. In the moment, that's getting people off the streets, getting them into these units and (anticipating) the challenge in three, four or five, six months ... as this current crisis begins to shift.    President Donald Trump also approved Newsoms request Sunday to declare California under a state of major disaster. Trump will send the USNS Mercy, a Navy hospital ship, to Los Angeles, adding 1,000 beds to the countys health care system.

Students applying to UC schools from high school must also have completed a number of core courses by the time they graduate, known as A-G requirements. The UC will accept A-G courses taken pass/fail or credit/no credit during winter, spring or summer sessions.

Well that is, until students reached the line, We are weighing various factors and scenarios for the 2020-21 academic year.  And subsequently were not told any of those scenarios.  On April 28, UCLA students thought they were going to receive the long-awaited news from Chancellor Gene Block about what fall quarter would look like in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, students were left guessing about the future of campus closures, virtual classes and housing contracts signed and paid in full weeks ahead.  In that same email to students, UCLA indicated its capacity to house students on campus would diminish. However, it adamantly reaffirmed that students would pay the same in student fees and tuition.  In a May 13 message from Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Emily Carter, UCLA faculty were  instructed  to prepare for a remote fall and consider which of their courses could follow social-distancing guidelines. Not only did this message add to student anxiety  it also failed to specify which classes UCLA is considering for in-person instruction.  These disjointed announcements are no comfort to students, particularly those who are experiencing financial or housing insecurity. International and out-of-state students who will be paying thousands more in tuition dollars than in-state students also deserve clarity from the university. Given Los Angeles Countys      impending  extension of shelter-in place orders until the end of July, UCLA cannot afford to keep students in the dark. The university must tell students what scenarios it is considering in clear terms to allow them the time to make important decisions regarding their future plans.  And it must tell them now.  Jibran Ali, a third-year financial actuarial mathematics and international student, was immediately ushered back to Bangladesh by concerned family members when UCLA moved   to remote learning at the end of winter quarter.  UCLA hasn't said whether or not we're going online and whether I need the apartment, so logistically it is a bit of a pain, Ali said. And I want my senior year, I want a full year with all my friends and obviously that might be a bit too much to ask for at the moment, but I would like some clarity on knowing what I should be doing next.  While students like Ali are eager to return to campus if circumstances permit, they are also concerned that if UCLA is pushed to give an answer too soon, students will be getting the answer they do not want to hear  a completely digital fall quarter.  Timothy P. White, the chancellor of the California State University system,  announced  Tuesday that CSUs are planning for a completely virtual fall semester. While this announcement is sure to be a disappointment to students, it also gives them the necessary time to secure or break leases for the upcoming school year. Something that the UC should take into consideration for its students.  This preemptive move to online learning stands in stark contrast to the hectic last weeks of winter quarter Bruins were forced to undergo.  Roger Detels, a professor of epidemiology and infectious diseases and dean emeritus of the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, understands the need for virtual learning but misses the in-person art of lecturing.  We had lots of warning in the United States about this virus, and we really did not get started on intervention and management of the epidemic until very, very late, Detels said. I think UCLA actually responded pretty well once they recognized that they were dealing with a highly infectious disease and that a university was an ideal setting for rapid spread of the epidemic  they took action by going virtual.  Winter and spring instruction were moved quickly and efficiently online in a matter of weeks when UCLA finally reacted to a pandemic that had been affecting the world for months. However, it was hastily planned and students were left scrambling to move out of residential buildings amid the stress of finals week.  While fall quarter is still four months away, UCLA must think ahead for the sake of its students. Those four months are precious time students could be using to sort out living arrangements, finances and more.  William Pua, a third-year sociology transfer student, believes the effects of these changes on the transfer community are especially devastating.  There's some people that I know that signed their leases already, Pua said. (UCLA) even told the transfer students, who are guaranteed one year of housing, they might not be able to get that guarantee.  UCLA students deserve to know the best and worst case scenarios for their fall quarter, so they have the time to plan and prepare for the worst  or remain hopeful for the best.  It appears UCLA is hesitant to announce its plans out of a desire to avoid panicking or discouraging students. But, by not being as transparent as it possibly can, it is already doing just that.     After all, there is no need for students to cancel leases or declare nonenrollment if campus will remain open and most classes will be offered in-person. But whether that is   possible is still largely unknown.  However, this thought process only works when the student body has the same privileges as the chancellor and university officials making the decision.  Some UCLA students simply cannot afford to continue online schooling. Nor can they continue to wait on the university for answers. Students need pertinent information   from the university so they can make their own decisions.   Especially if the option of an in-person fall is completely off the table.  But in   the meantime, students will have to make do with vague and nerve-wracking emails that fail to give a full picture of what their upcoming school year will look like.  The nation's top public university owes its students a follow-up email with more than just sympathies and platitudes.",['cap-rachel-durose'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.op_.durose.UCLAhousing.file_.jpg

The Los Angeles Police Department held dozens of detained protesters in the parking lot of a UCLA-leased athletics facility Monday. The detainees sat handcuffed in cramped cages inside buses   for hours without access to water, food or bathrooms.  &nbsp;    The LAPD declined to immediately respond to repeated requests for comment Tuesday.    Rachel said she was among dozens detained by the LAPD from across the city and bussed to Jackie Robinson Stadium. Jackson said he was on one of several more buses taken to the stadium, each carrying dozens of detained   protesters.   They and the other protesters were kept in cages on the buses for as long as six hours, Rachel said.    The bus that I was on had cages in them to fit two to eight people, Rachel said. We had no windows; I was in a cage that was locked, in the back of the bus.&nbsp;    Lisa and her friends, who are college students, said they were driving past the downtown protest when the LAPD detained them on a curfew violation, despite the driver having an essential worker exemption to the curfew.    The LAPD used the parking lot of the stadium as a command post in preparation for a planned protest in Westwood with the approval of UCLA staff, said LAPD spokesperson Mike Lopez in an emailed statement Wednesday.&nbsp;    The detained protesters were among thousands protesting police brutality nationwide, following George Floyds death May 25 in Minneapolis police custody.    [Related link:    Westwood protest continues despite cancellation, police detain at least 10   ]    Detainment in the buses was both physically and psychologically taxing, especially after four hours of being handcuffed, Rachel said.    The hardest aspect of being on the bus was the psychological element in addition to being physically restrained, Rachel said. Not having access to the outside world (or) knowing where we were was really challenging.    Lisa said police officers significantly raised the volume on their radios to drown out the protesters yelling and banging on the sides of the bus.    People were having panic attacks, one girl had epilepsy and another was pregnant, Lisa said.    Lisa said the police only responded to a girl having a panic attack after several minutes of screaming for emergency medical assistance. Lisa added she is unsure what happened to the girl after she was led off the bus.    Rachel said two women in her bus needed medical attention and the detained protesters had to call 911 twice. The two women were eventually released to emergency responders after a long delay, she added.    Lisa said none of the LAPD   officers took the situation seriously.    It was all just a joke to them, Lisa said, While they (were) processing us, they would call out our names. They would, as a joke, start saying names like Michael Jackson, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. It was really just a game to them.    After they were released, the stadium-detained protesters were not provided basic necessities or transportation home, Rachel said.    Almost every single person that was getting released was completely stranded there, Rachel said. Everybody had no food, water (or) access to a cell phone.   ...   A lot of peoples phones were dead (and) there were no outlets. We were basically on a deserted road somewhere, public transportation was down (and) Ubers werent coming.&nbsp;    The city of LA previously operated a coronavirus testing center at the stadium, until Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Saturday that all city testing centers would close because of the ongoing protests.    Although the LA Fire Department asked permission before using the parking lot as a testing center, the LAPD used the stadium to process arrests   without UCLAs knowledge, said UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez in an emailed statement.    Several weeks ago, LAFD asked UCLAs permission to utilize the parking lot as a COVID-19 testing area and the university granted that permission, Vazquez said. However, UCLA did not receive a request from the LAPD or any other city agency to alter the use of that space last night into a field jail for processing arrestees.    UCLA leases the Jackie Robinson Stadium from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, but the university does not own the stadium or its parking lot, Vazquez said.    UCLA officials were aware that the VA allowed the LAPD to use the stadium parking lot Monday as a staging area, according to a Wednesday    statement    from Chancellor Gene Block and other UCLA officials.    However, UCLA was not informed that the lot would be used to process arrests, according to the statement.    We were never informed that it would also be used to process arrests, the statement read. But allowing the LAPD to use the space even for staging during these recent protests was a mistake.    UCLA will not approve future police requests to use the space to process arrests, Vazquez said.    Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck will meet with LAPD officials Wednesday to discuss the future use of the stadium for law enforcement purposes, said Assistant Vice Chancellor of Campus Life Mick Deluca at the Undergraduate Students Association Council meeting Tuesday.&nbsp;    Jackson said he was unsurprised by the conditions of his detainment at the stadium Monday.&nbsp;    I was disappointed, but not at all surprised about what the conditions were like, Jackson said. This is absolutely characteristic of the police and the police state that we live in. This is how they treat people once theyre detained.

All UCLA home games will be spectator-free through April 10. The university is also working to cancel nonessential gatherings of more than 100 people.    The transition follows other universities across the state, including UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, USC, UC Santa Barbara and Stanford University, who have all already made the transition to online classes at least temporarily.&nbsp;    Angela Lee, a social welfare graduate student, said she thinks the announcement was late because other schools already announced they were closing or canceling classes.    They need to show concern for the students and faculty, she said. It was a bit late. ... We were all waiting for it.    Multiple classes canceled finals entirely. Others made other accommodations, such as Communication 187: Ethical and Policy Issues in Institutions of Mass Communication, whose professor will be emailing out its final at the beginning of its scheduled exam period and requiring students turn in their answers by email or in person by the end.&nbsp;    Rashell Khalfin had two in-class finals scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday.

LA Mayor Eric Garcetti announced May 13 that individuals must wear face coverings whenever they are outside or will come into contact with somebody. Face coverings can range from scarves to bandanas as long as they cover the nose and mouth, he said.  &#8220;By telling people to always wear face coverings, we don&#8217;t want people seeing it as a further restriction but as part of expanding the freedoms that we currently have,&#8221; said Jordan Burns, a communications associate of the mayor.

LA County is one of the few counties in California that does not have  clearance  from the California Department of Public Health to move deeper into Stage 2 of California&#8217;s roadmap for reopening, which includes opening schools and dine-in restaurants with modifications.  LA remains in the early phase of Stage 2, which only allows for a limited reopening.  Even with the California Department of Public Health&#8217;s county variance benchmark announced May 18, which lowered the criteria for counties to reopen their economies, LA County still does not meet the necessary hospitalization and positive test metrics to advance further into Stage 2,  according to the California Department of Public Health.   Due to the relatively high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, the city of LA is implementing a more restrictive approach than the statewide directive. Garcetti said that the city is using the number of deaths in a 14-day period to assess its readiness to reopen &#8212; if the number continues to stabilize or decrease, the city will continue to loosen its lockdown, he said.  Over the past two weeks, the average number of deaths and hospitalizations in LA County decreased, allowing Garcetti to partially lift his ""safer at home"" order.  Garcetti modified his  ""safer at home"" emergency order  May 13 and May 22, authorizing curbside services for certain nonessential businesses and reopening some public recreational spaces for exercise purposes. The updated order also mandated all individuals, except children below the age of two and people with certain disabilities, to wear cloth face coverings during most outdoor activities.  Beach access points, parks, park trails and trailheads in LA reopened as of May 13, along with bike paths and city parking lots beside Cabrillo and Venice beaches May 22. Piers as well as most recreation and park facilities remain closed.  LA residents may now visit beaches, but only for solo recreational purposes such as swimming, surfing, running and walking. Those engaging in water activities are exempt from wearing face coverings. Among other activities, sitting, gathering, sunbathing and playing group sports are not permitted.  As summer approaches, crowded beaches could become an inevitable reality. Although Garcetti noted that stationing law enforcement at public beaches would be his last resort, lack of compliance with the stay-at-home order might call for stricter regulations.  Garcetti added that although health experts say pools do not transmit the virus, public pool reopenings are still far-off because of the difficulties maintaining social distancing within the pool and pool area.  In terms of businesses, Garcetti announced May 22 that all retail shops can commence pickup and delivery services. Stores at indoor malls will also begin to offer curbside service to shoppers.  Closer to home, residents can walk and jog, as long as they carry a face covering in case they come in close proximity to another person; however, people do not have to wear a mask while running.  The next phase of Stage 2 is likely to include opening certain businesses to physical customers but with a maximum of 25% capacity, Garcetti said during a media briefing May 15. In other counties, restaurants have already opened their doors for reservation-based dine-ins.  LA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger announced May 19 during the LA County Economic Resiliency Task Force meeting that the county intends to reach Stage 4 &#8211; the end of the stay-at-home order &#8211; by July 4, after which LA will resume travel and nonessential activities such as the operation of nightclubs and live audience sports.

The UC Board of Regents also adopted a new set of standards at its meeting to help campuses determine whether they can resume in-person operations in the fall. UC campuses will plan how to host fall quarter or semester after they have incorporated these standards.    Every campus will be open and offering instruction, Napolitano said. The question will be how much of that instruction is in-person versus how much is done remotely.    The reopening of on-campus activities must follow state and local public health department orders, as well as expert advice, according to the guidelines.    To meet the guidelines, the UC must implement screening, testing, contact tracing and other appropriate COVID-19 practices to inform campus decisions and limit the spread of the disease. Additionally, campuses must adopt rules to encourage physical distancing and universal face coverings.    Campuses will also need to be prepared to adjust to rapid changes in public health conditions, according to the guidelines.    The campuses plan to make a decision about fall operations by around mid-June, Napolitano said.

Emmanuel Gomez, a journeyman electrician working at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, died Friday at another hospital, according to a Teamsters Local 2010    webpage    dedicated to Gomez. He was 49.    Our leadership has expressed deepest condolences to the employees family and department leaders offered support to co-workers during this difficult time, a UCLA Health spokesperson said in an emailed statement.    Gomez was one of four Teamsters Local 2010 members at UCLA who tested positive for the coronavirus. The four workers belonged to the same unit and contracted the disease as a cluster, said Jason Rabinowitz, secretary-treasurer for Teamsters Local 2010.

(Courtesy of the Gomez family)[/caption]   Our union is like a family and weve lost a brother, Rabinowitz said. He was working in the hospital, pulling a lot of overtime during the crisis. He was in there as an essential worker helping to keep the Ronald Reagan hospital up and running for the patients during this crisis.    Rabinowitz said he believes Gomez was infected at work because Gomezs coworkers contracted the disease as well, adding that he thinks the university did not provide sufficient protective equipment for its workers.    We had to fight to get those respirators, those N95 masks, and once you get them you also have to be trained on them, and you have to be fit tested to make sure that the mask actually is working right, Rabinowitz said. The N95s that our members were trained and fit tested for were different than the ones that they actually were provided.    UCLA Health addressed the fit testing problem only after Gomez tested positive and the union called an emergency meeting with the university, Rabinowitz said.    UCLA Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this matter.    The Teamsters Local 2010 union, which represents staff members in higher education institutions, also urged the state and employers to provide more personal protective equipment, hazard pay and paid sick leave, in order to help prevent more cases.    Gomez is survived by his wife and three sons. The union is working on setting up a fund to assist Gomezs family and is also planning a vigil or memorial.

However, international students often have more factors to consider, like navigating travel restrictions, employment complications and attending class from different time zones. Some decided to stay in Westwood, where others returned to their home countries despite all the obstacles.   Staying in Los Angeles   Richard Clement Kusuma, UCLAs international student ambassador for Indonesia, will be staying in his Westwood apartment for his final quarter at UCLA.  Im staying no matter what happens, since, who knows, this could be the last moment Im staying here with my friends, said Kusuma, a fourth-year economics student.   [RELATED LINK:  Seniors reflect on leaving friends, UCLA as spring quarter moves online ]   Some international students planned to remain in their apartments or the Hill dorms for the rest of the academic year, as they felt staying on campus was an easier option than the restrictions and potential coronavirus exposure of international travel.  During her isolation on campus, Linwei Li, a second-year biochemistry student from China, said she returned to some of her old hobbies during spring break to occupy herself and deal with the stress of waiting for winter quarter grades.  She recently started drawing Powell Library, something shes wanted to do since her freshman year.  Many universities across the country, such as  Harvard   University , closed down their dorms entirely, forcing all students to find a place to stay. Li said she is glad UCLA is providing resources for students staying on the Hill.  Like Kusuma, Vaibhav Gupta, a second-year electrical engineering student from India, decided to stay. He felt life at home wouldnt be much different than staying on campus.  My position has always been, What am I going to do if I come home? Gupta said. I have nothing to be doing at home, and I've got nothing much to be doing here either, but I cut out the risk of travel and all that jazz.  After UCLA announced classes were going online for the entirety of spring quarter, many of Guptas friends flew home quickly, partly because of pressure from parents to do so. But his case was different.  I dont think either of my parents are particularly stressed out, Gupta said. I think from the moment spring classes were shifted online, the communication has been pretty clear; theyve been pretty relaxed about it.  Gupta said he thought that, although the administrations initial response was slow, UCLA has been handling the pandemic as best it can.  I think people have been a bit unfair to UCLAs admin team, Gupta said. Their responses have been pretty good and they've been doing the best they can in a pretty (messed) up situation.  Many international students, including Kusuma, want to stay in the United States after graduation, but the pandemic has made that process much harder.  An international student studying in the U.S. typically does so on an F-1 Visa, which allows the visa holder to enter the U.S. as a full-time student at an academic institution.  However, if the student wants to stay after graduation, they would have to apply for a post-completion Optional Practical Training authorization, which would allow them to remain temporarily in the U.S. after graduating as long as they are employed in a field related to their studies. Kusuma is one such applicant.  OPT applicants from UCLA have to go through the Dashew Center for International Students to complete the application. The center moved to remote work for the pandemic, however, leaving students to deal with more of the application responsibilities and making applying a more time-consuming process.  [caption id=""attachment_378089"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Senior international students who want to stay in the United States after graduating must apply for a post-completion Optional Practical Training authorization. OPT applicants from UCLA have to go through the Dashew Center for International Students to complete the application. However, the center is now working remotely amid the pandemic, leaving students to deal with more of the application's responsibilities and complicating the process. (Daily Bruin file photo)[/caption]  Instead of submitting all the required materials to the Dashew Center for it to mail to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, they have to apply to get any supplementary material needed from the Dashew Center and mail all the documents to USCIS themselves, Kusuma said.  Furthermore, international students arent certain whether they must be physically in the U.S. to apply. USCIS has not issued any COVID-19 pandemic-related provisions that allow students to file their OPT applications while overseas, according to to  the Dashew Center website .  Although Kusuma has already filed his OPT application, some other graduating international students have returned home and are hoping for the best, he said.  And with many companies freezing their hiring processes during the pandemic, even finding employment after graduation is a concern.  Kusuma recently received an email from one of his recruiters telling him his job interview has been put on hold. He still has a few prior internships, though, and he will be working at another one during spring quarter, so he still has hope. However, if he fails to get a job related to his field of studies or maintain his student status, he will have to leave the U.S. when his visa expires.  Im still going to do my best, he said, Ive prepared myself if I have to go home, but at least Im trying my best first.  Finally, international students in LA still have family to worry about back home.  Kusuma is concerned about his parents. Indonesia currently has the most COVID-19-related deaths in Southeast Asia, but  research  by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests as few as 2% of the countrys cases may have been reported.  His hometown, the capital Jakarta, has been hit the hardest. On March 28, Jakartas governor extended its state of emergency by two weeks, following the rapid rise of cases.  However, many people in Indonesia are still going outside, Kusuma said.   Returning home   The day Salsa Mazlans 24-hour flight landed in her home country of Brunei, the nation announced mandatory self-isolation for all incoming passengers.  Brunei, a small island nation near Malaysia and bordered by the South China Sea, has reported 135 cases of the coronavirus and one death due to COVID-19 as of April 6, according to  a report  from the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection.  Mazlan, a second-year anthropology student and the international student ambassador for the country, was met at the airport by officials from both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health. The Brunei Ministry of Education has taken an active role controlling the spread of the virus from international students, meeting with students coming from abroad to help them in their transition to isolation, Mazlan said.  She spent two days alone in a hotel room before the government called and told her she had the option to self-isolate at home, which she immediately took.  On the drive back home from the hotel, when I was able to really feel the sense of what Brunei roads were like or the greenery or the houses, that's when it really dawned on me that I did miss a lot of these things, Mazlan said.  Shed been briefly unsure shed even be able to get home. Before her exam Monday of finals week, Mazlan received a notification saying her flight had been canceled.  So I told my parents, Could you please help me? Mazlan said. It was quite alarming for me to have to deal with that.  Mazlan and her parents spoke with the airline company and secured another flight on the Wednesday of that week.  Ophelia Sin, a second-year geography student and the international student ambassador for Hong Kong, said she had family in LA to drive her to the airport to catch her flight to her home country  her parents were too nervous about the new coronavirus to let her take an Uber.  The precautions Sin took made traveling home tedious, Sin said.  I actually poured like ... 70% (sanitary) alcohol into a small bottle, she said. And I just brought it onto the plane with me and like, as soon as we got it to our seats we just stood there and we sprayed everything.  Sin, who was traveling with another friend from UCLA, said the two even donned UCLA ponchos, surgical masks, glasses and gloves to protect themselves throughout the journey.  Additionally, Sin said she avoided eating unpackaged food and drinking water offered during the flight, as well as other facilities on board.  I didn't use the bathroom at all, she said. It was a 16-hour flight, and I didn't use a bathroom. I heard it was dangerous.  When she reached the airport, the Hong Kong government gave her a wristband that would track her location to ensure she remained in isolation for 14 days, Sin said.  Returning residents would download a mobile application that would scan the wristbands QR code to track their location. The app would send a notification at the end of the 14 days, letting residents know they would be allowed to cut the wristband off, Sin said.  However, the local health department didnt send a text to Sin or her friend, and hence both were unable to enable the app and its features.  So like, there's really no point since like, they can't track (my) location, she said.  Although the wristband cannot monitor Sin, she said leaving the house wearing it would be a mistake.  [caption id=""attachment_378090"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    When second-year geography student Ophelia Sin reached the airport, the Hong Kong government gave her a wristband intended to track her location to ensure she remained in isolation for 14 days. Leaving the house wearing it could lead to being sent to a quarantine camp. (Lauren Man/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  If people see you, they will report you to the police and ... people will come and grab you and send you to a quarantine camp, Sin said. And after 14 days, they will send you to court.  Attending online classes from different time zones provided additional challenges to scheduling and some students education.  Although Mazlan said she received support from professors she reached out to individually, she hopes the university will establish accommodations for international students to ensure, for example, that students in different time zones can take classes without major inconvenience.  While the time zone difference between Hong Kong and LA made classes more difficult to navigate, Sin has found herself able to handle her coursework as the quarter begins.  There's definitely a lag time to that, but thankfully those classes arent too demanding academically for now, Sin said.  Mazlan said she understood the difficulty for some international students being unable to fly home due to travel restrictions and hoped they would be able to find a supportive community around them and routine to keep their spirits up.  Read the things that you've always wanted to read, watch the things that you've always wanted to (watch) or, you know) pick up a new skill,"" Mazlan said. ""And if you want to, you can document your time now in self-isolation, or your time away from home, just because it really is like a point in time where we're making history.

This is the kind of question students have been facing as they build a proportional, detailed replica of the UCLA campus  in Minecraft.  Choosing the right blocks and building UCLA structures at a 1-to-1 scale, where each Minecraft block measures a real-world meter, is no small task. However, their goal goes beyond creating a perfect replica.  We wanted to make the UCLA community whole again, said Noah Molloy, a second-year electrical engineering student and co-administrator of the UCLA Minecraft server.  &nbsp;  [caption id=""attachment_378470"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    The Mo Ostin Music Cafe.

Only a few days before, UCLA had announced that spring classes would be held online as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.  By then, many students had already moved out in a hurry, without time to say goodbye to campus.  I feel like when we're all kind of denied access to campus, we immediately want to recreate it so that we can go back, Molloy said.   [Related Link:    Seniors reflect on leaving friends, UCLA as spring quarter moves online ]     The server has gotten a lot of attention. Sunny Yen, co-founder and former president of Bruin Gaming and founder of UCLA Esports, said Monday afternoon that 736 unique accounts had visited the server.  Bruin Gaming promoted the server on its Twitter account and other platforms. At its peak, 40 to 50 players could be seen on the server at once, Molloy said.  Minecraft is an online sandbox game where players can explore natural landscapes and build from their imagination, all in the form of cubes that players can break and place.  The UCLA Minecraft server contains a creative world, where players have unlimited blocks to build with, and a survival world, separate from the campus build, where players gather materials and build their own structures.  What other activity exists where you get to meet people from different corners of the globe, and you're collaborating and building something? said Ryan Dougherty, a graduate student in social welfare, about Minecraft.  [caption id=""attachment_378471"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    So far, players have built the Janss Steps, Royce and Powell, the Schoenberg Music School and the Student Activities Center. They've also begun work on Dodd Hall. (Courtesy of Noah Molloy)[/caption]  &nbsp;  To find the campus, a player must join the server, then teleport to campus using a command. They then find themselves at the foot of Janss steps, the replicas of Royce Hall and Powell Library looming in the distance.  Along with these two famous buildings, players have already built the walls of Dodd Hall and the Mathematical Sciences Building. Young Hall floats high in the sky over South Campus, waiting to be placed.  Beyond the stunning facades, the server also features several of the well-known spots and beloved idiosyncrasies of campus.  Potion-brewing stands serve as makeshift coffee machines in the Evelyn &amp; Mo Ostin Music Caf. Beloved huskies Elvis and Princess, in the blocky form of Minecraft dogs, are leashed to the Bruin Bear.  And as players walk up Janss Steps, a booby trap removes the sixth step to reveal a tomb, in reference to a myth popular among tour guides.  We didnt come into this going, Were going to build the best 1-to-1 re-creation ever, said Yen, who graduated in December 2019 as a sociology student. Were just here to have fun.   UCLA  Under Construction, Like Always   For the most part, there is no formal leadership on the server, and players are encouraged to build whatever part of campus they know well, Molloy said.  Coordination is a little questionable, Yen said.  Signs litter the world with edit suggestions from unidentified builders. Some of the buildings, such as the detailed renditions of Royce and Powell, are marked with signatures  signs with the usernames of individuals who took on the build.  Ive seen people add their own little touches to various buildings, Molloy said. Just really polish certain features of buildings that might have been overlooked by the original builder.  &nbsp;  [caption id=""attachment_378472"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Schoenberg Music Hall. (Courtesy of Noah Molloy)[/caption]  Carmen Voskuhl, a third-year vocal performance student, worked with her group of friends in the small vocal performance program to build an accurate replica of both the exterior and interior of Schoenberg Hall.  They made it as true-to-life as possible, down to the furniture in each room and even mock advertisements for music school performances.  The friends know the building well, having spent so much of their time on campus in it. They filled in the gaps of their knowledge with a floor map someone had found of the building, Voskuhl said.  The casual and chaotic approach of the Bruin Gaming server has had its downsides. A few players came to the server early on to damage the build, Molloy said.  He thinks the culprits  griefers, as they are called in the online gaming community  were UC Irvine and UC Berkeley students, based on the locations they connected from, but theres no proof.  The server now requires potential builders to contact an admin from their UCLA email account to receive building permissions in the campus world.  Thats not to say students are discouraged from participating.  This project is big, Molloy said. We need a lot more people to help out.   Whats it all for?   One reason founding players began the build was to potentially use the location for a mock graduation ceremony, Molloy said.  Molloy said he has also seen a lot of prospective UCLA students visiting the server in an impromptu, virtual version of a campus tour.  Kids as young as 12 years old have wandered through the server, Yen said.  I thought that was hilarious. ... They want to, I guess, interact and see what its like to be a college student, Yen said.  But the biggest draw of the server, for Voskuhl, at least, has been the chance to see her friends again.  Before the pandemic hit, Voskuhl spent most of her time with her vocal performance friends. Playing online games has allowed them to stay in touch, even in self-isolation, she said.  Its honestly a good coping mechanism for all this chaos, Voskuhl said.  Other players have even donated to Bruin Gaming when the server had technical issues because theyd met good friends through the server, Yen said.  Molloy said that players offer varying time commitments, some, he would guess, putting in hundreds of hours.

A university staff member who lives in an on-campus apartment and a student who lives in off-campus housing not owned by the university tested positive for the novel coronavirus, UCLA announced Saturday. The two new cases bring the total to seven in the UCLA community.    The university did not disclose when the staff member and the student received their test results on its case update    page   . The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced Westwood only saw one new case of COVID-19 on Saturday.    Most students who lived on the Hill have already moved off campus after UCLA transitioned spring quarter instruction online.    The county recorded 339 new cases of coronavirus Saturday, bringing the total to 1,804. The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care in California also more than doubled from 200 to 410  ,   Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a press conference Saturday.

They must remain closed until March 31 unless the executive order is rescinded or extended. The move is an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19, Garcetti said.    LA County had 69 cases of COVID-19 as of Sunday, including one death.    The executive order, signed Sunday night,   likewise closes entertainment facilities, such as movie theaters, playhouses and gyms. Garcetti strongly urged all places of worship to limit their services at a press conference Sunday night.    Businesses with delivery or pickup services, such as restaurants with drive-throughs or takeout options, may continue to operate those services, he said.    Grocery stores, pharmacies and food banks will stay open, Garcetti said.    While some restaurants in Westwood are switching to delivery and takeout, at least one is closing down entirely.    Roccos Tavern is closing its locations at UCLA and USC for the time being.    Our business is down to literally nothing, said Alexander Manos, one of the owners of Roccos. We're not waiting for the kids to come back (to) Westwood. We're just waiting for the city to say, Hey, you can just reopen as a restaurant again.    Manos said his restaurant group is seeking small business aid from the city in the meantime to keep the taverns afloat through the closures. Its remaining stores will be transitioning to takeout and delivery only, moving back into pizza.    We started out as a pizza shop, Manos said. We're putting together a grassroots campaign to get back into pizza delivery, pizza pickup, wings and all. All the favorites of Rocco's so we can stay in business.    Ezequiel Medina, a night manager at Enzos Pizzeria in Westwood, was working at the restaurant when he learned of the executive order.    Before the mayors announcement, Medina said his restaurant has also been receiving fewer customers after UCLA classes moved online as a response to the pandemic.    A lot of the students are leaving (for home), Medina said.    After the executive order was announced, Medina said the restaurant will stop dine-in orders but will continue with takeout and deliveries.    We'll just leave (the dine-in area) open but will just let the public know that it will be either pickups or deliveries on our website, Medina said.    David Houston, the owner of Barneys Beanery in Westwood, said the pub will comply with the order and temporarily close.    The most important thing, of course, is safety for our staff and our customers, Houston said. Were not happy, but were going to comply and we hope this thing can get over quickly and we all get back to our normal lives.    The gastropub had posted a sign on its doors before the executive   order denoting that parts of the dine-in area were closed, cutting seating in half, and notifying customers that the store takes to-go and delivery orders.    Broxton Brewery in Westwood declined to comment.    Garcetti also discussed other measures the city is taking to lessen the impact of the virus and prevent its spread.    LA is opening 60 centers Wednesday that will offer food to students and parents, Garcetti said.    The city has already ordered that water and power not be shut off if people cant pay their bills, Garcetti said. The city likewise ordered a moratorium on renters being evicted.    Garcetti also asked Los Angeles residents not to hoard food.    According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, large gatherings are the most common reason for the spread of the novel coronavirus. The CDC recommended Saturday morning that citizens   postpone or cancel gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks.    Slowing the rate of COVID-19 infections will ensure that the health care industry is not too overwhelmed to care for people who have other ailments, Garcetti said.    The most important thing LA residents can do is continue social distancing to protect older and immunocompromised citizens, Garcetti said.    Myself and all of us know of individuals who are saying, This doesnt apply to me. Im going to get through this, he said. Im strong, Im healthy, maybe Im young, its not going to statistically take me. But know that our actions arent about ourselves.    Will Hollister, a first-year civil engineering student, lives in Hermosa Beach, in LA County. He said the executive order will affect him, but hell figure it out.    I thought it was a good precaution, he said. Like you've kind of seen what's been going on with Italy. They're kind of screwing that up. Obviously it seems like a lot, but it should save a lot of people.    Roccos has been in business for 20 years, Manos said.    We've never come across anything like this in our lives, he said.

The Senate Undergraduate Council also voted to extend the deadline for changing the grading basis for classes until the end of week 10, said Michael Meranze, chair of the Academic Senate, in an email to students Thursday. Classes taken on a Pass/No Pass basis do not provide letter grades, and therefore do not affect GPA.    The council and the Graduate Council also recommended that UCLA drop any fees associated with dropping a class or changing the grading basis for a class after the end of week 2.    Meranze warned students to check whether or not a class offers a Pass/No Pass option. Students should also check with advisors and about changing major classes since Pass/No Pass classes will still not fulfil some major requirements, as well as with financial aid requirements, he said.    The Graduate Council of the Senate also voted to give departments, Interdepartmental Degree Programs and schools the authority to decide whether graduate students can take more than one class on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis.    Additionally, if graduate departments do allow students to take more than one class on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis, the department must accept the classes toward degree requirements.    The Undergraduate Students Association Council recommended a default universal Pass/No Record grading system to the Academic Senate and administrators Tuesday, a recommendation that was both echoed and opposed by students during the public comment section of the councils meeting.    This isnt the first change the Senate has made to academic policy in order to manage the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. The senate previously voted to change finals regulations after UCLA moved classes and final exams online wherever possible for the end of winter quarter.    Since then, UCLA has also suspended all nonessential gatherings or meetings on campus and encouraged students to move off the Hill.    Over 80%    of students on the Hill have moved out as of Tuesday, with more expected to follow.

The newly hired coach met with the then-high school junior guard in April 2019 before he reclassified and committed to Kentucky. But after a 28-game stint with the Wildcats, Juzang announced his intentions to transfer, and Cronin pounced.  ""When I heard he was headed for the transfer portal, we all had time, so it gave me some time to watch some Kentucky games,"" Cronin said. ""The way I look at it is he had his senior year of high school at Kentucky against NBA players.""  Cronin and UCLA men's basketball made their last two additions to their 2020 recruiting class official when Juzang and guard Jaylen Clark signed their national letters of intent on Wednesday. The two join five-star guard Daishen Nix, who signed with the Bruins on Nov. 13, to make up the Pac-12's fourth-ranked unit.  While the trio only come in at the No. 41 spot nationally, Cronin still managed to haul in three four- or- five-star recruits  something he did just once in his 13 years at Cincinnati. Cronin said recruiting will always be the toughest part of his job no matter where he is, but the academic and on-court prestige at his disposal at UCLA certainly gives him a new advantage.  ""At UCLA, our reputation precedes itself academically  that is a plus,"" Cronin said. ""That, obviously, and our tremendous tradition, and then Westwood's probably  I would say  arguably the best college campus in the world.""  Another advantage Cronin didn't have with the Bearcats was boasting one of the country's top basketball hotbeds in his backyard.  Both Clark and Juzang are local products, with Clark playing his high school ball at Etiwanda High School in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and Juzang suiting up for Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles.  When Cronin was recruiting Juzang over FaceTime last week, the two discovered they lived just 3.2 miles away from each other.  ""We could've walked and met in the middle,"" Cronin said. ""I've been going for two-hour walks every day. I could've easily just walked over to his house.""  Juzang averaged 2.9 points per game with Kentucky, but he scored in double-digits twice in his final nine contests. In his third and final year of high school competition, Juzang averaged 23 points per game en route to winning Mission League MVP.  Clark  the No. 21 shooting guard in the country and No. 14 recruit in California  averaged 17-plus points per game in each of his last three seasons.  ""I think he's a perfect fit for me  he's a tough guy, he's a hard worker, he's a winner, he can play all over the floor,"" Cronin said. ""Just very fortunate it all worked out with (Clark) because I think he and I were made for each other as coach and player.""  Cronin's wing rotation will lose redshirt senior guard Prince Ali to graduation and could lose junior guard Chris Smith to the NBA Draft. However, the Bruins are projected to return nearly 70% of their scoring next year after only retaining 47.6% of their scoring last offseason.  Despite the bulk of their offensive production coming back, Cronin said there's no harm in adding some more.  ""We went on a magical run, but let's not call us an offensive juggernaut by any means,"" Cronin said. ""There's nothing better  as a coach  than having options and being able to press, being able to have depth, being able to have multiple guys who can put the ball in the basket.""",['cap-sam-connon'],"['mens-basketball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.sp_.unconnon.ADX_-1.jpg

Students moved off the Hill in droves in response to UCLAs decision to move spring quarter  online . The shift to online, prompted by the spread of COVID-19 across California, came with campus officials urging students to leave on-campus housing if it was safe for them to do so. Students were also told they could seek refunds if they chose to leave the Hill early.  The university got hit hard by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, said Josh OConnor, assistant director of leadership and involvement for Residential Life, who spoke at the Undergraduate Students Association Council special meeting Tuesday.  The Hill is in the process of refunding students, which will take a couple of weeks, OConnor said.  Students who have left their dorms but left items in their rooms can call  UCLA Housing  to cancel their contract but will have to set up a way to remove items from their room.  UCLA plans to continue using on-campus housing primarily for students, including those who should be isolated, said Michael Deluca, assistant vice chancellor of student affairs.  UCLA has been working with the state and Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center to  provide space for patients  in case the medical center reaches capacity, Deluca said.

UCLA has chosen Boston College Athletics Director Martin Jarmond to take over as its next director of athletics when Dan Guerreros contract expires July 1, Yahoo Sports reported Saturday. Jarmond who became the youngest athletics director at a Power Five school when he was hired at the age of 37 in June 2017  will be the first African American athletics director to lead UCLA Athletics.    UCLA is set to announce the hiring Monday and will introduce him virtually later in the week, according to the Los Angeles Times.    Guerreros contract initially ran until Dec. 31, 2019, but the UC Regents voted to give him a six-month extension in September. Guerrero announced Sept. 19 that    he would retire    at the end of his contract, and UCLAs search for his successor has come to an end 240 days later.    The LA Times reported Chancellor Gene Block, Emily A. Carter, executive vice chancellor and provost, and Yolanda Gorman, senior advisor to the chancellor for strategic initiatives, led the decision-making process.    Jarmond signed a six-year contract that will pay him $1.2 million in his first year and top out at $1.7 million in his final year.    According to multiple outlets, UCLAs final candidates were Jarmond, Virginias Carla Williams and Penns M. Grace Calhoun. UNLV Athletics Director Desiree Reed-Francois was another finalist for the job, but she reportedly removed her name from the race Friday morning.    The Bruins won 32 NCAA championships in Guerreros 18 years leading the department, while the Eagles were titleless during Jarmonds three-year tenure.    Boston College mens basketball made the postseason for the first time since 2011 during Jarmonds first year in town, while both the mens and womens hockey teams won conference titles. The closest Jarmond got to winning a national championship in his three years was when the Eagles womens lacrosse team made the finals in 2018.    Jarmond made three head coaching hires at Boston College womens basketball, womens volleyball and football. Former Ohio State co-defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley was Jarmonds pick to head up the football team, a hire that earned him praise from    Sports Illustrated   ,    247Sports    and more.    But before Jarmond took the job in Chestnut Hill  ,   Massachusetts, he spent more than a decade collecting trophies in the Big 10.    After Jarmond played four years for UNC Wilmington mens basketball and earned an MBA and masters in sports administration from Ohio University, he joined the Michigan State Athletics department in 2003, becoming an assistant athletics director in 2006. Over the next six years, the Spartans won the national title in mens hockey, made two Final Fours in mens basketball, hired eventual two-time Big Ten football coach of the year Mark Dantonio and made the national championship game in womens basketball.    Jarmond spent the next eight years at Ohio State, where he served as associate director of athletics, chief of staff and deputy director of athletics. The Buckeyes won nine NCAA championships during Jarmonds tenure, including the 2014 College Football Playoff.    One of Jarmonds key roles at Ohio State was as a director for coaching search committees, with his most notable hire being football coach   Urban Meyer in 2012. Jarmond was a member of the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship Advisory Group while he was in Columbus, Ohio, and he also served on the Rose Bowl Advisory Committee.    Ohio State won the 2010 Rose Bowl in Jarmonds first year on the Buckeyes staff, while the Bruins have yet to do so since 1986.    It still remains to be seen which UCLA teams if any will take the field in the fall, but it now falls on Jarmonds shoulders to decide how the athletic department will handle the COVID-19 pandemic, the $19 million deficit it ran in 2019 and the continued aftermath of the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal.

Three UCLA students in off-campus self-isolation    tested negative    for the disease March 6. Block himself has been in self-isolation since    Friday    after coming into contact with someone who carried the virus.

The UC estimates that, in March, unanticipated expenses and lost revenue cost the University system a minimum of $310 million when excluding costs incurred by medical centers, said UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook in an emailed statement.  The shift to online platforms for instruction, setting up cybersecurity infrastructure, issuing housing and dining refunds, and additional cleaning measures and student health services have contributed to the new financial burden.  Increased costs also came from testing and caring for COVID-19 patients at the UCs five medical centers, Holbrook added.  The UC is seeking government assistance for the shortfall in funding, but the promised help is far from sufficient, Holbrook said.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which Congress passed in late March, will provide economic relief for businesses and organizations enduring new financial hardship because of the pandemic. Over $220 million has been  allocated  to the UC campuses.  From the federal government, the CARES Act will provide some much-needed relief for which the University is grateful, but the direct assistance that UC campuses will receive will not be sufficient to cover even the first month of our COVID-19 response, Holbrook said.  The UC is also working with the state and holding out hope that extensive budget-increase requests will be approved, he said. The outcome still remains unclear, but the UC has confirmed that no changes will be made to tuition costs until more definitive answers regarding the budget are provided by the state.  UCLA has encountered similar difficulties due to the sharp decline in revenue from coronavirus-related changes, said UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez in an emailed statement.  UCLA is seeing revenue losses due to the cancellation of housing and dining contracts, academic conferences, and athletic and cultural events, Vazquez said.  UCLAs conversion to online instruction has resulted in massive costs for systemwide technology upgrades, he added. Although UCLA is hopeful that the state will provide the needed budget increases, the outlook is uncertain, Vazquez said.  Aidan Arasasingham, government relations committee chair of the UC Student Association, wrote in an email that he believes that these crushing costs are a necessary burden the UC must carry in order to continue to best help its students during this time.  In shutting down campuses, UC refunded housing contracts yet is still keeping housing and dining open for students in need, wrote Arasasingham, a third-year global studies student. UC is honoring contracts for all employees until the end of the academic year. UC is retraining and retaining service workers to support UC Health in battling the spread of this disease.  When considering the alternative to paying these costs, such as layoffs, service reductions and shutdowns, Arasasingham said he considers the UCs current course of action to be the best one possible given the circumstances.  If the pandemic continues into the fall, Arasasingham said he believes that state assistance is imperative to keep tuition costs consistent. Increasing tuition costs will place an even greater burden on students already financially struggling, he added.  Going into the fall, the UC must commit to keeping tuition flat and lowering student costs during this global pandemic, Arasasingham said. Students were struggling with financial, housing, and food insecurity even before this crisis. Those needs have only been worsened as a result of this pandemic.  All UC campuses have transitioned to online instruction for the remainder of the school year, encouraging students to cancel their housing contracts and finish the quarter from home.

The absence or reduction of campus programs and entities along with the switch to virtual learning has prompted some students to call for a partial refund for the cost of attendance.  A Change.org  petition  with over 43,000 signatures is demanding the University of California provide at least a partial refund for spring tuition, arguing that the majority of students have returned home and are no longer able to benefit from campus services.  The student learning experience has considerably changed due to the move to online learning. Students have had to adapt to virtual learning platforms such as Zoom, while no longer being able to enjoy the benefits of an in-person education. UCLA made the decision to move classes online on March 13, to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus on campus.   [Related link:    Professors reorganize, students adjust to first week of online classes   ]   Since the start of the quarter, UCLA has also closed all libraries, the Wooden Center, the Ackerman Student Union and a variety of other programs and services formerly available.  Services such as the Wooden Center and the Student Union are funded through UCLA campus-specific fees, while other programs such as Counseling and Psychological Services are funded by UC-wide student services fees.  However, the University of California has repeatedly said that it does not intend to offer any refund for tuition, citing the continued costs of administration and maintenance on UC campuses.  In many areas the University faces increased costs, not lower costs, due to the pandemic, UC spokesperson Sarah McBride said in an emailed statement.  McBride said increased costs include expenditures on video collaboration, software and website licenses. These licenses are necessary to support large-scale video conferencing for classes on platforms such as Zoom.  McBride added that funds are also going towards technology security to support a remote workforce in the UC system. For instance, the UC is paying for additional private networks to ensure security and privacy, and providing laptops for individuals who do not ordinarily work remotely.  Robert Watson, president of the Undergraduate Students Association Council, said he understands the UC is facing added costs because of the move to remote instruction.  However, Watson said he is dissatisfied with the lack of student input in the UC Regents and the UCOP decision to not offer a partial refund.  Watson said UC leadership did not consult with either the University of California Students Association nor the council of student body presidents, of which he is a member, before making the announcement about tuition in March.  Theres a longstanding problem in the UC with folks making decisions that really impact students without students being present, Watson said. This should be communicated to everyone. We have the council of student body presidents (and) we have UCSA. The UCOP should be consulting with both of those entities before making really big decisions.  The UCOP did not respond to a request for comment on its alleged lack of transparency in deciding against a partial refund.  While on-campus services at UCLA such as the Wooden Center, Ackerman Student Union, and the libraries had been closed, UCLA still requires a significant amount of funding to pay for the continued maintenance of these facilities along with the salaries of campus staff, Watson said.  Even though students arent using these services, the costs are still there, Watson said. If you take away the money from the fees, youre putting peoples jobs at risk.  USAC Financial Supports Commissioner Millen Srivastava, agreed with Watson that the UC had not been transparent in its decision to not offer a partial refund.  Srivastava added that more effective communication was needed between the UC, campus administrations and students.  Theres a whole line of confusion which is just causing more chaos, she said.  Srivastava said students are often unaware of many of the behind-the-scenes costs of running a university, such as maintenance and staff salaries, but added that the UC owes students greater transparency around where specifically tuition and systemwide fees are being spent during the coronavirus pandemic.  USAC leadership, which includes Srivastava, will meet with UCLAs chief financial officer Greg Goldman later this month to obtain a thorough transparency report documenting where exactly tuition and fees are being spent, Srivastava said.  Srivastava said the focus of this meeting would be to find where tuition was being spent, particularly for international and out-of-state students who pay higher tuition than in-state students.  Out-of-state and international students are paying $15,000 (for spring quarter) for a university that theyre going to at home right now, she said.  Srivastava added that a transparency report would help assuage the concerns of such students about how their money is being allocated.  To provide support for students who have been financially harmed by the coronavirus pandemic, USAC launched a relief fund on April 18 where students can apply for a one-time relief payment of $500.  All undergraduate students can apply for the fund by  filling out a questionnaire , answering questions about how they have been affected by the outbreak.  Srivastava said the relief fund was made possible by USACs surplus for the spring quarter, as a result of having fewer expenses due to the move to remote instruction.",['cap-stephen-wyer'],"['campus', 'news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.news_.ucstudentfees.KM_.jpg

Now, hes coming home to trade in blue and white for blue and gold.  Juzang is transferring from Kentucky to UCLA mens basketball, he announced Thursday on Twitter. The 6-foot-6 guard was raised in Los Angeles and was a four-star recruit coming out of Harvard-Westlake School in 2019.  Juzang said he will be pursuing a waiver from the NCAA for immediate eligibility, but his status for next season is still to be determined.  The Bruins pursued Juzang out of high school when former coach Steve Alford was still at the helm, as they hosted him on an unofficial visit Aug. 18, 2016, and made him a scholarship offer July 19, 2017. Juzang entered the transfer portal March 27, naming UCLA, Arizona, Oregon, Notre Dame, Texas Tech and Villanova as his top six destinations.  Thinking about competing for a national title for the hometown team under coach (Mick) Cronin is something that genuinely motivates me and wants me to get after it, so Im super excited, Juzang told the Los Angeles Times.  With the coronavirus outbreak keeping Juzang and others at home, he was unable to take visits to the other five schools. Juzang said in his announcement tweet spending time at home during quarantine has changed his priorities, as the wing grew up just 15 minutes outside of Westwood.  Juzang played in 28 games for Kentucky his freshman season, averaging 2.9 points and 1.9 rebounds in 12.4 minutes per game and two starts.  Juzang notched a career-high 13 points on 4-of-4 shooting from the field and 3-of-3 from behind the arc on the road against Tennessee on Feb. 8. In his final outing with Kentucky, Juzang scored 10 points in 33 minutes against Florida.  The Los Angeles native shot 37.7% from the field and 32.6% from deep in his lone season with the Wildcats.  Juzang played just three years in high school, as he reclassified to the class of 2019 last April. In his 74-game career with Harvard-Westlake, Juzang averaged 19.9 points and 8.4 rebounds per game while shooting 44% from the field, 35% from long range and 80% on free throws.  ""Being able to score at a high level, I see myself as an all-around basketball player,"" Juzang said in an interview with 247Sports. ""Scoring is one of the best things I do. The year at Kentucky was great for me and how they developed me and how I learned there.""  Despite shooting 4.2 free throws per game in high school, Juzang averaged just 0.4 attempts per game from the charity stripe with Kentucky.  Juzangs commitment comes two days after junior guard Chris Smith entered the 2020 NBA Draft, and the Bruins roster flexibility is starting to vanish.  With the scholarships from guard Prince Ali, forward Alex Olesinski and forward Shareef ONeal coming off the books, UCLA had room for three new players regardless of Smiths decision. Between Juzang and incoming freshmen guards Daishen Nix and Jaylen Clark, the Bruins will need Smith to commit to the NBA for good if they want to bring in one last transfer or recruit.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['mens-basketball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/020UKvsOleMissMBB2020.jpg

The students are suing for a reduction of on-campus services because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but will not sue for the cost of tuition or housing.    University of Californias decision to transition to online classes and to instruct students to leave campus were responsible decisions to make, but it is unfair and unlawful for University of California to retain fees and costs and to pass the losses on to the students and/or their families, the lawsuit states.    The suit was filed on behalf of Claire Brandmeyer, a UC Davis student who left campus in mid-March.    The students are suing for refunds of student fees such as the $1,128 UC-wide Student Services Fee paid by UC students, as well as other campus-specific fees.    UC officials said in late April the University would not refund student fees or tuition, stating the University saw increased costs in many areas because of the pandemic, particularly for technology to support remote instruction.    Since UCLAs announcement to move instruction online in early March, it has shut down campus facilities such as    UCLA Recreation   , libraries and athletic events.

The protesters gathered despite social media announcements that the protest had been canceled. They chanted Black lives matter, and Dont shoot, on sidewalks near the Wilshire Federal Building in Westwood.    The demonstrators criticized police brutality amid several days of protests across Los Angeles and the nation following George Floyds death in the custody of Minneapolis police May 25.    [Related link:    Protests erupt in Los Angeles in response to death of George Floyd   ]    The Student Activist Project at UCLA originally planned the Westwood protest for June 1, but canceled it Sunday evening for a number of reasons, including safety concerns.    Two police agencies and the California National Guard deployed over 100 police officers and troops in response to the Westwood protest. The UCPD, LAPD and the National Guard deployed at least 20 cars and armored vehicles. The UCPD branch at UC Irvine also deployed ten officers to Westwood at UCLAs request, said UCI spokesperson Tom Vasich.    Dozens of the protesters later moved to the 405 Freeway ramp, temporarily blocking northbound traffic. The police then began firing rubber bullets at the crowd and detained at least 10 people.    After ordering protesters to move onto Wilshire Boulevard, the police formed a blockade of the street. They then declared the protest an unlawful assembly and ordered gatherers to leave the area.    Conor Driscoll, one of the protesters, said cars driving by the Westwood protest honked in support of the protesters.    Almost everyone was honking and raising their fists with us, said Driscoll, a second-year international development studies student. They were honking to the rhythm of Black Lives Matter trying to chant with us. A lot of people had their own signs with their passengers.&nbsp;   &nbsp; https://twitter.com/dailybruin/status/1267579528412409857?s=20   Gianni Eason, another student protester, said law enforcement officials only focused on protecting private property, instead of demonstrating concern for the public.    Its hurtful and painful to see they only care about the property, said Eason, a third-year political science student. I wish there was the same response when we were being murdered.    The UCLA Store closed 1 p.m. Monday in anticipation of the protests. Several other stores in Westwood, including Ralphs, Trader Joes and Target also closed. Around half the stores in Westwood Village barricaded their storefronts Monday, including Target, CVS and LA Fitness.&nbsp;    SAP at UCLAs initial planning for the protest did not include input from the Afrikan Student Union, said ASU Chair Alexandria Davis, in an emailed statement. The organizers also did not include input from the Black Graduate Student Association, said BGSA President Trisden Shaw.&nbsp;    The ASU and BGSA did not endorse the protest because they were not directly involved in the planning and for safety reasons, Davis and Shaw said.&nbsp;    Im very wary of organizations that are not black-led or black-centered that are taking this moment to be active without working with black organizations, Shaw said. To me that is not really allyship; allyship is the process of supporting movements and the plans and organizations and programming that is led by them.    Davis said the nationwide protests demonstrate there has been no progress on police brutality issues.&nbsp;    The police system is not just filled with rotten apples; instead it is a rotten tree with roots of anti-Blackness, racism, and enslavement, Davis said in an emailed statement.&nbsp;    Westwood city officials said they support peaceful and lawful protests, but city businesses are concerned about possible looting in Westwood Village, said Lisa Chapman, the Westwood Neighborhood Council president.  &nbsp;    Andrew Thomas, executive director of the Westwood Village Improvement Association, said he does not anticipate the barricades being removed in the next few days.&nbsp;    The National Guard should not be used against peaceful protesters, said Michael Skiles, the North Westwood Neighborhood Council president. Police should put down their helmets and batons and join protesters in the community, Skiles added.    The Undergraduate Students Association Council circulated a petition to the state governor and city mayor, calling for the removal of National Guard troops from Westwood.    California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    [Related link:    USAC leadership requests immediate removal of National Guard from UCLA area   ]    In a press conference addressing Mondays protests, Garcetti said a    county-wide curfew    would begin at 6 p.m.&nbsp;    ASU started an online petition calling on UCLA to either cancel or postpone spring quarter finals due to tensions and stress caused by the circumstances surrounding the nationwide protests, in addition to the coronavirus outbreak. The petition has over 10,000 signatures, Davis said.   The UCLA Academic Senate agreed to recommend professors make adjustments to spring quarter finals, according to a  statement  by USAC and ASU student leaders. However, the Academic Senate does not have the authority to outright cancel or postpone all final exams due to UC-wide rules, the statement read.   UCLA is working to create virtual reflection spaces for concerned students, according to an online    statement    by Chancellor Gene Block and other UCLA officials and student leaders.&nbsp;    However, UCLA is not doing enough to address the challenges facing black students, Shaw said. The university has not approved requests for funding and a director for a black resource center on campus, he added.&nbsp;    For (UCLA) to say black lives matter, well, we know that, Shaw said.

The program aims to provide subsidies of a maximum of $1,000 per month for up to three months for families whose income is impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The details of the program and final amount will depend on how much more federal funding is allocated to states.   The United States federal government passed emergency legislation, the CARES Act, in March to help those affected by the pandemic, allocating money for state and local governments to address the crisis.   The county&#8217;s action is one of several efforts passed by California state and local governments aiming to protect renters since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11.  But renters and landlords in Westwood are still facing difficulty navigating the new regulations.  Michael Skiles, president of the North Westwood Neighborhood Council, said landlords in his constituency are concerned about paying mortgages without rent. Not all landlords are truly wealthy, Skiles added.  &#8220;Oftentimes you have a retiree who has put their whole life savings into buying a building, and they're counting on rent from that building as income to support themselves,&#8221; Skiles said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t just shift the devastation from one party to another party.&#8221;  Skiles said landlords have requested that the NWWNC not advocate for more expansive government measures like a &#8220;rent holiday,&#8221; but added that it is hard for the council to even reach a consensus on the topic because the city of Los Angeles forbade all neighborhood councils from meeting as a result of the coronavirus.  Andrew Thomas, executive director of the Westwood Village Improvement Association, said some commercial landlords in his business improvement district are trying to handle rent on an individual basis, alongside government regulations.  &#8220;Those relationships, especially with the mom and pop businesses, they&#8217;re personal,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;This is just their lives, it's how they care for their families and I think our property owners are sensitive to that, but yet they have their businesses too.&#8221;  Westwood had vacancies before the pandemic, and will have more after, Thomas said. However, he said he hopes the business community will work together to rebound.  &#8220;We&#8217;re not sure what the economy is going to look like when we finally do roll out into some form of recovery, but my feeling is it's a lot better to have a tenant in your property than not,&#8221;  Thomas said. &#8220;I have a feeling all this is going to be done on sort of a case-by-case basis between the tenants and the landlords trying to negotiate some type of framework.&#8221;  While some landlords reached out to help tenants before official government regulations were enacted, others have tried bypassing the law, said Faizah Malik, a staff attorney for community development at Public Counsel, the largest pro bono law firm in the United States.  &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen landlords trying to circumvent the law,&#8221; Malik said. &#8220;For example, some are telling tenants when the crisis is over rent is due immediately and that's not true. Or trying to pressure tenants into signing things that they don't need to sign right now.&#8221;  On March 30, the Los Angeles City Council extended the rent repayment period from six to 12 months after the expiration of the local emergency. There is currently no official government procedure for agreements about repayment.   Silvana Naguib, supervising staff attorney for homelessness prevention at Public Counsel, said if renters have questions about what their protections are during the emergency, they first need to determine what jurisdiction they are in. There are multiple sources of governmental authority acting on an individual, from the city council to the sheriff to the state legislature, and each jurisdiction has its own guidelines, Naguib said.  Naguib and Malik advised tenants to notify their landlord immediately if they cannot pay rent because of a coronavirus-related reason and to keep all documentation verifying that claim. But they recommend that if tenants can pay rent, they should do it.  &#8220;Pay your rent if you can,&#8221; Naguib said. &#8220;Every jurisdiction that has any kind of protection, you still have an obligation to pay. If you can pay, you should still pay.&#8221;  When UCLA moved spring quarter classes online, many students left their on-campus housing while others may have been stuck with their off-campus apartments, forcing students to take different approaches to rent during the pandemic.  Athena Amarantos, a second-year French and pre-economics student, chose to move back home with her family in the LA area. Her university-owned housing offered a full refund for spring quarter.  &#8220;I know so many people (who) are being forced to stay in LA because they can&#8217;t get out of their leases and they aren't allowed to sublet their apartments right now,&#8221; Amarantos said. &#8220;For me, they sent out a link, and all I had to do was fill out a form that said &#8216;I want to move out on this day,&#8217; submit.&#8221;  Maggie Pong, a third-year French student, said she is one of the students struggling to sublet her apartment, but still chose to move back to China to be with her parents.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to rent it out to someone else, but so many students are transferring out of their apartments because of the same issue so it's really hard to just rent out an apartment, especially in Westwood because it&#8217;s so expensive,&#8221; Pong said.  In addition to short-term challenges paying rent, Naguib and Malik said the long-term ramifications of this crisis may take years to unravel.

That's not a slight on his game  the UCLA men's basketball junior won Pac-12 Most Improved Player of the Year and earned a spot on the First Team All-Pac-12 this season. Looking at where the guard was even a year ago, that's a major leap and one that certainly warrants praise.  But that doesn't mean NBA teams are going to bite  at least, not yet.  Smith took the first step toward the pros when he declared for the 2020 NBA Draft on April 7. Between his athleticism, versatility and length, he is certainly an intriguing prospect. Add in his improved shooting, rebounding and defensive abilities he picked up under coach Mick Cronin, and he may just have a potential NBA career in his future.  That doesn't mean now is the time for him to start it, however, and he can just take a look around at his former teammates to recognize that.  Smith played two seasons alongside guard/forward Kris Wilkes, who averaged 15.5 points per game in his two seasons with UCLA. Smith and Wilkes measure in at 6-foot-9 and 6-foot-8, respectively, and they both weigh 215 pounds.  Wilkes entered the NBA Draft pool after his freshman season  in which he averaged 13.7 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game on 51% shooting from 2 and 35.2% from 3  only to back out and return to Westwood for another year. Smith averaged 13.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game on 50.7% shooting from 2 and 34.1% from 3 this past season.  Wilkes was only a freshman when he put up those numbers, so it's not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. However, if Wilkes got the advice to return to school in 2018, it'd be hard to imagine Smith gets told any different over the next few months.  Even when Wilkes bumped up his scoring and usage numbers his sophomore season, he still wound up going undrafted in 2019. After missing the NBA Summer League as a result of illness, Wilkes went the entire 2019-2020 season without a pro contract.  Nothing is a sure thing in the NBA Draft, with only 60 players getting the chance to hear their names called while the rest are left to fight for scraps.  Considering two of the three Bruins who left early last season went undrafted, Smith's prospects don't look great in 2020. Bleacher Report doesn't have him ranked in its top-50 prospects, while ESPN has him slotted in at No. 72 and the Athletic pegged him at No. 99.  Smith's stats, rankings and pro prospects parallel the situation another former teammate of his, Thomas Welsh, faced in 2017.  The then-junior center averaged 10.8 points and 8.7 rebounds per game as a starter on a Sweet 16 team in 2016-2017. He wasn't much of a shooter, but he was a solid big man who could have thrived in an early-2000s NBA, so he declared for the draft that April.  Welsh ultimately decided to return for his senior year at UCLA, and he wound up averaging 12.6 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in his final season. And despite the fact he had only taken one 3-pointer in his 99-game career up until that point, Welsh shot 40.2% from deep on 112 attempts during his final year in Westwood.  His ability to diversify his game while simultaneously improving his go-to traits was enough to lift Welsh into the second round, as he was selected No. 58 overall by the Denver Nuggets in 2018. It's difficult to see Smith becoming a 40% 3-point shooter next year, but the same could have been said about Welsh.  Smith has seen his per game and efficiency numbers go up drastically from season to season, and there's no reason to think that he's hit his peak either. He had a good season  based on the fact he made First Team All-Pac-12, he was a top-10 player in the conference.  But if that's what he can do at age 20 in his first year as a full starter under a brand new coach, imagine what he could do next season. Smith could flirt with 18 points per game and prove himself a candidate for Pac-12 Men's Basketball Player of the Year with Oregon's Payton Pritchard, Washington's Isaiah Stewart and almost the entire first team heading for the pros.  It's hard to fault Smith for aiming high  there isn't anyone on campus that's actively rooting against his NBA career. There's nothing wrong with betting on yourself, but the bet still has to be a smart one.  Looking at Wilkes as a cautionary tale and Welsh as a guide, Smith's decision should be simple.  If he wants to maximize his potential and draft stock, coming back for his senior year seems like the obvious choice.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['mens-basketball', 'sports', 'sports-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/hz.sp_.mbb_.nbk_.DB_.jpg

We know (the order is) effective, but we still have a ways to go in order to both protect the lives of people who live in our county and to make sure that our healthcare system remains fully able to service all who need their care, said Barbara Ferrer, director of the LA County Department of Public Health, at the countys daily press briefing.   LA mayor Eric Garcetti announced Friday that the city of Los Angeles will also extend its safer at home order to May 15.   The extension of the order will be accompanied by a couple of new measures, including a measure requiring LA County residents to wear face coverings in public beginning at midnight on April 15.    Garcetti    announced    a similar order Tuesday requiring that all Angelenos working or shopping in nonmedical essential businesses wear cloth face coverings. Garcettis order went into effect Friday.    Ferrer said the county is seeing a slowing in the spread of cases due to the safer at home order.

Student leaders &#8212; led by the Undergraduate Students Association Council and the USAC Office of the External Vice President &#8212; are requesting that California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti remove the National Guard troops from Westwood. Garcetti requested 1,000 National Guard troops be sent to Los Angeles on Sunday in response to city-wide protests against police brutality.  Their request comes after multiple students confirmed the presence of National Guard troops at the intersection of Strathmore Drive and Levering Avenue around 8 p.m. on Sunday.  The EVP office plans to start a social media movement using the hashtags #NationalGuardOut and #DemilitarizeWestwood and is sending a letter to the governor&#8217;s and mayor&#8217;s offices, said Aidan Arasasingham, the 2020-2021 USAC EVP.   Their  letter  requests the immediate withdrawal of the National Guard from Westwood, stating their presence incites fear and concern in UCLA students.  The request comes amid a protest in Westwood, which, although canceled by the organizers, attracted dozens of protesters. The National Guard stationed several vehicles near the protest.  The office also released a petition for the removal of the national guard, which has since gotten over 1,000 signatures, Arasasingham said.  &#8220;It's raising the important conversation about the militarization of the communities around UCLA and Los Angeles at a time when increased police and military presence is the opposite of what should be going on,&#8221; Arasasingham said.   [Related link:    Protests erupt in Los Angeles in response to death of George Floyd   ]   Arasasingham said the presence of National Guard troops will disproportionately affect black students and black communities in LA, serving to only exacerbate feelings of unsafety among these groups.  LAPD Chief of Police Michel Moore said at a press conference Sunday that National Guard troops would be stationed near individual businesses and would not be patrolling neighborhoods.  A spokesperson for the LAPD declined to comment.  UCLA sent an email to students Sunday condemning George Floyd&#8217;s death, signed by many administrators including Chancellor Gene Block and Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck.  Arasasingham said he appreciated the administration&#8217;s email, but added it was the bare minimum.  &#8220;For any kind of actual action to be taken, it needs to be done through listening to and being transparent with and being held accountable by black student leaders at UCLA,&#8221; he said.

But earlier this week, the UCLA baseball stadium named in his memory became a Los Angeles Police Department detention center for protesters participating in the Black Lives Matter movement.    On Monday, the LAPD  detained protesters  in inhumane conditions for multiple hours in the stadiums parking lot. UCLA does not have immediate jurisdiction over the grounds. However, the universitys image is still intrinsically tied to the property.&nbsp;    Testimony from detainees and witnesses said LAPD left dozens of protesters in cages on buses for hours, deprived of food, water and restrooms. LAPD didnt just break its promise to protect and serve, it committed human rights violations.    Since then, the university has released    a statement    that it was troubled to hear of the situation and that LAPD used the stadium grounds to detain protesters   without its permission. UCLAs statement also said LAPD was notified further use of the stadium for detainment would not be permitted.    But they shouldnt just be troubled  they should be outraged.    Whether or not UCLA knew of the situation is beside the point.   These circumstances speak to the larger environment of police brutality against Black people across LA  and about UCLAs unwillingness to act against it.&nbsp;    Now, administrators response revolves around their own reputation, instead of condemning the heinous actions taken by the LAPD at a UCLA facility. The university has repeatedly said Black Lives Matter, but its unwillingness to stand up to injustice and brutality of the LAPD in the past week says more than a tweet from Chancellor Gene Block ever could  not that those ever said much.&nbsp;    To be clear, the LAPD is unequivocally to blame for its blatant disregard for the right to assembly and humane treatment in police custody.    But with seemingly no response from campus administration,   students have had to take matters into their own hands by protesting, donating and organizing.&nbsp;    The Afrikan Student Union    submitted    a letter to the UCLA Academic Senate, calling to modify finals because of mental health concerns among the Black student community. FEM has    pledged    to donate over $750 to aid relief efforts in Minneapolis.&nbsp;    Meanwhile,    protests are erupting in UCLAs neighborhood    and students are being arrested for peaceful demonstration  yet the most solidarity the university has shown beyond an emailed statement is some social media outreach. It has yet to provide any communication or resources for students trying to engage in protesting or otherwise contribute to the movement.    What UCLA fails to understand, beyond its insipid public relations efforts, is that its unwillingness to condemn the LAPDs actions harms Black students. The administrations silence favors the oppressor and delegitimizes its lone    statement    in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.    And as UCLA fails to deliver an adequate response, students must deal with varying responses from professors.&nbsp;    Although some faculty denounced LAPDs actions    in a letter    before the university, Gordon Klein, an accounting lecturer, mocked students requests for final exam accommodations and labeled such measures as special treatment.   Ajax Peris, a political science lecturer, is currently    under review    by the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion for reading aloud a racial slur within a Martin Luther King Jr. quote in a lecture  and refusing to acknowledge students who spoke out against his language.&nbsp;    Meanwhile, the university is toeing the line of complete silence, talking just long enough to maintain the facade of allyship. But its silence is not neutral to   students who feel their university has forsaken them. And with such a powerful voice, UCLA has a responsibility to speak out.&nbsp;    What LAPD did was cruel and unjust. It put people at risk and showed an utter disdain for the Black Lives Matter movement.&nbsp;    UCLA may not have been directly   behind these injustices. But it remains unwilling to actively speak out against those who were.    That makes them just as complicit.   &nbsp;    Disclaimer:     The Editorial Board does not have any Black members, which we recognize is unacceptable. In fact, Black student journalists and Black student voices have been continually underrepresented in the Daily Bruin newsroom. We recognize that this lack of inclusion is a disservice to the UCLA community, and for this, we apologize  we are working on it.&nbsp;      We are committed to rectifying this, not only through words, but through action, including measures that begin with, but are not limited to: making a more focused effort to recruit students of color, implementing editor diversity training and looking at how we can support staffers from low-income backgrounds.      The long process as we attempt to remedy our own lack of inclusivity and diversity, however, is no excuse for silence on our part in the present.   &nbsp; ",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/edi-12.png

But after the U.S. Department of State increased the travel advisory to China to level four, the highest level, the group made the decision to cancel the trip because of its connecting flight to Shanghai.  Deffebach, a fourth-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student, is one of many UCLA students who have had to alter their spring break plans because of the worldwide coronavirus outbreak.  Our health and the health of others coming home and not missing school is more important, she said. Hopefully, we'll get there one day.  The disease has spread to 114 countries and infected over 118,000 people since it was first detected in December, according to  the World Health Organization . The WHO announced Wednesday that it now considers COVID-19 a pandemic, the first time a coronavirus has received that distinction.  Deffebach and her friends arent the only ones who have canceled their spring break trips because of the outbreak.  Nisha Rajasekar, a third-year business economics student, said she canceled her upcoming trip to Mexico and will instead return home to Austin. She added her primary concern is leaving safely through the Los Angeles International Airport because several cases have occurred within the city.  There are more outbreaks in LA than there are in most other places that everyone's spring breaking in, Rajasekar said.  There are 27 known cases in LA County as of Wednesday, according to a Los Angeles County Department of Public Health  press release . The LACDPH also announced the first coronavirus-related death in LA County on Wednesday, a nonresident older adult who recently spent time in South Korea.  Additionally, as of Friday, two LAX screeners, who check passengers for COVID-19 symptoms, tested positive for the new coronavirus.  The two screeners worked in the same quarantine station, meaning they likely were exposed to the same source, according to  the Los Angeles Times .  Some airlines, such as American Airlines, have suspended flights to highly affected sites, such as mainland China and Italy.  Locally, UCLA announced in-person classes would be suspended until April 10, two weeks into spring quarter. The move has led some students to leave campus much earlier than expected.  Jordan Barger, a second-year film and television student, said she decided to leave nearly a full week before the official start of final exams after she found out all her lectures were canceled.  Barger will now spend nearly a month at home in Houston.  Barger added that she looks forward to spending extra time with her family, but is worried for her father, who she said is 73 and is more susceptible to COVID-19; older adults and people with serious chronic medical conditions are most at risk from COVID-19, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Rhea Singh, Rajasekars roommate and a third-year statistics student, said she originally planned to go on the Mexico trip, but recently canceled her plans. The trip is nonrefundable, she added, and she and her friends will likely not get money back after canceling the trip.  Singh also expressed concerns about the diseases presence in Los Angeles. However, she said she feels less concerned about COVID-19 at UCLA because it offers a more controlled environment.  Rajasekar added that she thinks people on visas may be cautious to leave the U.S. because it could be harder for them to get back into the country if borders are closed.  The UCLA Dashew Center for International Students will maintain valid immigration status for full-time students and plans to continue operating as normal, said Sam Nahidi, director of the Dashew Center, in an emailed statement to international students Wednesday.  Deffebach, who also canceled a trip to Italy in June, said she was disappointed she had to cancel her trip, but thinks she made the right decision.  She said she still hopes to spend time with friends over spring break  she and her friends plan to spend four nights camping in Big Sur, California.  This is the last break that all my friends and I will have at the same time, she said. But at the same time, we're really young; well probably get there one time in life.  The Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center plans to stay open during spring break, although sick students are advised to stay home. Students with flulike symptoms can call the Ashe Center Infection Control Line at 310-206-6217.","['cap-bernard-mendez', 'cap-celia-janes', 'cap-maanas-oruganti']","['campus', 'international', 'los-angeles', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.lax_.brief_.file_.jpg

There are no vaccines or effective treatments. It is a universal threat, for now.  &nbsp;  However, history suggests that with time, this universal threat will narrow its focus to the most vulnerable among us. American epidemics and natural disasters as varied as the H1N1 influenza epidemic, the California wildfires and Hurricanes Sandy, Katrina and Maria have taught us that the poor and politically disfavored will suffer.  &nbsp;  In nearly every natural disaster or epidemic, a stark divide emerges between those with resources and those without. During the California wildfires, several counties  failed to release  timely evacuation orders in Spanish. Similarly, during Hurricane Sandy, New Yorkers heard evacuation orders, but low-income communities and communities of color  had difficulty marshaling the resources  and alternative housing necessary to evacuate. During Katrina, the levees were not expected to break, but when aid was delivered, it was  too little too late .  &nbsp;  As resident physicians, across specialties, we see daily the impact of a society that has systematically excluded people of color from good health. Our patients are more likely to  die in childbirth , experience  critical delays  in treatment for heart attacks and  die from certain cancers . This is the baseline. Now, coupled with a pandemic and the reality of scarce resources, we fear that these trends of unequal care will be amplified in Los Angeles.  &nbsp;  When we understand that low-income communities often have more need for clear messaging and early intervention, disparities in outcomes during epidemics become predictable. These disparities were evident in the  HIV  and  H1N1 influenza  epidemics and are becoming readily reapparent in the United States' response to COVID-19.  &nbsp;  New York City, New Orleans and Detroit are among the cities with the most infections per 1,000 individuals. There is little to no racial data on the distribution of cases, save for a handful of states, but the preliminary data predicts poor outcomes for Black and brown communities. In  Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin , Black people are severely overrepresented among COVID-19 cases. Given that spread is curtailed by self-isolation, which necessitates space and ample savings, it is understood that poverty affects citizens' abilities to protect themselves and their loved ones. As these numbers rise, we find ourselves gravely concerned over this pandemics impact on citizens in low-income and minority communities across the country and in Los Angeles.  &nbsp;  A dangerous interplay of social systems is setting up our patients of color to have worse outcomes overall from COVID-19.  &nbsp;  People of color are  disproportionately represented  in food services, sanitation work and low-income community health work. They, like us, are front-line workers. Many will expose themselves  without personal protective equipment  in order to provide basic services. People living in multigenerational homes, often in cramped quarters and working jobs with scarce access to PPE, are set up for increased risk of infection.  &nbsp;  Once infected, we worry that access to health care will be unequal. Black, Latinx and Native Americans are  disproportionately uninsured  in Los Angeles, the consequences of which have  already proven fatal . American society has endorsed social distancing based on the premise that our communal health and well-being are interconnected. Our two-tiered health care system does not reflect this reality.  We believe that better data collection is essential for the provision of equitable health care. We agree with the recent call on the Department of Health and Human Services to  start gathering racial and ethnographic data  in this pandemic. These insights will allow us to swiftly reallocate resources where they are most needed and provide up-to-date translations for all community messaging. Although the new Families First Coronavirus Response Act  mandates free testing  for all, the fees associated with an emergency room visit serve as a powerful deterrent from seeking care. Some insurers have offered waivers on all fees related to health care for COVID-19. Los Angeles hospitals should pledge to do the same for the uninsured.  &nbsp;  Furthermore, hospitals must consider health justice when designing their surge plans for the coming days and weeks. In keeping with utilitarian principles,  physician leaders argue  that scarce resources like ventilators should be directed toward young patients with fewer preexisting medical problems. This deepens health care disparities by disadvantaging people of color, who have higher rates of chronic disease. Without policies and systems in place that counteract the institutional racism in our health care system, these guidelines do not acknowledge the realities of race and class in Los Angeles.  &nbsp;  Finally, as physicians, we must question policies and practices that unfairly assign value to our own labor over that of other front-line staff. Our call to #GetMePPE needs to be extended to include all front-line workers  from janitors to cooks to bus drivers.  The coronavirus pandemic will lay bare the racist and classist structures that undergird our health care system. However, it has also demonstrated how quickly change can be enacted when there is a will to do so.  Without action, we risk repeating the errors of natural disasters in uniquely American ways.  Now is the time to create a health care system worthy of our patients  one that faces our history of unequal care in Los Angeles and responds with the swiftness and decisiveness that this era demands.  &nbsp;   Huston-Paterson is a resident physician in surgery at UCLA.

Stephen Bainbridge, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, released a public apology for tweets perpetuating xenophobic stereotypes in late Feburary and early April. One Tweet, first posted Feb. 25 stated: If we all ask nicely, do you think we could get China to ban eating bats, civets, and other wild animals that serve as viral hosts?  He later posted on Twitter on April 6: But I have a number of Chinese students in my class this semester and I wonder if one of them might have brought the virus back from China. I assume not because I know of nobody else at the (law school) who got sick, but still One wonders, in regard to a recent illness he had.  The tweets started to gain attention on social media and caused an interaction with a law student, Alton Wang.  [embed]https://twitter.com/altonwang/status/1248662619604398080[/embed]  &nbsp;  The professors Twitter account has since been deleted.  The Asian/Pacific Islander Law Students Association sent out an  open letter  that condemned the April 6 tweets and contained a list of calls to action for Bainbridge, including that he attend an online community forum and make a public apology.  This is a blatant violation of the spirit of the UCLA Faculty Code of Conduct, which states that faculty at UCLA must not discriminate against students on the basis of race or national origin, the letter reads.  This is not the first time Bainbridge has drawn backlash for remarks made online.  In 2011 , Bainbridge described a customer service representative he spoke with as a moron with an impenetrable accent on his personal blog.  Bainbridge tweeted an apology regarding the 2020 tweets prior to the deletion of his account and emailed an apology to APILSA co-chairs Brendan Pratt and Constance Chan, according to one of his  blog posts . He also issued an apology on his blog.  ""There are unquestionably far too many strains of xenophobia in this country right now, especially taking the form of anti-Asian and anti-Asian American sentiment,"" Bainbridge wrote. I very much regret having given offense and contributedalbeit unintentionally and inadvertently-to a challenging time, he added.  Asian Americans have had to deal with physical and verbal attacks during the pandemic. Advocacy groups and researchers report seeing an increase in reported assaults to tip lines and newspapers, according to  The   New York Times .  There are law students from China who were really hurt by the tweets, Chan said.  You can imagine that, for them, especially having been from China and having just visited (the United States), it was pretty jarring for them to see those tweets, she said.  Bainbridges tweets emerged at a time where there is a lot of tension with Chinese students, Asian American students, and Asian students here on student visas, Pratt added. There is a general concern about Asians safety on campus, he said.  Shuping Dong, a law student, said Bainbridges tweets made her feel terrible because she is from Wuhan, China. The professors words imply that Chinese people are the virus, she said.  Dong said she has already read many hate comments against China and Asians, and added that she thinks having a UCLA law school professor voice similar opinions can worsen the situation instead of helping it.  Wanyi Zhu, a law student, said she felt disappointed about Bainbridges actions.  Bainbridge and others who have a higher social status and influence will do more bad than ordinary Americans if they are sharing hate speech, Zhu said in an email to the Daily Bruin.  We cannot be silent anymore, Zhu added.  UCLA School of Law Dean Jennifer Mnookin sent a  statement  to the UCLA law school community April 14 stating that she appreciated Bainbridges apology and that she was sorry for any harm Bainbridges tweets had caused.  Mnookin and her administration have been in conversation with students and student organizations in order to figure out how to create an inclusive and strong learning environment, according to her statement.  We can  and must  do better, Mnookin says in the statement. In the coming days and weeks, I look forward to working with APILSA, BLSA, and others in our community to continue to listen, learn, and address these issues in meaningful and concrete ways.  APILSA published a  public statement  the same day acknowledging the deans statement and Bainbridges apology.  We need to create a new standard of cultural competency and tolerance and we need accountability for when those in positions of power violate those standards, the statement reads.  Since the deans statement April 14 was released, there have been several meetings involving students, the dean, school administrators and faculty to advance the conversation and identify solutions, said Bill Kisliuk, executive director of communications at the UCLA School of Law.  The goal of these meetings is to identify steps that would help better the curriculum and campus climate so students and community members from every background feel support and feel welcomed at the law school, he added.  The goal of the meetings really is to move forward together, kind of have everybody working in good faith, and have a robust exchange of views, Kisliuk said.  Bainbridge wasnt comfortable attending a large community forum but he did attend a small group meeting April 19 with representatives from APILSA, a representative from the Native American Law Students Association, and some students from China, Chan said.  The details of the meeting were kept confidential, but she and Pratt were glad to be able to have representatives of the community talk to him, Chan said. They look forward to furthering the discussion about cultural competency with him and other faculty, she added.  This isnt the last conversation between students and faculty about how we can all do better, Chan said.",['cap-saumya-gupta'],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.professorracism.file_.jpg

The most contested positions this spring are general representative seats, which have nine candidates total vying for three seats. Only one candidate ran for any of the three seats last year.  There are also two candidate slates this election season: For the People and Cost-Cutting Innovations. For the People was the only slate that put forth candidates in the 2019 election and is now backing Academic Affairs Commissioner Naomi Riley for president.  Cost-Cutting Innovations is also backing a presidential candidate  current General Representative 2 Orion Smedley  as well as a general representative, a facilities commissioner, a transfer student representative and an international student representative.  The race for president saw a spike in candidates this year with five total candidates.  Both referenda on the ballot would increase student fees. One, called the  Cultivating Unity for Bruin Referendum , would implement a quarterly $15 fee  $9 for a summer session  for all undergraduates to supplement the existing Ackerman Student Union fee. This money would go toward space, programming and resources for historically underrepresented and marginalized groups.  The Associated Students UCLA Board of Directors would manage these funds, giving updates and receiving recommendations from USAC, according to the ballot supplementary language. The Mother Organizations Coalition and the Transfer Leadership Coalition can also give input at council meetings where the funds are discussed.  Four costs the referenda is specifically set to address are ASUCLA programming, the development and maintenance of a Black Resource Center, the creation and upkeep of meditation spaces within ASUCLA and the cost of rent for the Transfer Student Center.  The other ,  titled the  Good Clothes Good People Basic Needs Referendum , would implement a new $0.33 per quarter undergraduate student fee to fund the purchase of school supplies and hygiene products, which would be distributed by the Good Clothes Good People redistribution center.  Good Clothes Good People is a USAC-housed project which offers undergraduates clothing, school supplies, menstrual hygiene products and other basic needs items at no cost.  The 2020 election is set to proceed despite UCLAs shift to online instruction for the spring quarter and will transition to virtual means as well. The 2020 USAC Candidate Debate will be held in cooperation with the Daily Bruin virtually April 30 from 7-9 p.m.  Voting is set to begin on May 4 and run until May 8 midday.

For their parents, it may be a mindless animated romp fraught with played-out conventions.  Released April 22 on Netflix, The Willoughbys is based on the beloved childrens book written by Lois Lowry and follows the eponymous Willoughby clan, an old-fashioned family living in modern society. But the Willoughby parents (Martin Short and Jane Krakowski) inexplicably hate their four children, repeatedly neglecting and castigating them, even throwing them into a coal bin. Left to their own devices, the four resourceful children create a travel brochure to convince their parents to take a trip  a dangerous odyssey the children hope will kill their parents, thereby orphaning themselves.  Beyond this initial driving plot point, however, The Willoughbys design makes the whole film a trip in and of itself. Although made completely with CGI, director Kris Pearn adds a stylized appearance that's a pretty seamless alternative to classic claymation. The characters' facial expressions are wonderfully detailed. Their rounded eyes convey a depth of human emotion while the slightest tension in the corner of their mouths manage to say more than words ever could.   [Related:    Movie review: Sonic the Hedgehog designs updated for fans, still runs short on entertainment   ]   And the humans arent even the best looking characters in the film. ""The Willoughbys"" narrator, The Cat (Ricky Gervais), sports a large body and little legs and is a funny, adorable character who steals the show throughout the films 1:32 runtime.  Despite the film's average length, ""The Willoughbys"" feels much shorter than it is. Each moment is packed with action and dizzying colors in the hopes of creating an engaging story. While visually exciting, the constant jumping from event to event grows tiresome and   the plot is hard to parse out at times as the traditional narrative is sacrificed for a series of entertaining but loosely related events.  And while the characters look impressively human, their characterization is weak. Each Willoughby family member is given one or two traits that regrettably encapsulate all that they are as characters. The Willoughby parents are selfish when dealing with other people while maintaining their love for each other  . The oldest brother, Tim Willoughby (Will Forte), aspires to bring honor back to his familys name and constantly worries, while his younger sister Jane Willoughby (Alessia Cara) sings and dreams about what could be. With only a couple of personality traits to their name, these characters are two-dimensional in every way and they fail to demand sympathy.  The film is further stuffed with conventional tropes that create an easy-viewing film. Comedic gags peppered through the The Willoughbys""  meant to draw out a cheap laugh  fell flat because of their obvious delivery. In a particularly egregious moment of unoriginality, Jane sings a song at the moment when all hope feels lost. While almost certainly meant to be beautiful and loving, the scene felt sickly sweet and drew a groan when later revealed that the song saved the childrens lives.  The song itself, however, is one of the best parts of the film. Created for the film and performed by Cara, I Choose is a ballad honoring the film's central theme of togetherness. Cara sings it well, emoting beautifully throughout the song, though the lyrics   hit the nail on the head a little too obviously. The song will no doubt endure for years to come, unlike the otherwise forgettable film.   [Related:    Movie review: Frozen II is the next right thing in Disneys unique approach to princess sequels   ]   But what hurts the most for ""The Willoughbys"" is its refusal to tackle the world's tougher subjects. At one point in the film, the four Willoughby children are split up by the Department of Orphan Services, the film's version of Child Protective Services.   The entire storyline with the agency takes up about 10 minutes of screentime, from the time it is introduced on screen to its last mention in the movie. So while the film couldve been a commentary on subpar parenting and state resources for neglected children, it turns away from these difficult subjects and instead stays in its lane a  s an uninspiring comedy.    Even the film's central message dealing with the importance of family comes across as a rip-off. Family togetherness in the face of tragic circumstances was a theme already thoroughly investigated in Pixars Onward, which was released earlier this year. Past family films have presented a more nuanced discussion of togetherness than ""The Willoughbys,"" while the Netflix production is just a colorful mess patched together with barely alive characters.    The film passes as a decent distraction for bored children, but don't count on ""The Willoughbys"" to draw people together even at a time like this.",['cap-mark-mcgreal'],"['arts-entertainment', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/3.jpg

The decision will go into effect June 12.    Guillermo Andres   Cortes was accused of sexually assaulting three women between 2015 and 2017 while he worked at the Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center.    The complainant, Meena Zareh, a physician and former colleague of Cortes, first filed a civil suit against Cortes in December 2016.    Cortes began working at the David Geffen School of Medicine as a Cardiac Electrophysiology Fellow in June 2017, after each of the reported incidents occurred.    Cortes medical license was temporarily suspended in May 2018 once the accusations were first leveled. UCLA also placed him on paid suspension following the accusations.    In February, Administrative Law Judge Thomas Heller    concluded    there was clear and convincing evidence that Cortes committed sexual assault in one of the three reported cases and recommended that the board revoke Cortes license.    [Related link:    UCLA cardiologist accused of sexual assault should have license revoked, says judge   ]    Heller did not find sufficient evidence to prove Cortes committed sexual assault in the other two cases.    Zareh accused Cortes of sexually assaulting her in the hospitals call room in November 2015 while Zareh was a third-year medical resident at the hospital.    Following the 2015 assault, Zareh notified her residencys program director of the incident in February 2016 and asked to not be scheduled to work with Cortes. However, Zareh still had to work with Cortes on two separate occasions after reporting the incident.    Cortes was placed on leave later that month while the hospital conducted an internal investigation.    Once his license is revoked, Cortes will no longer be able to continue his studies at UCLA, as a medical license is required to do so, a UCLA spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times.

Assembly Bill 2712, which was proposed by California State Assemblyman Evan Low on Feb. 20, would provide California residents over the age of 18 with a universal basic income of $1,000 per month, except as specified.  The idea of universal basic income gained popularity after former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang made the concept a cornerstone of his campaign.  The California proposal would be funded by a 10% tax on certain goods and services in the state ranging from raw materials to technologies, according to the bill.  Martin Gilens, a public policy professor at UCLA, said the bill could be beneficial for providing assistance to lower-income individuals by paying for basic necessities but added he has concerns about the bill&#8217;s universal applicability.  &#8220;While universal basic income could provide that kind of assistance, I don't think it's necessary to give money to the well-off, which, of course, the universal basic income does, in order to generate sufficient political support for anti-poverty efforts,&#8221; Gilens said.  The United States has always been a highly individualistic society in which there is a cultural resistance to the idea of government handouts, which could hinder support for the bill, Gilens added.  ""(This cultural resistance) doesn't mean citizens don't see an important role for government and helping those who, for no fault of their own, are not able to support themselves, but it does mean that the notion of just kind of giving money to everybody, whether they need it or not, generates resistance,&#8221; he said.  Kenya Covington, a public policy lecturer, said the bill does not redistribute wealth in a way that helps the most financially vulnerable in society and may not be the best solution to income inequality in the U.S.  Additionally, there are restrictions to those that qualify for basic income. Individuals relying on social welfare programs like Medi-Cal, County Medical Services Program, CalFresh, CalWORKs or Unemployment Insurance cannot qualify for basic income, according to the bill.  Covington added that because of this eligibility clause in the bill, it may do more harm than good for low-income individuals, especially those who are in these social welfare programs that would exclude them from universal basic income.  &#8220;The structure of the program seems to be in conflict with the purpose of the program,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This would mean some of these other programs will need to be reduced or done away with altogether. I think that pits poor people against poor people.&#8221;  Covington added she thinks there should be a comprehensive policy analysis of the bill to understand how it would realistically function, particularly because there currently is not a great understanding of how the bill would intersect with other important social safety net programs.  Racquel Fox, a first-year environmental science student, also said she believes legislators should reexamine the bill, as the UBI would end up in the hands of individuals who do not need the money.  &#8220;(The bill) seems really not that effective to me because the people who need the income, they&#8217;re the ones who are on government welfare programs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel like (the government) would just be giving people $1,000 who don't need it as much.&#8221;  The 10% value-added tax on certain goods and services would exclude medicine and medical supplies, education materials and fees, and basic necessities like food and clothing, according to the bill.  Gilens said value-added taxes like these are regressive, meaning the tax would apply to a higher portion of low-income citizens than high-income citizens. This could cause an imbalance in the relationship between the money paid in taxes and the money received through the proposed income, he added.  Gilens said he does not believe the bill will be implemented on a national scale in the near future. Covington added she thinks it would need to undergo serious modifications.  Will Hollister, a first-year civil engineering student, also said he thinks the bill may not be ready to take effect now, but if the U.S. has a Democratic president in the future, it may be more likely.  &#8220;If a Democratic candidate wins in the future, I feel like that's going to be one of their pillars of a campaign, policies that benefit the lower class and raise the standards of living,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do I think it's going to be in the form of $1,000? I'm not sure, but something along those lines I think will come up in the future.&#8221; ",['cap-lily-flick'],"['california', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.universalincome.NT_.jpg

But if that weren't enough, it's robbing them of their tuition money as well.  Shortly following the decision to move classes online, UCLA announced that students were  not  going to receive a reduction in campus tuition and fees. The decision quickly led to backlash from the community, including an online  petition  with more than 7,600 signatures calling for lower spring tuition at schools affected by COVID-19.   In the midst of a   quickly escalating and   unprecedented global pandemic, it&#8217;s understandable that universities struggled to make last-minute decisions in order to adjust. After all, students were on the brink of taking their final exams just before it was abruptly  announced  that instruction for the rest of winter quarter would be conducted remotely.  But   now that the new normal is here,   continuing to milk students for unadjusted tuition costs isn&#8217;t a fair solution.  The UC still has a chance to reduce tuition costs for spring quarter. But if it drops the ball this time around, it at least needs to start planning for the tuition reductions that should come in the case of a virtual future. And while UCLA may be powerless in its ability to reduce UC tuition costs, it does have jurisdiction over student fees &#8211; more specifically, the power to adjust them accordingly.     In the meantime, students will still have to pay their dues in return for just a fraction of what their education   is really worth.  Kevin Chen, a third-year applied mathematics student, said a large proportion of students will be paying for on-campus services they won't have access to.    &#8220;We&#8217;re losing our opportunity to have in-person peer discussions, access to gyms, study spots on campus, (Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center) resources and in-person opportunities for office hours,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;We&#8217;re also losing access to a lot of on-campus events that aren&#8217;t going to be virtual this quarter, so I think that (the UC) should really reconsider their spring tuition policy.&#8221;  Chen is an international student and, like others, is still obligated to pay the full annual cost of tuition for nonresident students, which equates to roughly  $43,000 .  A UC education has been reduced to URL links and video meetings. And this shift is especially difficult for out-of-state and international students, who are now paying tens of thousands more dollars to click on the same hyperlinks as their peers.  An emailed statement from UC spokesperson Sarah McBride stated that many of the fees that students are paying for will be covering costs such as campus infrastructure maintenance.  But despite the UC&#8217;s claims, many campus facilities have closed in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In UCLA&#8217;s case, this includes Ackerman Union and recreational facilities &#8211; charges for both of which are still reflected on BruinBill.   And with California&#8217;s restrictive stay-at-home  orders  in place, it&#8217;s safe to say that students still in the Westwood area won&#8217;t be trying to go out and get their money&#8217;s worth of student services.  Robert Watson, a fourth-year political science student and president of the UCLA Undergraduate Students Association Council,   said he understands why students are upset about the decision to keep spring quarter tuition as is.  &#8220;Most of the services that I&#8217;d be offered or provided, I&#8217;m not getting access to, and that can be upsetting,"" said Watson. ""This (decision) doesn&#8217;t come across as supportive to students who are going through financial hardships right now as a result of the pandemic as well.""  Even if spring quarter&#8217;s tuition money is beyond the point of no return,  nor refund,   the UC still faces the possibility of conducting future quarters remotely. And if worst truly does come to worst, students deserve more than a simple deadline  extension  to pay   up.  The official statement from the University of California Office of the President mentioned that it is too early to predict whether action needs to be taken by the UC after summer session ends.  However, the signs are pointing to a quarantine that may be extended indefinitely: Summer session A, which is scheduled to end Aug. 28, is going to be held  remotely , and experts have  warned  that the true statistic of COVID-19 cases in California may be much higher than official numbers.  If there&#8217;s anything to be taken away from the last week of winter quarter, it&#8217;s that unforeseen circumstances can lead major judgment calls with little time to adjust. Unfortunately, the UC doesn't always have good judgment.  Granted, the board of regents attempted to show its support for students facing financial difficulties when it announced its recent decision to postpone a vote that could have increased tuition over the next few years. But the glaring issue of high tuition for an online education is rearing its ugly head, and the UC still has a chance to make things right.  Rather than continuing to monitor the situation until it becomes too late to react properly again, the UC should use this head start to make the necessary adjustments.  Online classes are already bad enough without forcing students to pay for them by the thousands.

A new order mandating the use of cloth face coverings at essential businesses to protect residents during the coronavirus pandemic will go into effect Friday, Garcetti said at the citys daily press briefing.  We wanted to wait until these were available, Garcetti said. We can see people now selling them on corners, online. Our capacity, thanks to the amazing apparel industry here, has expanded.  Under the order, businesses must provide the coverings for their employees or reimburse them for the cost. Stores may also deny entry to customers who do not bring their own face mask.  Workers that require a higher level of protection, such as doctors who may need N95 or surgical masks, are exempt from the order. The order only applies only to a subset of businesses allowed to operate under the citys Safer At Home order.  However, the order does not apply to some occupations, such as postal workers who often are not provided with any personal protective equipment at all. Public health officials concluded that these fields of work lack the close interaction for which masks are beneficial, Garcetti said in a Wednesday press briefing.  Garcetti said those who do not comply may receive an administrative citation, which results in a fine but no arrest.  Our idea is not to be arresting and fining people for the face coverings, Garcetti said. We're relying on people to use their judgment, to use their own self-enforcement. ... When you ask people to do that, they actually do step up.  The order also encourages essential retail businesses to add an acrylic barrier at points of sale, although Garcetti said there is not enough acrylic to install barriers in every store in the city.  Los Angeles was one of the first cities in the United States to recommend public use of cloth face coverings. It is also now one of a growing number of cities and by far the largest city in the nation to mandate face coverings.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention switched its stance on masks and started recommending the public wear cloth face coverings a day after Garcettis own recommendation on April 1.  Garment workers in the citys fashion district have gained recognition for switching to mask production to meet the public demand. The city started the L.A. Protects program on March 27 to recruit textile businesses to produce masks and distribute them to essential businesses.  UCLA officials announced Wednesday that the university will comply with the order and provide mandatory face coverings for its employees at the UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center, Tiverton House, Lake Arrowhead Conference Center and UCLA housing and dining facilities starting Friday.  Some stores in Los Angeles have already been providing its workers with masks. Silvio Wong, a manager at Target Westwood, said the store has already placed orders for masks and expects to receive them within the week.  Since the mayor has issued the mandate for the mask, every store has escalated the order for the masks to have them as soon as possible, Wong said. This is an important business. We have to make sure that everyone's safe and protected.  If the masks do not arrive before Friday, employees will have to bring their own fabric coverings to work, Wong said. Any masks that the store receives for sale are being recalled for distribution to health care facilities.  Other stores already had some of the orders provisions in place. At the 7-Eleven in Westwood, a wall of clear plastic shower curtains separate the cashier from the customers, who must wear masks to enter the store. If a customer does not have a mask, an employee picks up items on their behalf.  [caption id=""attachment_378295"" align=""alignleft"" width=""620""]  Penny Grady rings up a customer behind a shower curtain barrier at the 7-Eleven in Westwood Village. (Jintak Han/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Wednesday was Penny Gradys first day working at Westwoods 7-Eleven. She transferred from a 7-Eleven in Downtown Los Angeles to the Village because of a shortage of staff.  Grady wore a surgical mask that her boss provided.  It's difficult to find (masks), Grady said. It's scary when you don't know which one to wear to protect yourself correctly. Some of them, it's hard to breathe in ... I think that's why a lot of people don't wear them, but if it will help prevent the spreading, then I'm wearing them.  Students also struggled to find masks, both surgical and cloth, to wear while shopping.  Ariana Kazemi, a fourth-year electrical engineering student, spent her Wednesday afternoon shopping for groceries at Ralphs with her friend Madison Hoo, a fourth-year fine arts student. They both wore latex gloves that Hoo bought, but did not have masks.  We primarily looked online, Hoo said. Or like in stores, even if I asked an employee, they're like, Yeah, we don't have it.  With the order going into effect Friday, Kazemi and Hoo said they will try to make their own face coverings.  I feel kind of bad that I'm not wearing a mask, because I look around and everyone's wearing one, Hoo said. I'm probably going to try to make one if I can because I don't want other people to get in trouble for me not wearing a mask.",['cap-jhan'],"['los-angeles', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/H5D0212.jpg

Kang Eric Ting, a professor in the School of Dentistry, claimed he faced retaliatory abuse after he testified against Sotirios Tetradis, a senior associate dean of the School of Dentistry, in a Title IX sexual harassment proceeding against Tetradis in 2018. Ting said the testimony resulted in his removal as the chair of the Section of Orthodontics.    Ting said he first faced harassment and discrimination from department faculty after he requested a leave of absence to care for his ailing father in Taiwan at the end of 2017, according to the complaint filed with the court.    UCLA, Tetradis, School of Dentistry Dean Paul Krebsbach and four professors who served as interim replacements for Ting are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit.    Justine Tanjaya, a doctoral student in the School of Dentistry and Tings mentee, filed a sexual harassment complaint against Tetradis in June 2018 and sued Tetradis and the UC in federal court in April 2019.    In Tanjayas lawsuit, Tanjaya also claimed Tetradis urged her to file a false Title IX complaint against Ting, which she declined. Tetradis still made false sexual harassment allegations against Ting on Tanjayas behalf, according to court documents.    Ting said Tetradis allegations delayed his leave of absence by six weeks.    The complaint said Tetradis and Krebsbachs hostility caused Ting to develop insomnia ,  anxiety, depression, a stomach ulcer and gastrointestinal issues, the last of which required a gastrointestinal tract procedure. Ting also alleged the university failed to accommodate for his health issues by questioning his medical leaves.    Ting also filed multiple grievances with the university in 2018, including a Title IX complaint   for discrimination against his health conditions. The Title IX Office and the Academic Senate denied Tings grievances and closed the complaints.    Californias Department of Fair Employment and Housing issued Ting a right to sue letter in December 2019 after he filed his second DFEH complaint. Ting first reported the retaliation allegations to DFEH in August 2018.    Douglas Mirell, Tings attorney, said the complaint speaks for itself but declined to comment further.    A spokesperson for UCLA declined to comment. ",['cap-jhan'],"['news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Image-from-iOS-8.jpg

Garcetti, who spoke at a Monday press briefing, said the countys testing capacity has expanded to a point where any county resident who shows symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, can get tested at any of the 13 testing sites in the county.    That doesn't mean we'll have a test for everybody tomorrow, Garcetti said, but it means that our capacity is now greater than the number  (of eligible residents)  that we are getting through the requirements that we had.    The county initially reserved testing for those most vulnerable to the disease as the United States experienced a shortage of coronavirus testing kits. Previous restrictions narrowed eligibility for the tests to symptomatic patients who are either 65 or older or have underlying health conditions.    Those who had more than seven days left of a government-mandated two-week quarantine were also eligible under the old guidelines, even if they did not show symptoms.    Most experts agree that early widespread testing is crucial to containing the coronavirus, which can spread asymptomatically.    Expansion of testing comes as LA Countys Department of Public Health announced 15 new coronavirus-related deaths Monday, bringing the death toll to 147. More than 6,300 county residents have tested positive for the coronavirus.    However, the county has not released information on how many people have recovered from a coronavirus infection. Garcetti said the mixture of public and private institutions carrying out the tests makes tracking recovery figures difficult.    New testing methods may help collect this data. Researchers at Stanford University started implementing a newly developed antibody test Friday. Antibody tests, which look for the bodys immune response to the virus in blood, differ from conventional nose swab tests in that they can test for the coronavirus after remission.    Garcetti said he does not expect them to be available in Los Angeles in the coming weeks because universities and commercial labs are sending their first batches of antibody tests to the East Coast, where the pandemic has devastated areas such as New York City.

It can cover rent for Westwood apartments sitting empty during a countywide &#8220;safer at home&#8221; order. It could help alleviate the burden caused by lost jobs that previously paid tuition.  Or it can sit and do nothing, as legislators leave college students affected by the COVID-19 pandemic out in the cold.  The $2.2 trillion bipartisan stimulus package, signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 27, is meant to provide economic relief to Americans affected by the novel coronavirus outbreak. The bill offers a host of economic assistance to individuals, such as increased unemployment benefits and, most notably, a $1,200 check to qualifying taxpayers.  At face value, this bill is great. It provides immediate financial relief alongside other desperately needed welfare benefits.  But there&#8217;s a problem: Scores of college students will not qualify for the stimulus check.  If a college student is under 24 years old and claimed as a dependent on a tax return, the student is exempt from stimulus check benefits.  On top of that, many parents will be disqualified from receiving benefits if their 2018 or 2019 gross income is too high. But considering current unemployment rates, many households have past tax returns that don&#8217;t reflect the current reality.  This catch-22 obviously presents a huge problem for college students and their families. For many of them, buying last-minute flights back home or making payments to relentless landlords in Los Angeles means an additional financial burden atop the economic woes their parents are suffering.   Not to mention, our newly minted Zoom university hasn&#8217;t reduced campus fees or tuition.  The stimulus bill does include a six-month break in student loan payments &#8211; students with federal debt loans won&#8217;t need to make any sort of payment until October 2020 and any interest accrued during this period will be waived.  But it's not enough.  Higher education may be more accessible because of online collaborative networks and video conferencing. However, many students opted to  withdraw  from their respective universities when faced with the combination of a lackluster online education and the burden of full tuition requirements.  These costs, coupled with the fact that many students have lost their source of steady income, makes higher education all the more stressful and ultimately, unaffordable.  Understandably, legislators pushed this bill through Congress after less than 48 hours of bipartisan negotiations. Given the unfolding global crisis, time was of the essence.  But this bill is nowhere near finished.  Granted, many college-age students often have the support of their families. But for those who don&#8217;t &#8211; or for those whose families are struggling to make ends meet &#8211; this stimulus package leaves them stranded by no fault of their own. In fact, being a traditional college student has created an almost automatic disqualification for thousands &#8211; those who are above 17 but still listed as dependents are effectively ineligible for federal aid.  California Senator Diane Feinstein  said  the stimulus bill was a good start, but &#8220;more needs to be done.&#8221;  And while she didn&#8217;t specify exactly what that is, perhaps looking toward the needs of public university students in her home state is a good start.

The USAC election, which had 30 candidates vying for 15 seats, had a 30.06% voter turnout. The race was highly contentious: five candidates ran for president compared to three last year, while only six out of 15 seats were unopposed, compared to nine last year. Three seats last year were also left entirely vacant, resulting in a fall special election to fill the incomplete council.  Candidates from two slates, For the People and Cost Cutting Innovations, as well as independents filled the new council.  Full results are at the bottom of this article.  Students voted against the Cultivating Unity for Bruins referenda which would have increased student fees by $45 per academic year. The referenda was intended to fund a Black Resource Center, establish meditation spaces within Associated Students UCLA and fund rent for the Transfer Student Center.  The Good Clothes Good People Basic Needs Referenda passed, which will raise student fees by $0.99 annually to fund supplies for the GCGP redistribution center that works to supply students with basic needs and school supplies.  Newly elected president Naomi Riley said she will work to change the perception that USAC is inaccessible. Riley served as Academic Affairs commissioner this year and ran against four other candidates.  Riley, who was a co-author and supporter of the CUB referendum, said she was heartbroken that it did not pass.  I think that everyone knows I was one of the candidates who was most vocal about their support for CUB, largely because I was one of the authors at the table that helped in drafting the referendum, Riley said. I'm heartbroken that it didn't get passed but the challenges still remain.  Orion Smedley, who lost the race for president, said he was surprised at the results, but added he was happy for the other candidates on his slate. Smedley ran on the Cost Cutting Innovations slate which now has two candidates on USAC.  Newly elected Academic Affairs commissioner Breeze Velazquez said one of her first goals will be to increase transparency to students, specifically by creating a Reddit account and using its social media platforms to distribute information to students. As for more long term goals, she said she hopes to increase student access programs such as Books for Bruins, which gives students money for textbooks and school materials.  Aidan Arasasingham, the newly elected external vice president, said his priority in office is to address the urgent basic needs and affordability issues caused by COVID-19.  Arasasingham also said one of his initial steps as EVP will be to form a Community Advisory Council as laid out in his platform, similar to Rileys proposal for a Congressional Advisory Board. The council would advise USAC on its major decisions and operations.  We need to make good on that promise, Arasasingham said. And build the kind of base where we can convene student leaders, work together in collaboration and be held accountable to their priorities in order to make change and make good on the kind of progress that we need to see right now during this pandemic.  Arasasingham said he was disappointed the voters rejected the CUB referendum. However, he said USAC could use its financial resources, along with those provided by its state, federal and philanthropic partners, to fill the funding gaps until the referendum could be replicated in the future.  Despite losing to Arasasingham, former EVP candidate Carl Illustrisimo said he was grateful for how his campaign grew during the election.  I think the things that the campaign fought for  that we fought for  were radical change on campus, were all these different types of institutional changes and ways of pressuring admin, Illustrisimo said. I think I resonated with a lot of people.  Christina Read, the newly elected Student Wellness commissioner, said she plans to optimize the effectiveness of the SWCs programs and expand their student outreach in collaboration with student organizations.  Making sure that students are really aware of resources for finding nutritious food, like programs like CalFresh or the Economic Crisis Response Team, of course is going to be a priority, Read said.  Andrea Robinson, who ran for general representative but lost, said she hopes the winning candidates will work to help the student body given that plans for fall instruction are still being decided.  General Representative 3 Brandon Broukhim, who lost the race for internal vice president, said he was proud to have run a clean race, but added that there was a lot of toxicity on the Reddit platform.  There were very inappropriate comments made about me on Reddit, Broukhim said. It bothered me and other candidates, and Im sorry for anybody who had to endure that.  Nadine Avari, who lost the race for International student representative, said she thinks the elections board did a good job of supporting the candidates through the election.  In a time like this, when people are in different time zones, when people are stressed, when theres so much anxiety, I think having that extra support from the election board without them biasing the election, was really important, Avari said.  &nbsp;  FULL RESULTS:   President   Naomi Riley (For the People)   Internal vice president   Emily Hong Van Luong (For the People)   External vice president   Aidan Arasasingham (Independent)   General representatives  1.

Gavin Newsom ordered a temporary ban on statewide evictions Friday as the state grapples with the spread of the new coronavirus.    The governor's    executive order    is in effect until May 31 and comes amid    statewide orders    to stay at home, practice social distancing and shut down nonessential businesses. Such orders have caused some people to lose income, putting them at risk of failing to pay their rent.    Newsom said at a press conference that his office allowed county and city governments to set limits on evictions March 16, but not all jurisdictions suspended evictions.    LA Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an eviction moratorium for commercial and residential tenants March 17 and extended protections Monday. The LA moratorium would have lasted until April 19.    Los Angeles has been a leader in this space. ... Thirty jurisdictions had moved already or moved now more aggressively to establish this framework, but only 30, Newsom said. As a consequence of that, today we just established a new overlay for the state of California that denies the capacity for enforcement, court proceedings for any evictions through May 31.    Tenants unable to pay rent must notify their landlord up to seven days after payment is due; however, tenants must eventually pay their rent.      Tenants can temporarily forgo paying rent if they have a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, or if they are caring for someone confirmed or suspected of having the disease.    Additionally, tenants can invoke the order if they have experienced a loss of income relating to COVID-19 and government safer at home orders. Lastly, the order applies to tenants who have to skip work to care for a child whose school was closed.    Newsom added that his executive order does not preempt any local ordinances that go further in suspending evictions.

Sui is one of dozens of individuals implicated in the 2019 college admissions scandal, a nationwide bribery scheme that enabled the admission of students to elite universities through cheating   on entrance exams and false athletic recruitment.    Sui, a Chinese national who resides in Canada, pled guilty to bribery in February. She was detained by Spanish authorities in September and was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud at the time of her arrest.   The February plea agreement was meant to spare her from further time after her detainment in Spain.    While Douglas P. Woodlock, the district judge presiding over the case, accepted the plea at the time of sentencing, he said Sui should face the highest fine possible, according to    Reuters   .    Sui paid William Singer, known as the ringleader of the admissions scandal, to have her son accepted into UCLA.    Singer, who pled guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy and money laundering in March 2019, instructed Sui to pay $100,000 to his fake charitable organization, the Key Worldwide Foundation, in October 2018. Singer then connected Suis son to Jorge Salcedo, the former UCLA men's soccer coach, who designated him as a recruit.    Suis son later received a 25% athletic scholarship to UCLA.  According to UCLA Athletics, the student received a provisional admission and was never officially accepted or enrolled at UCLA.   Salcedo, who resigned following his involvement in the scandal, pled    guilty    to conspiring to commit racketeering in April.

And even as its newly elected members gear up for the upcoming school year, outgoing USAC members spent their latest meeting lamenting the Cultivating Unity for Bruins Referendums failure to pass.  Old habits die hard.  This was not a referendum anyone from the council proposed, but rather one they almost unanimously endorsed.  The CUB referendum, meant to finance the creation of spaces for marginalized communities on campus, including a proposed Black Resource Center, would have added $15 in student fees per undergraduate student per quarter.  Last week, students voted to not pass the referendum.  This doesnt have to mean the end for the suggested Black Resource Center. Student leaders know this. In fact, newly elected members of USAC took to social media to announce plans for supporting the referendums initiatives through their own offices work.  But talk is cheap. The fact of the matter is that students wont be taking on the financial burden of creating the center this year. Instead of perpetuating divisive, single-issue rhetoric, incoming council members should note they have the budget to tackle and carry out the project themselves.  According to  data  collected by The Bruin, referendum and office fees have left thousands of dollars in unused funds. The Green Initiative Fund referendum, passed in 2008, was a $4 per quarter increase in student fees. In 2019, the Green Initiative Fund had close to $130,000 of allocated funds left over.  The USA Elections Board also received an additional $10,000 from USAC allocations to fund voter turnout giveaways, said USA Elections Board Chair Navi Sidhu in an emailed statement. Thats close to a years worth of an in-state students tuition to motivate students to log onto MyUCLA and fill out a ballot.  Regardless of whether this money was used wisely, its clear that the council is swimming in cash that could go toward meaningful projects like a Black Resource Center. Whats even more hypocritical for members of the student government is to  berate  students for being unable to fund such endorsed initiatives when the councils own surplus funds could cover the cost.  Initial costs for the Black Resource Center are estimated at about  $182,000 , and a majority of incoming council members endorsed the referendum. If the CUB referendum had passed, this money would have come out of students own wallets  money that could instead come from the council itself.  And while the editorial board did endorse the CUB referendum for its initiative to represent the historically unrepresented, students have made it clear that its failure to pass was because of the fear of additional financial strain, no matter how little or how big, amid a global pandemic  nothing more. Its unreasonable for USAC officials to claim otherwise out of emotionally charged disappointment for the referendums failure.  Its clear many in USAC found the centers creation important; they advocated on social media to ensure voter turnout met the minimal threshold for any approved referenda to be implemented, according to a  screenshot  uploaded to Reddit.  USAC does not lead referenda, despite what efforts may come from offices who openly support and endorse them.  But it does oversee a $9 million budget  one that could fund bigger projects than giveaways strictly aimed at enticing students to vote. Judging from whats  reported  in the books, theres more than enough to start work on the Black Resource Center.  CUB wasnt USACs idea, but members overwhelmingly supported it.  So instead of using official Twitter accounts to retweet negative rhetoric surrounding students who opposed the referendum, the next wave of USAC student leaders could and should mobilize their support into meaningful change.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/edi-8.png

Session A, which is scheduled from June 22 to Aug. 28, includes nine- and 10-week summer intensive classes. Classes that require fieldwork or specialized equipment will need to modify their syllabuses, said Emily Carter, executive vice chancellor and provost, and Patricia Turner, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, in an emailed statement to students.  The university has not yet decided whether to extend remote instruction to summer session C, which starts Aug. 3 and ends Sept. 11. However, the statement asked faculty members to start planning for such a decision.  Per-unit tuition will remain the same: $279 for UC undergraduates, $349 for UC graduate students and $360 for all others, said Jaime Balboa, assistant vice provost of Summer Sessions and Study Abroad, in an emailed statement. The transition to remote instruction will not impact financial aid eligibility.  Quality of instruction is always a top priority at UCLA, Balboa said. This was heavy on our minds when we made the decision to convert Session A to remote instruction now, at the beginning of Spring Quarter. The more lead time the faculty has to prepare, the better the learning experience will be for our students.  University officials did not return a comment in time for this article.  The extension comes as two additional students living in off-campus, non-university housing tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UCLA community to nine.

Whether they're from California or across the globe, students will have to adjust to a new reality of social distancing and quarantining to help   halt the spread of COVID-19. As the number of cases continues to rise and much of the world is going on lockdown, solitude may become a more salient problem for Bruins stuck inside.  If you're missing friends, struggling to get along with family members or just want some company during the long days indoors, The Quad has compiled a   guide to fending off feelings of loneliness and boredom during the quarantine.  To begin, enjoying live music from your favorite artists in real-time is now a possibility.   On March 16, Coldplay performed a live concert on Instagram for the  ""  Together At Home:"" WHO-Global Citizen Solidarity Sessions  and John Legend quickly followed suit with his own live-stream concert the following day. Since then, the two have been joined by a host of artists including Hozier, H.E.R. and Charlie Puth.  All the performances can be found on  its website , and the campaign will continue to collaborate with artists in the coming weeks. The virtual concerts can ease your fear of missing out as the originally scheduled Coachella weekend one arrives, and the best part  watching your favorite acts is free.   [Related:  Professors reorganize, students adjust to first week of online classes ]    If Bruins are itching to get creative, some famous illustrators are offering  free online drawing classes.  Carson Ellis, a children's book illustrator, has a daily  Quarantine Art Club  through her Instagram account, while  Jarrett J. Krosoczka , a picture book author and illustrator, has a similar program through his YouTube channel. Additionally, other authors and illustrators have chosen to do  read alongs via social media  to help pass the time.  A more active choice to combat boredom and cultivate a healthy quarantine lifestyle is to take an online workout class, which many fitness companies are offering for free. Students can unwind with some  CorePower Yoga  from its website featuring free, on-demand workouts, or ramp up the burn with daily videos from interval-training gym  Orangetheory  without paying the membership price tag.     In addition, CNBC compiled a  comprehensive list of free exercises ,   from companies like  Peloton  and  Daily Burn .   These workouts could be done in the comfort of your own home, or even outside in a secluded patch of grass to get some fresh air.  Of course, art classes and workout sessions can't quite replace the fun of hanging out with friends. An app many Bruins are already familiar with may present a solution  Not only can they use  Zoom  for online lectures and professional meetings, but they can also use it as a platform to connect with friends.  Spencer Weissman, a fourth-year sociology student, has enjoyed keeping up with his buddies using the app.  ""One of the things I like to do to pass the time is watch obscure TV shows with my friends and then talk about it over Zoom afterward,"" Weissman said.  In addition to video-calling platforms, there are a number of applications that allow lonely students to connect with friends in different ways.  One such application is called  Psych! , which allows for a live, interactive game where players can anonymously answer questions, and the answers are then voted on by the other players.  Similarly, a website called  PlayingCards.io  offers an online version   similar to the popular card game,  Cards Against Humanity,  which up to six people can play.   Being able to play these games in real-time with friends can help diminish both loneliness and boredom.  Watching TV doesn't have to be boring, either  streaming ""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness"" has also become a lot more fun thanks to  Netflix Party , which allows users to watch content live with a friend. For those without a Netflix subscription,  Universal Pictures  is releasing its films online during the quarantine.   [Related:  The Quad: Sharing some good news amid the coronavirus pandemic ]   In addition to the entertainment listed above, some students stress the importance of staying active and maintaining a schedule while stuck at home.  For third-year molecular, cell and developmental biology   student Elana Weingord, a regular routine helps her get through the long days inside without getting cabin fever.  ""I think the most important thing is keeping a routine,"" Weingord said. ""Make plans when you wake up in the morning, and always get dressed.""  Weingord also said the best part of traveling home to Santa Cruz for the start of spring quarter is the availability of nature, which allows her to spend time at the beach or on hikes. She said the fresh air helps her to feel less cooped up, and the exercise curbs her boredom.  While most hiking trails and beaches in Los Angeles are closed, neighborhood parks or walks in residential areas are still a great way to get fresh air. According to LA officials, these activities are fine as long as folks  maintain their social distance .  Other students like Weissman, who is quarantined at his home in New York, find that focusing on classes has given them something more to do with their time. Weissman said he finds himself doing more schoolwork than usual just to keep himself busy.    Spending an indefinite amount of time in quarantine means finding unique and fun ways to stay stimulated. Video conferencing with friends will never feel like a substitute for a real hangout, but keeping ourselves and others safe during this time is paramount. Who knows  maybe you'll find a newfound appreciation for yoga or a knack for baking cookies.",['cap-alexa-greco'],"['lifestyle-quad', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/iphone.png

""Killing Eve"" isn't much without Eve &#8211; literally.    ""End of Game"" was already on shaky ground following a weak fifth episode centered solely on Villanelle's (Jodie Comer) backstory. But sadly Eve (Sandra Oh) remained mostly out of the picture as Villanelle continued her streak of disappointment as she realizes she will never have real power in the Twelve. After that unsatisfying awareness, the flamboyant serial killer reaches out to Konstantin (Kim Bodnia) for escape, but she is forced to acknowledge that she'll have to leave her lavish lifestyle and relationship with Eve behind. While the idea of Villanelle committing to a new life without Eve somewhat serves as the stakes the season has thus far been missing, it does little to make up for the physical absence of Eve.   [Related:    &#8216;Killing Eve&#8217; season 3 recap &#8211; episode 5: &#8216;Are You From Pinner?&#8217;   ]       As Villanelle grapples with her life-changing choices, the focus of the show redirects itself towards Niko (Owen McDonnell) who is hospitalized after the pitchfork incident in Poland   and angrily pushes Eve out of his life once again. Niko&#8217;s continuous presence on the show proves frustrating with his repetitive and essentially irrelevant role in the larger scheme of the show&#8217;s character dynamics, symbolizing Eve&#8217;s false hope of returning to normalcy. And to make matters worse, Eve maintains her long-standing faith in Villanelle despite signs pointing to her being Niko's attacker &#8211; a sentiment that contrasts   against Villanelle's decision to leave everything behind.  Despite the tiring push and pull of the Eve-Villanelle-Niko love triangle, ""Killing Eve"" does manage to remain faithful to Carolyn&#8217;s (Fiona Shaw) character revival as she continues her investigation into Kenny&#8217;s death. Upon discovering   the information sent to her by Vincent, her Scotland Yard contact, has been intercepted, she confronts MI6 supervisor   Paul (Steve Pemberton) about where his allegiances lie. While Carolyn and MI6 are often sarcastically portrayed   as poor excuses of government operatives, the underlying tension between the two serves as a reminder of their danger and capacity of betrayal and corruption to fulfil their own agenda.   [Related:    &#8216;Killing Eve&#8217; season 3 recap &#8211; episode 4: &#8216;Still Got It&#8217;   ]    On the other end of corruption, however, lies Konstantin&#8217;s daughter, Irina (Yuli Lagodinsky), who gained more prominence in this episode as she displayed her quick read of   Konstantin&#8217;s rapidly decaying good standing with the Twelve. But the real purpose of Irina&#8217;s increased presence this season &#8211; outside of showing Konstantin&#8217;s humanity &#8211; has yet to be revealed. But if the season so far has proven anything, it is that Irina is likely a plot device meant to hint at her father's redeemable qualities and provide some sort of stakes for his character.   In regard to humanity, the episode draws to an end with Villanelle hesitating to execute a target, forcing her to flee the scene with an injury. She takes refuge in Dasha&#8217;s restroom and admits in frustration that she wants out of her life as an assassin. Her character growth was made plausible with last week's episode painting an emotional portrait of Villanelle with her family, yet the development still comes off as a forced   endeavor   to humanize the serial killer as her newfound vulnerability and empathy comes on too strong, too fast.    What ""End of Game"" succeeded at in terms of subtly lived in costumes and set design, with Eve and Villanelle contrasted through their contending color schemes, hinting that as these characters come closer in contact, they remain worlds apart. Eve, dressed in dark, neutral colors and placed in bleaker, dirtier settings could only be described as diametrically opposed to Villanelle&#8217;s colorful outfits and elegant, lighter environments.  But while the visuals in &#8220;End Of Game&#8221; underlines Eve and Villanelle&#8217;s different paths, the episode's plot dragged on in a disjointed manner. The slow pacing and seemingly insignificant characters made it difficult to maintain interest in the larger story when so much time is being wasted on the show's minor notes of the show.   Despite the importance of Irina and Niko's role as a motivating factor for their respective loved ones, their characters don&#8217;t merit the amount of screen time dedicated to them as they grow ever more repetitive.  The episode&#8217;s focus on Villanelle and lack of screentime with Eve   did the plot a disservice, resulting in an unsatisfying lack of character nuance as the show continues to sideline its titular character.

Instead, the members of the squad memorialized the day with a Zoom call from their homes across the country.  ""It literally was one of the best days of my whole quarantine,"" said senior Kyla Ross. ""Just seeing everyone and having that celebration summed up the hard work and dedication we spent to get here. And even though we didnt get to end (the season) by competing, we were still somewhat together that day virtually, which was nice.""  Now, almost two months from finding out all NCAA sports would end the seasons because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Bruins have started to come to terms with the abrupt end to their season.  The gymnastics season ended just a week before the Bruins were slated to compete in the Pac-12 championship to kick off the postseason. Junior Kendal Poston said having come so close to the ultimate goal only for it to be cut short left her in limbo when she initially went home.  ""For me personally, I was so ready and gearing up for postseason,"" Poston said. ""I think that my team especially was so dialed into those feelings of being so close, so ready for the postseason and it was kind of an abrupt stop to those. So even when I got home I still felt like I had all this energy, and what was my purpose now?""  Coach Chris Waller, who was poised to take the Bruins back to the national championship in his first year as head coach, said when the team first heard the news, he and the coaching staff gathered the squad to talk through the upcoming days. He reminded the team that despite having been shut down just short of the finish line, it still had much to be proud of.  ""We met on that Saturday when we were supposed to be competing in our senior meet, and we reminisced about the year, and I pointed out to them that we didnt start the year with our only goal being to win a national championship,"" Waller said. ""That was the huge shining goal, but we started off the season by deciding to build the team based on trust, and to build something really special with our group of people. And we accomplished those two things.""  Most of the Bruins' nine seniors have therefore concluded their time with UCLA gymnastics, as the NCAA voted not to give winter athletes an extra year of eligibility. Ross is instead making plans to return to Westwood with the rest of the team next season as a student assistant coach.  Already planning on using a fifth year of study to complete her degree in molecular, cell and developmental biology, Ross said when Waller approached her with the opportunity to extend her time with gymnastics, she didn't hesitate to accept the coaching position.  ""Being a gymnast for the last 20 years, I feel like it would have been a really hard transition to just hang it up and be removed,"" Ross said. ""I think thats kind of helping me get through this weird time, is knowing that Im still able to come back to UCLA sometime next year, and be with the team as a coach. ... So just still having that connection to the sport and being able to inspire people through a different facet is something Im really excited for and looking forward to.""  For the Bruins who will be competing when next season starts, they've had to get creative with quarantine workouts to make up for the nationwide gym closures.  Poston said while any other year she'd be continuing her normal offseason workout routine, she's trying to enjoy the rare opportunity to explore other forms of exercise.  ""Ive picked up a lot more yoga, and Ive been going for runs as well. Normally, during competition season, I dont run just to prevent the extra strain on my body, but a lot of us are picking up new habits, new hobbies that we find joy in,"" Poston said. ""Thats a very special thing for a gymnast because, throughout our careers, we normally dont get more than a week away from the sport, so even though its unfortunate, ... were all finding a lot of joy in things we might never have pursued if this didnt happen.""  While what a 2021 gymnastics season would look like is still uncertain, Ross said she and the rest of the team are just trying to appreciate the small bright spots in the meantime, instead of focusing on what they missed out on.  ""My sister normally lives in Hawaii and shes back (home) too, and its been really cool. Weve been having a lot of family dinners, and that was kind of never the deal growing up because I was always at the gym,"" Ross said. ""So its kind of cool to have that, even if its under these crazy circumstances.""",['cap-coral-smith'],"['gymnastics', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.sp_.gym_.AB_8.jpeg

The revised budget would reduce higher education funding for the 2020-2021 fiscal year by 10% of current levels, in order to offset the rising costs associated with the coronavirus pandemic.  UC President Janet Napolitano said in a press release that the UC plans to continue working with the legislature to obtain additional funding.  &#8220;The University of California recognizes the unprecedented challenges California is facing in the wake of COVID-19 and regrets that Gov. (Gavin) Newsom was put into a position to steeply reduce the University&#8217;s budget in response to the State&#8217;s dramatically diminished revenues,&#8221; Napolitano said. &#8220;Regardless, UC stands with the governor and the legislature to help lift the State out of this economic crisis.&#8221;  However, the UC faces a financial loss of almost $1.2 billion from mid-March to April because of the pandemic.   [Related:    UC incurs over $500M in unexpected costs because of COVID-19   ]   Following the release of the new budget, the University announced that Napolitano and all 10 UC chancellors will be taking a voluntary 10%  pay cut  next year, and the UC will also be freezing salaries for nonunionized staff and nonstudent academic appointees.  UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook said in an emailed statement the University is also hoping the UC receives a larger state investment than the current proposal in the May budget revision, as well as some of the federal COVID-19 relief funding the state has received or may receive.  Holbrook added the UC is asking the state to approve a budget that keeps the UC&#8217;s general fund allocation at the levels set out in the Budget Act of 2019, which determined the state&#8217;s budget for the 2019-2020 fiscal year.  &#8220;We are requesting the State &#8211; to the greatest degree possible &#8211; provide UC with the resources to address lost revenues and increased costs,&#8221; Holbrook said in the statement. &#8220;We firmly believe that supporting UC at its ongoing funding levels of the 2019 Budget Act is critical for us to continue to meet our shared goals of access, affordability and academic quality.&#8221;  The UC is also looking at other ways to reduce expenses, such as by eliminating nonessential travel, Holbrook said.  UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez said in an emailed statement that since about 30% of UCLA&#8217;s core funding comes from the state, the proposed budget would result in a $50 million budget cut for UCLA alone.  The campus is currently planning how it will absorb the proposed budget cuts, Vazquez said.  &#8220;UCLA along with UC (Office of the President) and its sister campuses, will continue to advocate for and work with state and federal legislators to secure additional funding sources that can help us mitigate the financial challenges brought about by the pandemic,&#8221; he said in the statement.  States like California have to cut funds in response to recessions because they can&#8217;t acquire budget deficits by law, unlike the federal government, said Gary Orfield, a professor of education, law, political science and urban planning at UCLA.  &#8220;So the cuts are almost immediate, and they happened almost everywhere in the country,&#8221; Orfield said.  Higher education is particularly susceptible to budget cuts because of its ability to raise money using tuition increases, he added.  &#8220;You can't really cut health care,&#8221; Orfield said. &#8220;You can't cut prisons. ... Public schools don't get cut so much. But the higher (education) budget is especially hit because the higher (education) system has a way to recover money through raising tuition, which has typically happened during serious recessions.&#8221;  Despite such pressure to raise money, Holbrook said the UC is not currently considering a tuition increase.  Orfield also said he thinks California is luckier than other states currently because of the large reserve fund it had created prior to the pandemic.  &#8220;(Former) Gov. (Jerry) Brown and Gov. Newsom have been putting money away for an emergency, which means we have less drastic cuts than a number of other states that don't have any such cushion,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That won't last too long, of course, but it means that we're fortunate compared to most other states in that respect.&#8221;  Since the UC is a popular choice for prospective students, Orfield said he thinks the UC may not lose as many students as other colleges, which helps to maintain tuition revenue.  However, he added that since large university systems didn&#8217;t exist 100 years ago when the 1918 influenza pandemic hit, there is no precedent for how to handle the situation.  &#8220;We have almost no precedent in people's mind and they're making it up as they go along,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nobody knows the endpoint, so it's an enormous challenge to leadership. I think we have competent people who are thoughtful about it, but there's no simple solution.&#8221; ",['cap-julia-shapero'],"['higher-education', 'news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/5.29.news_.ucfundingcuts-01-1024x807.png

The 6-foot-9, 215-pound junior wing is coming off a breakout season in which he notched career-highs in every major traditional box-score statistic, including 13.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.4 blocks per game. His shooting percentages were also all career-highs as he shot 45.8% from the field, 34.1% from 3 and 84.0% from the charity stripe.  His development under coach Mick Cronin earned Smith the Pac-12 Most Improved Player award and a first-team All-Pac-12 selection.  If and when the Chicago native should expect to hear his name called on draft night is a point of debate. The Athletics Sam Vecenie has him as the No. 99 prospect on his big board, ESPN has him ranked No. 72 in its Top 100 and nbadraft.net has him projected to get picked No. 39 overall.  Smith's greatest draws as a prospect are his functional athleticism, projectable jump shot and defensive versatility.   Athleticism   Smith is the archetype of a prototypical, versatile, switchable wing that is in vogue in the modern NBA.  Similar to Los Angeles Laker forward Anthony Davis, Smith went through a major growth spurt in high school, growing nine inches between his freshman and sophomore year. As a result of the spurt, similar to Davis, Smith has the fundamentals and mechanics of a guard in a forwards frame. Simply put, Smiths potential mainly emanates from the fact that very few players can handle the ball, shoot the ball and move as well as Smith does at 6-foot-9 or taller.  Smith projects as a wing at the next level, offering spacing, secondary playmaking and a threat in transition on offense.  At his size and skillset, virtually every opponent guarding him is a mismatch. Most players his size are too slow to keep up with him on the perimeter, while he can take advantage of smaller players in the post by rising over them to shoot. He has the scoring repertoire in isolation that an NBA team could eventually count on to diversify its offense.  Smith has a lithe frame that he has added muscle to in his college years, but he still requires additional bulking to match up against some of the bruising power forwards in the NBA. He has already learned to use his length to impact the game on both ends of the court.     &nbsp;  Watch how Smith uses his wingspan to snatch the ball away from Colorados Tyler Bey, the Pac-12s defensive player of the year, and then use his length to elevate, draw contact and finish at the rim.  Cronin brought his half-court oriented style of play to UCLA from Cincinnati, changing the Bruins from the 19th fastest team in the country in terms of pace to the 306th in 2019-20. The lowered pace didnt give Smith as many opportunities to flaunt his physical gifts in transition and makes his per game statistics this season seem more ordinary than they are.   Shooting potential   A large reason Smith has progressed from a bench player his freshman year in Westwood to potential draft pick is his marked improvement shooting the ball.  His free throw percentage has appreciably improved each season  going from 58.5% to 71.9% to 84.0% in over his three years. He attributed his efficiency from the line to making 25 consecutive free throws daily, starting this past summer. His 3-point shooting mirrored the improvement from the line, increasing from 17.9% to 28.1% to 34.1%.  His shooting mechanics are sound and he has a high release point, which, combined with his height, means that he is rarely bothered by contests.     Smith utilizes his tight handle to put the defender on his heels and elevates for the 3. He has precise footwork and a simple, one-motion form with little wasted movement. A good portion of his 3-point attempts this season came off the dribble over closing out defenders.  Smith leans on his spin move to create separation in the mid-range. With UCLA down two with under two minutes to go against Arizona on Feb. 29, Cronin isolates Smith at the right elbow against 6-foot guard Max Hazzard. Smith sizes up the defender and uses his go-to move to create separation for the jumper.     Despite carrying the biggest offensive load of his collegiate career with a 25.3% usage rate, Smith posted his most efficient season with a 56.8% true shooting percentage. For comparison, projected top-five pick Anthony Edwards had a 30.4% usage rate combined with a 52.0% true shooting percentage.  Smith's offensive success came despite a lack of outside shooting around him. Outside of Smith, UCLA shot 32.0% from behind the arc, which would rank second-last in the Pac-12.   Defensive versatility   NBA teams will be pleased with the defense-first mentality Cronin has used to mold Smith. Early in the season, Cronin demanded more intensity from Smith and characterized the juniors personality as laid back. Smith was prone to bouts of lapses in focus on the defensive end earlier in the season, but shored up some of those issues as the year moved along. At times this season, Smith was the tallest Bruin on the floor and switched competently defensively onto every position 1 through 5.       Smith showcases his foot speed and discipline by keeping up with the guard on the perimeter and not reaching. The guard does little to lose Smith and attempts a layup that Smith is able to easily swat off the backboard due to his positioning.   Player comparisons: Pascal Siakam, Cam Reddish   Smiths wiry frame resembles Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakams. The 6-foot-9 Siakam, who was drafted 27th overall in 2016, improved his 3-point shooting from 14.3% his rookie season to 36.9% in his third year, comparable to Smiths shooting development.  Siakam plays a perimeter-oriented game, using his handle, length and quickness to his advantage and finish over opponents at the rim. He has gotten more confident in his 3-ball and less hesitant to pull the trigger from deep off the dribble. Siakam also has developed his post game which he uses to attack mismatches.  While Smith's ceiling may not approach Siakam's All-Star stat line of 23.6 points and 7.6 rebounds per game, their similar playstyles and versatility are enough to warrant comparison.  Atlanta Hawks forward Cam Reddish  who is just two months older than Smith  plays a role that Smith could fill at the start of his NBA career as well, albeit with more minutes than the Bruin will likely earn in his rookie year. Reddish primarily spaces the floor on offense and is asked to guard multiple positions on the defensive end.  Reddish quite rarely creates offense for himself and is more of a play finisher, as 86.7% of his 3-point goals were assisted. Smith has shown the ability to spot-up, play effectively off the ball and defend guards and wings just like the former Blue Devil.  Usually NBA teams only gamble on upperclassmen in the draft when the production is just too much to ignore. This isnt the case with Smith, but he makes up for it with theoretical untapped potential and his young age for a junior due to skipping the second grade.  Having just turned 20 in December, Smith is younger than freshman Memphis forward Precious Achiuwa, a projected borderline lottery pick.  The junior guard also proved to be durable playing in every game in his collegiate career.  Smith's unique blend of athleticism and potential make him an intriguing case study and show that there is pro potential there, but his lack of a completely filled out frame hints that there is more room to grow.  Smith certainly seems NBA-bound, but another year of seasoning under Cronins tutelage could prove more beneficial than a year that would most likely involve lengthy stints, if not a season-long stay, in the G-League.",['cap-dylan-dsouza'],"['mens-basketball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/1..jpg

The event, which was livestreamed and viewed by nearly 2,000 people, took place in De Neve Auditorium. However, students were encouraged to not attend in person, so about 15 were physically present. The audience asked UCLA experts and campus representatives questions via livestream and in person.  Three students were tested for the coronavirus as of Friday, but all three tests came back negative, according to an emailed statement from Chancellor Gene Block.  Addressing COVID-19 has been complex because the disease and its effects keep evolving, said Sam Elias, associate medical director of the UCLA Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center.  This condition didnt exist three months ago, and now its everywhere,"" Elias said.  As of Monday, there were 16 cases of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County. Two cases were reported Monday. One patient had been to Japan while the second has an unidentified source of exposure, according to  a Los Angeles County Department of Public Health statement .  As a result, the LACDPH has ruled it to be the first possible case of community transmission in LA County, according to the statement.  UC Berkeley, USC and Stanford University have all moved classes online.  Health and Prevention:    	 Students are encouraged to virtually reach out to the Ashe Center if they experience any symptoms, Elias said.   	 The center is available for all students, whether they have the UC Student Health Insurance Plan or not, Elias said.   	 The Ashe Center has a security guard at its entrance to monitor the symptoms of any individuals visiting the center, Elias said. If anyone appears to have COVID-19 symptoms, they will enter through a separate entryway, he added.   	 Nurses and frontline workers are equipped with protective gear, such as gowns, goggles and masks, should they be needed, Elias said.   	 Isolation and quarantine are the two principal methods public health officials employ when it comes to highly communicable diseases like COVID-19, Elias said. Isolation is for patients with the disease and quarantine is for individuals who are healthy but have been exposed to those with the disease.   	 Peter Angelis, assistant vice chancellor for UCLA Housing and Hospitality Services, said UCLA Housing has additional space for isolation and is prepared to accommodate up to 500 people if necessary.   	 Elias also said the term person under investigation refers to someone who exhibits risks and symptoms but has not been tested and therefore cannot be known to have the disease.   	 People with a travel history are more likely to contract the disease, Elias said.   	 Elias said the UCLA medical center is working on developing test kits for the coronavirus.    Academics and Student Life:    	 UCLA is evaluating all large-scale events, including graduation, to see if they will carry on as planned despite the spread of the coronavirus, Dean of Students Maria Blandizzi said.   	 Jaime Balboa, assistant vice provost for summer sessions and study abroad and assistant dean for Undergraduate Education at UCLA, said summer UC Education Abroad Program classes in China have been canceled. The status of other programs is contingent on how the COVID-19 situation evolves, he added.   	 Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Development Suzanne Seplow said other campuses that have switched to online classes have not shut down their campuses.   	 Angelis said if classes are proceeding as planned, then custodial services, residential operations and dining operations will operate normally as well.    Resources:    	 Blandizzi said students experiencing anxiety because of the circumstances can reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services. She also said students who have experienced bias because of their nationality can submit a report on the Office of the Dean of Students'  website .   	 Blandizzi also said students who are registered with the Center for Accessible for Education and think COVID-19 might impact an existing condition can reach out to the center with any concerns.   	 The Ashe Center will be open during spring break and has masks available for students who are sick. However, sick students are advised to stay at home. Those who do not have symptoms do not need to wear masks to class, Elias said.   	 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has guidelines on travel which students can adhere to before and during spring break, Seplow said.

But recently, the voice of the student body has largely been composed of Twitter rants and screenshot exposes.  Tensions between Undergraduate Students Association Council members have boiled over into the public social media sphere over the Cultivating Unity for Bruins Referendum, a proposed referendum on the upcoming USAC election ballot.  But the hostilities didnt begin with CUB  and they wont end there if USAC doesnt change.  USAC officers have blatantly attacked one another on Twitter and leaked several COVID-19 related announcements before university administration was prepared to release them. Theyve chastised students skeptical of their $10,000 stipends in public group chats.  But considering the size of that stipend, students have every right to expect more than social media clapbacks and Twitter feuds.  USAC officers are paid by student fees to responsibly and professionally run a public office  and its time they start acting like it on social media. Just like in any other public entity, USAC officers must be held to a certain standard of conduct, and considering past behavior, it has become increasingly clear that individual officeholders will not change on their own accord. As such, the council must officially codify rules regarding social media etiquette moving forward, so as to ensure the fees of students are being put toward innovation and solutions, not petty fights and Facebook rants.  USAC wants students to believe that their roles and words hold legitimate power  and they have the potential to. But when the behavior of individuals gets in the way of that common goal, representatives must realize the part they have to play in diminishing their own reputation.  Not to mention, theres precedent for codifying social media etiquette. Courts have  ruled  that public officials cant block critics on social media. Many states have  social media policy guidelines  for legislators. If USAC wants to play the role of public official, it needs to hold itself to the same standards as the rest.  The election code has one line about social media behavior, reminding campaigning candidates to be respectful of others and remain positive. That might cut it for students running a campaign  but once theyre in office with $10,000 in hand, the True Bruin Values wont cut it as a social media guideline.  Sure, social media is important for USAC officers who are public representatives. But this isnt about taking them off social media  its about changing how they use it. Students have long complained of toxicity that penetrates the council and its meetings  Robert Watson himself has denounced that toxicity. But by using his platform to attack other USAC officers, he only shows the rest of his council that such attacks are fair game.  During election season especially, USAC officials need to take the energy they're now putting into Twitter roasts and use it to encourage voter turnout and facilitate better remote student engagement.  Theres a reason only about 16% of students voted in the last USAC election  its because its members arent great at showing students why they should be trusted. Clear and official social media policies might help.  Otherwise, USAC will just continue to drive students away.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/USACsocialJPEG.jpg

Several USAC offices allocated their remaining budgets to the COVID-19 Relief Fund, contributing $100,000 total, said Millen Srivastava, Financial Supports commissioner and chair of the committee overseeing the fund.  When classes moved online and the true colors of this global pandemic were apparent, FSC and USAC knew that the financial insecurity of students would increase in unimaginable ways, Srivastava said.  Because the FSC has one of the smallest budgets in USAC, Srivastava approached the other members of council and asked for them to collaborate on creating the relief fund so they could collectively help as many students as possible.  Twelve out of 15 offices and entities donated to the relief fund. These offices and entities are composed of the offices of the president, the internal vice president, the external vice president, the transfer student representative, the international student representative, and all of the three general representatives, as well as the Community Service Commission, Campus Events Commission, Facilities Commission, Financial Supports Commission.  Application information can be found on the USAC Facebook page.  The Student Wellness Commission is also running a separate relief program, said Student Wellness Commissioner Mihika Sridhar.  The SWC's COVID-19 Student Relief Grant is available to all undergraduate students to apply for until May 4. The goals of this grant are similar to the goals of the USAC COVID-19 Relief Fund, as both programs aim to assist students who are in need of financial assistance because of the pandemic.  Neither of the relief funds are related to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, as USAC did not receive any money from the CARES Act. However, UCLA did receive more than $30 million in federal funding from the CARES Act.  The $2 trillion relief package was passed by President Donald Trump in order to assist individuals and businesses impacted by the coronavirus. Under the CARES Act, higher education institutions are given relief to provide emergency financial aid grants to students for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus.  The USAC COVID-19 Relief Fund Committee hopes to allocate these $500 awards in the most equitable way possible, Srivastava said. Names, university IDs and emails will be hidden from the committee to preserve the anonymity of applicants when decisions on their applications are made.  The COVID-19 Relief Fund has currently received around 1,500 applications, and the committee expects it to have 500 more by the time it closes May 1. Because of this, the committee will most likely only be able to provide 10%-15% of applicants with the $500 award.  Several USAC members and members of the USAC COVID-19 Relief Fund Committee said they think there is an urgency for the grants.  Marginalized communities on our campus are going to be disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus, said General Representative 3 Brandon Broukhim. Its really important to help those communities.  Facilities Commissioner Lily Shaw said now, more than ever, students need to come together and help one another.  I am so thankful that my fellow council members and I were able to reallocate our budgets in a meaningful way, Shaw said. While the USAC COVID-19 fund is only a small fraction of relief for students, I am hopeful that organizations and administration will join us in providing various forms of support for students in need.",['cap-christina-williams'],"['campus', 'news', 'student-government']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ns_.usacrelieffund.file_.jpg

The Australian band&#8217;s fourth studio album, released Friday, explores a vivacious but heated relationship over the course of 12 tracks. Sonically, the band has fully left behind its pop-punk roots for polished lyrics and a darker take on pop music. At times solemn and introspective, &#8220;CALM&#8221; offers emotionally honest lyrics that are often obscured by heavy production   and sonic repetition. Once that is stripped away, however, 5 Seconds of Summer offers a pensive reflection in the album's quieter moments.  &#8220;Red Desert&#8221; provides a strong opening, featuring minimal guitar and smooth harmonies. The instrumentals increase throughout the song, expertly layering intense drumming and harmonies as the whole band sings &#8220;Red, red desert, heal our blues,"" establishing the album&#8217;s central concept of using love as a healing force. Drummer Ashton Irwin&#8217;s skills shine as the song&#8217;s backbone that energetically builds to the ending's stripped-back vocals.  The second track and third single, &#8220;No Shame,  &#8221; continues the album&#8217;s groovy atmosphere, relying heavily on the much-repeated chorus to carry the upbeat song. But as the LP progresses, it becomes clear that 5 Seconds of Summer depends   on the same sonic structure to carry almost every track. &#8220;Old Me&#8221; and &#8220;Easier&#8221; identically utilize a slow beginning followed by sudden swelling rhythm partway into each song.   The heavy production throughout ""Old Me"" in particular overshadows introspective lyrics as the song introduces the recurring concept of knowing oneself. In the same vein, these first four songs strip back the vocals in their respective endings, allowing the smooth vocals in each one to stand out. But while the trick works every once in a while,   its overuse   makes it little more than a gimmick.    [Related:    Album review: Halsey takes listeners on her emotional, self-reflective journey in &#8216;Manic&#8217;   ]     Following this sonic monotony, &#8220;Teeth&#8221; comes as a breath of fresh air. The album&#8217;s second single features an intermittently halting beat and restrained falsetto that culminate in what could be gaudy but is instead a foreboding pop song. With its bouncy techno beat and enticing repetition, ""Teeth"" succeeds in the same places &#8220;Easier&#8221; fails. The refrain of &#8220;Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth&#8221; expertly establishes a darker tone without sacrificing the song's pop integrity.  But &#8220;Wildflower,&#8221; the album's fifth single, returns to the previous idealistic tones with a pop anthem. This time, however, that idealism is paired with an underlying darker spirit. The song steadily gains  momentum as it highlights small details like hair falling over a shoulder &#8211; but this love is &#8220;fatal.&#8221;   It is this subtle juxtaposition between the seemingly happy love song and the underlying despair that elevates the track.  That somber tone intensifies in &#8220;Not In The Same Way.&#8221; Though still utilizing the same animated beat as a number of the previous songs, it marks a shift in the album as the band leans into the theme of sadness. As lead vocalist Luke Hemmings sings &#8220;On the floor, watch me bleed,&#8221; the song provides a clear culmination of the danger in &#8220;Teeth&#8221; and the fatalism in &#8220;Wildflower,"" and these subtle threads provide the LP with understated depth.  The song seamlessly transitions into the lyrical powerhouse &#8220;Lover Of Mine&#8221; as Hemmings and bassist Calum Hood layer their vocals for the chorus, singing &#8220;When I take a look at my life and all of my crimes/ You're the only thing that I think I got right.&#8221; In stripping away the intense production from the earlier songs, ""Lover of Mine"" can truly stand out, allowing both the wistful lyrics and the light instrumentals to shine.    [Related:    Album review: &#8216;FANDOM&#8217; creates diverse sounds to show true nature of rising fame   ]   Accentuating their woes with the album's final three songs, &#8220;Thin White Lies&#8221; perfectly balances plucky guitar strums with distant shouts as Hemmings ends the song with the haunting proclamation, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really like me anymore.&#8221; The sorrow continues in &#8220;Lonely Heart,&#8221; a sweet yet somber track that has the narrator desperately lamenting his &#8220;lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely/ Heart.&#8221; Here, the repetition doesn&#8217;t feel like a lyrical cop-out; instead, it comes across as authentically pleading.  As the relationship traced throughout ""CALM""   has clearly come to an end, &#8220;High&#8221; grapples with   becoming a better person, whether for oneself or someone else. Hemmings and Hood harmonize in the pre-chorus, singing &#8220;I need to stop letting me down&#8221; while the background vocals croon. A stark change in tone from the previous radio hits, the slow tempo of ""High"" ends the album on a much sadder note. Here, the reverberating guitar chords and light synths conclude on an achingly honest note.  Such sincerity is what saves ""CALM"" from being completely overcome by peppy beats and heavy production. And when the sadness does seep through, it's clear that all 5 Seconds of Summer wants is a little emotional tranquility.

However, there is one event hiatus that no high school student will bemoan &#8211; the cancellation of college entrance exams.  The College Board canceled the SAT originally scheduled for May 2, and although the June 6 edition of the SAT is still currently proceeding as planned, every day the country remains on lockdown decreases the likelihood that the exam will take place.  The University of California system has decided to circumvent the problem of canceled exams altogether. In a press  release  from April 1, the coalition of campuses announced that it will forgo the standardized testing requirements for fall 2021 freshman applicants.  But what high schoolers want to do and what they need to do aren't always aligned &#8211; and the UC should know that better than anyone.   The world is facing an unprecedented event and many people are experiencing uncertainty in their everyday lives.   But removing standardized testing from admissions requirements for a year will, if anything, only add to that uncertainty.   Standardized testing is an essential aspect of the admissions process that could easily be converted to an online format to preserve the integrity of UC admissions.  UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez said in an emailed statement that the UC admissions process uses Comprehensive Review, 14 faculty-approved  criteria , to consider applicants holistically.   &#8220;If a student does not submit standardized test scores, readers will evaluate students based on the other thirteen elements of the application,"" Vazquez said in the statement.  The UC-wide decision to waive the standardized testing requirement provides another avenue for implicit bias to sneak in, potentially helping students who have already taken standardized tests over their fellow applicants.   These students will have a more complete application and, in a time when many students won&#8217;t even have an SAT or ACT score to tout, those who do could appear more proactive than the applicants who waited to take tests that are now canceled.  Beyond that, the admissions criteria doesn&#8217;t provide a comprehensive way to compare students who attend different schools. An admissions officer can look at GPA and coursework, but curriculums and grading scales differ from school to school.  Entrance essays level the playing field in the same way standardized tests do, but they provide an extremely polished and revised version of an applicant. An equalizing standardized test can be retaken and improved upon, but cannot be touched up by revisionists and overly helpful high school teachers.   The UC system couldn&#8217;t come up with a new category to replace standardized testing because there isn&#8217;t one. And with no end in sight to social distancing, it&#8217;s time for the College Board to begin moving the test online.  The  software  to mitigate cheating on these exams already exists. Not to mention, higher level standardized tests like the LSAT and GRE already exist in an online format.  Moving the test online could affect access, but the digital age has put some sort of device in almost every hand in the United States. According to Pew Research Center polling  data  from 2019, 74% of American adults have a desktop or laptop computer of some kind. And with all that money saved on pen and paper test-taking materials, the College Board could direct funding toward providing technology loans or grants for students without access.  It's unlikely that test scores would be affected by the move online either.   Li Cai, the director of the National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing and professor at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, said that, while not conclusive, some studies have shown that the difference between in-person test scores and online test scores is very slim.  &#8220;In some cases, there were studies suggesting that these delivery mode differences are negligible, and indeed, based on that, many of the assessment programs have moved entirely online,"" Cai said.  With tests and testing platforms already moving online to keep up with the digital age, doing the same with the SAT isn&#8217;t just a temporary fix.  Instead, it could be a move toward the future of testing &#8211; one in which students could take the exam on their own schedule in a comfortable environment  .  Some students believe that standardized tests shouldn&#8217;t just be put on hold but permanently eradicated altogether.  Alaire Kanes, a first-year undeclared student, saw the effect social inequality had on her peers' scores during high school.  &#8220;If kids and their parents could afford tutoring, then they were destined to do pretty well on tests like the ACT and the SAT,&#8221; Kanes said.  Kanes isn&#8217;t wrong. Income does  affect  SAT and ACT scores, and a person with money can pay for better tutoring, which leads to better results. Especially in the current economic climate, tests geared toward higher-income students seem increasingly unfair.  This doesn&#8217;t just end with standardized testing, though. Parents with higher incomes can also afford to pay for private tutors. Higher-income students can participate in more extracurriculars, while their disadvantaged classmates may need to work a job to support their families. The entire college admissions process, not just the standardized testing portion, gives students with higher incomes an advantage.  The fact still stands that standardized tests help admissions officers distinguish between candidates. They are an important part of the process, and such highly criticized flaws are only a symptom of the larger inequalities in our public education system.  But until a complete overhaul of inequities in higher education comes along, standardized testing should be here to stay.

Gavin Newsom ordered California residents to stay at home unless necessary at a Thursday press conference.  Newsom signed the order banning all public gatherings to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus in the state.  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia and Pasadena Mayor Terry Tornek made similar Safer at Home orders for Los Angeles County, likewise telling residents to stay at home through at least April 19.  The LA County Department of Public Health also updated the county order Saturday to match the stricter statewide order, banning public and private gatherings of any size.  The governor and mayors asked that residents not leave their homes unless necessary.  I dont believe that the people of California need to be told through law enforcement that its appropriate to home isolate, protect themselves, go about the essential, essential patterns of life but do so by socially distancing themselves from others and ... using their common sense, Newsom said.  Garcettis order for Los Angeles, which went into effect at 11:59 p.m. Thursday, is not a lockdown measure, the mayor said. Los Angeles County residents will be able to get groceries, seek medical care and take walks around the neighborhood.  All noncritical in-person business operations must also close.  Businesses under one of the 16 federally defined  critical infrastructure sectors , including hospitals, banks, groceries and news media, will be allowed to remain open through both state and county orders. Those that continue to operate must adhere to social distancing and hygiene guidelines, including providing customers with hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.  If we can slow the spread, we can buy days, Garcetti said. And when we buy those days that means that we can get ventilators. And we can get beds and kits and masks and tests, and this will save lives.  The orders come after six Bay Area counties announced shelter in place orders Monday, keeping San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Contra Costa and Alameda counties' residents home until at least April 7.",['cap-jhan'],"['california', 'los-angeles', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/hz.ns_.proposedbudget.file_.jpg

Her professor, who doesnt allow electronics in class, had been talking for the past 20 minutes about why he didnt want to hold finals online. Suddenly, to the professors suspicion, the entire lecture hall started to giggle.  Some girl kind of outed herself, and she was like, Oh, you know, you kind of have to have your finals online this quarter, sorry, said Naziri, an international development studies student. At first it was kind of funny, but now like two seconds later, it dawned on me, like, 'Oh wow, all of my friends are going to leave and I might not see many of them again for a long time.'  The new coronavirus outbreak began in December. The highly contagious virus, which has already killed  almost 10,000 people  worldwide as of March 19, is most dangerous for elderly people or people who are immunocompromised.  UCLA announced March 10 that, to limit the spread of the coronavirus, all winter quarter finals and the first two weeks of spring quarter classes would be conducted online.  Three days later, UCLA extended the change until the end of the school year. The school encouraged students to pack their belongings and leave campus. That same day, Grant Mooney, a fourth-year sociology student, formed UCLA Seniors on GroupMe. More than 2,000 students joined over the next few days.  For thousands of fourth years and their friends, life has begun to feel much more uncertain.  (When I heard spring quarter was moving online) I didn't get to the point of tears, but I almost did, said Daniel Robertson, a fourth-year history and sociology student. The feelings that I had going in my chest were like I got out of a nasty breakup or something  like a rock in your stomach, Naziri interjected.            Leaving friends behind   In the frenzy of moving out so quickly, Abdullah Nasir lost his chance to say goodbye to his friend Jonathan.  Nasirs friend had been offered a free ride to his home city of Sacramento, but only had one day to pack his belongings.  So that was completely devastating because ... he texts me like, Yeah, I really want to say bye to you, and then I was like, Hey, I cant because Im in the middle of figuring everything out (myself), said Nasir, a fourth-year anthropology and geography student. Then like two days later, I realized that he had left, and now I was extremely sad.  Michael Schwartz, a fourth-year electrical engineering student, was with his girlfriend when the news broke. His girlfriends father had sent her a ticket for an 8 a.m. flight home the following day.  Schwartz realized he wasnt going to be able to see his girlfriend for the rest of the quarter, and possibly longer.  In the chaos, seniors never got a real chance to say goodbye to their friends and their school, said Clara Nguyen, a fourth-year Asian American studies and human biology and society and student.  I just wish there was more for us to feel like we're actually being able to say goodbye, Nguyen said. I think that was never really an option for us.  By Saturday, students were already packing up and leaving campus. Several seniors had gone already, expecting to be back by April 10, the universitys original end  date  for online learning.  Some had said goodbye to their friends only days ago, not realizing it might have been the last time theyd ever see them.  Fourth-year neuroscience student Dina Dowlat, went home last week expecting to return by April 10 but decided to stay when UCLA moved online for the rest of the year. The rest of her friend group are third and second years, and will be back at UCLA next year.  They know that theyll see each other again, even if they move home (for spring quarter), but they probably would not likely see me again at school, Dowlat said.  Dowlat would never get another chance to have brunch at Bruin Plate with her friends. Nor would they ever get their weekly Tuesday night dinners together again.  Last week, the group went to Pizookie night at BJs, Dowlat said.  Oh yeah, Dowlat said in dawning realization. Thats the last time I saw them.                      Leaving a community, too   Kenisha Liu, a fourth-year history student, was waiting in J.D. Morgan Center to see her academic advisor when she got the phone call from her swim coach.  Her coach was busy at a meet with some of the other athletes, so Liu knew it couldnt be good news.  The rest of the swim season was canceled, Lius coach told her.  At first, Liu was relieved. She had been nervous about the important final senior meet because of the high expectations that come with it.  Then it really hit me, what it means, Liu said. I can't have this last meet; with my team that I love so much, that (I) spent four years swimming for.  For some fourth years, leaving UCLA meant losing their last experiences of being in Los Angeles.  Nguyen and her friend Jared had anticipated exploring LA to hang out and study. When they heard the news, theyd just arrived at the Santa Monica Capital One Caf to find it closed because of special operating hours.  Losing a quarter is especially impactful for transfer students, who only had six quarters at UCLA to begin with, said Luke Cooper, a fourth-year history transfer student. Hed already only had two years to make a four-year experience.  Cooper said he felt defeated by the news that spring quarter would be online. Having only just settled after a difficult transition from a rural community, he felt uprooted once more.  I finally started making a home out of it, Cooper said. You know, I actually have roots here, people that I love and my own social group that was all my own. And I thought that I would have one last quarter to say goodbye to it all.           ""Press G to graduate""   One of the most common concerns among seniors was the possibility that graduation would be canceled, like UC Irvines was last week.  On Wednesday, their fears seemed to come to pass. Although the primary commencement ceremony wasnt canceled outright, Chancellor Gene Block announced all spring graduation ceremonies would be moved online.  Within minutes, it was clear on the GroupMe and Twitter that many fourth years were unhappy. The hashtags #uclapostpone and #postponegrad began trending on Twitter. Multiple petitions to postpone the ceremony, instead of moving it online, circulated the social networks.  Many students felt an online commencement was not enough.  An online commencement is not a commencement, Robertson said.  Fourth-year history student Solomon Eibensteiner skipped his high school graduation ceremony to go skydiving, so he was looking forward to walking across the stage in college.  Every time I thought about (graduation), I would just get a sense of giddy joy, said Eibensteiner. And its just like, super exciting. And since thats now on the line, Im just like, OK, thats going to get stolen. And it really hurts.  After the news sent shockwaves through Twitter and GroupMe, UCLA administration announced it would poll 2020 graduating students on MyUCLA. The poll is seeking seniors input on potentially holding an in-person commencement during the 2020-2021 academic year, in addition to the spring virtual ceremony.  Four graduating seniors, members of the co-ed transfer student fraternity Chi Alpha Psi, refused to accept graduation could be canceled or held online.  Calling themselves The Peoples Commencement, they are planning a student-run ceremony for fourth years at Santa Monica beach June 12. Cooper, who is one of the organizers of the event, said the idea came up at a hangout at Broxton in Westwood.  After initially envisioning a small party for their close friends, Cooper said they asked themselves, What if we invited the whole school?  It was too painful to imagine never having the chance to interact with friends and professors again, Robertson, another organizer, said.  (This situation) kind of makes us want to, change it, ... and we want to take it in our own hands and do something fun, Robertson said.  Naziri, who is also an organizer, said they are aware of the risk of coronavirus transmission in group events. The organizers, the last of whom is Tobias Cheng, a fourth-year psychology student, are planning to discuss potential safety measures with public health officials.  However, last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all gatherings of over 250 people to be canceled or postponed. UCLA took restrictions even further Monday, suspending all nonessential gatherings of any size.  If The Peoples Commencement is banned by public health officials, the event would be canceled, said Robertson.  On the other hand, after spring quarter classes moved online, some fourth-year students said they might as well graduate early.  Rosemary Wallace, a fourth-year environmental studies student, said some of her friends even changed their degree to finish this quarter.  I ended up deciding to graduate this (winter) quarter because Im done with my major, but I (had) wanted to stay another quarter just to take some fun classes, Wallace said. But you know, whats the point of doing that if its (just) going to be online?  Wallace said she had been looking forward to staying involved in club activities. With everything canceled, though, she has no more reason to remain at UCLA.  &nbsp;                         Were all in this together   Despite all the trouble caused by the transition to online classes, one student, Matthew Carter, knows thousands of others are going through the same thing.  As much as we are self-quarantined and we are quite literally alone, I really do feel like were not alone in this, Carter, a fourth-year geography/environmental studies student said. There are 10,000 other seniors who are experiencing exactly what Im experiencing.  The night classes moved online, Mooney began the UCLA Seniors GroupMe chat with several friends.  Add ANY senior you know, Mooney typed as the first message in the chat. The group currently has about 2,500 members.  The fourth years have used it for many purposes: to pass around petitions and share information, lend each other support and gather resources for their fellow classmates. But most importantly, theyve used it to draw closer together, as they move farther apart.   All messages featured in the article were used with the permission of their authors.

When she leaves, which she only does to get food or take out her trash, she is surrounded by an empty, quiet Hill.  On Mattie Greens floor in Rieber Hall, only around four students remain, Green said.  Hasan Masud doesnt see many people either, other than the occasional meetup to stand in line to get food together, 6 feet apart.  It's lonely, said Xiao, a resident assistant for Rieber Hall and a second-year ecology, behavior and evolution student. All my friends are not here anymore.  Xiao, Green and Masud are part of the minority of students who opted to remain in residence halls. More than 80% canceled their housing contracts and left after classes moved online for spring quarter.  Many operations have been limited on the Hill in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and student life has changed as a result.  Among the changes, dining options have been limited to De Neve Residential Restaurant and Rendezvous, with Feast at Rieber to replace Rendezvous next week. All meals are takeout, and residents are instructed to stand 6 feet apart in line with a mask on as they wait for their food.  Rieber Hall has the only operating front desk on the Hill. However, the swipe system has remained the same, and vending machines still work.  Xiao said food options are lacking, especially for her vegetarian diet.  Theres no way to keep a healthy diet on the Hill right now, its been really bad, Xiao said. Im vegetarian and its really hard to get vegetables.  Green, a third-year mechanical engineering student, has had to supplement her diet with groceries while living on the Hill.  When I came back to the Hill and I tried to get food, I had a feeling of anxiety because there were just no vegetables anywhere, Green said. Before, I didnt really buy any food from the grocery store except for snacks, but I had to get myself some fresh produce that Ive been eating.  Lines for the grocery stores in Westwood are much longer than usual, and students must wear masks to enter.  When we went to Trader Joe's, there was a huge line all across the parking lot, Xiao said. ""There's no way we wanted to go in that line.  [caption id=""attachment_378490"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    In accordance with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's mandate, LA residents are required to wear cloth face coverings while working or shopping at nonmedical essential businesses. (Jintak Han/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Many bathrooms on the Hill have been shut down as well. Five bathrooms were left open in all of Rieber Hall out of the total 25, Xiao said, making most residents have to take an elevator trip to use the bathroom. Rieber Hall bathrooms were left uncleaned for two days during spring break as well. UCLA Residential Life professional staff said housekeeping operations had been understaffed during that week in a recent Zoom town hall.  I had two residents complaining about the bathrooms not having been cleaned, Xiao said. Although they moved the bathrooms to one floor per building, it still takes them a long time to move throughout the Hill.  There has also been an increased amount of people experiencing homelessness staying on the Hill, with university police having received double the amount of calls to escort nonstudents off the Hill compared to last month, according to UCPD.  Xiao, as a Hill employee, encountered one woman experiencing homelessness who spent two days in the Rieber Hall 3 South lounge before being escorted off campus by UCPD. This was the second time she had been escorted off the hill in a week, Xiao said.  I saw her for like two days just sitting in the lounge. I was curious and asked if she is a resident but she said shes homeless because of the pandemic and had nowhere to go and that she wanted me to keep her as a secret, Xiao said. I feel so sorry about this but I had to report it and call my supervisor.  UCLA Housing has been working on consolidating residents into fewer buildings so that residents are not as spread out, with the goal of giving each resident their own room. Residents in De Neve residence halls were transferred completely to Sunset Village over the weekend.  This was done to make space for possible hospital overflow from patients as well as housing for doctors, according to ResLife professional staff in the Zoom town hall meeting.  Masud, a Dykstra Hall RA and fourth-year applied mathematics student, said that he and his residents were given notice Thursday that they had to be moved out by Sunday.  There was a lot of complication, Masud said. As an international student of four years, I have all my stuff with me, so it was a harrowing process to pack up. I almost got moved into a room that someone was already living in.  Masud said that residents now have single rooms and single or shared bathrooms after the move, which he thinks is beneficial for safety and made the move worth it.  UCLA Housing plans to continue consolidating all residents into Sunset Village, Rieber Terrace, Rieber Vista and Hedrick Summit in the following weekends.  [caption id=""attachment_378491"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Students from other parts of the Hill have either moved into or will move into Sunset Village, Rieber Terrace, Rieber Vista or Hedrick Summit over the coming weekends. (Daily Bruin file photo)[/caption]  Xiao and Masud, like many other international students, had little choice but to stay on the Hill.  Xiao is an international student from China and said that her reasons for staying are complex. Although she has the option to go home, flights are limited, and she would face a mandatory two-week quarantine once she returned.  A lot of new cases in China are found to be people coming back from foreign countries,"" Xiao said. I guess thats why a lot of us are scared to go home and part of the reason why a lot are staying.  Other residents have different reasons for choosing to stay. Green said that she returned to the Hill to better focus on her studies and have her own space.  I didnt feel like I could be in a school mindset at home, Green said. My family is six people, which is a lot for a house. I needed my own space, and I wanted to be closer to my friends.  Student employment on the Hill has also been affected by the pandemic. Many RAs have resigned and moved home, and other students in ResLife positions have been given the option to either work remotely or receive three weeks of paid administrative leave.  Some RAs are frustrated with swiftly changing protocols, Masud said.  We just keep getting these update emails that are confusing, contradict themselves and go back on things, Masud said. I think we're asking questions that they still don't know the answers to, and that's why we don't have the information. It's not like they're withholding information, its that they genuinely do not know. I think we can give them the benefit of the doubt. This is a situation that no one has ever had to deal with.  Masuds advice for everyone still on the Hill like him is to be understanding in this time of unprecedented circumstances.  Its easy to get frustrated, but just understand that everyone is trying to deal with it, Masud said. We just have to get on with it and try and do our best.",['cap-abby-thomas'],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/aloneonthehill.Jhan_.jpg

(Aimee Benitez)    As of now, UCLA is planning to offer students the option of remote instruction in the fall, even if some classes are held in person. The university has not yet decided to take the entire quarter online for all students. On-campus housing is also currently not guaranteed for any students, including incoming freshmen, and the administration aims to extend the remote instruction option if it cannot fulfill housing requests.    The university has also assembled a Future Planning Task Force dedicated to making recommendations about academics, student experience, housing and more as the pandemic continues.        Can students working on campus get hazard pay? (@lissxette)     Information on whether or not student workers on campus are getting hazard pay is currently not available at this time.        Is take-out/delivery food safe? Can coronavirus be transmitted by ingestion? (@cassykinss)     See the previous question below. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, not a gastrointestinal virus. The FDA is not aware of the coronavirus being transmitted via food or ingestion. To be safe, you should still wash your hands before cooking or eating.        Will freshman orientation still be in person? (@meganhoanggg)     All new student orientations will be held online, the university announced Monday. UCLA New Student &amp; Transition Programs will also hold interactive online sessions where students can meet with a New Student Advisor, similar to how in-person orientation would be conducted. More information can be found    here   .        They are reporting the disease can come back in the fall, is that true? (@cacvelaz)     As long as there is no vaccine, the virus will continue to infect people. Thats why its important to maintain containment measures until a working vaccine is developed.    Los Angeles has done a good job at holding the pandemic back: Percent increase in the total number of confirmed cases in Los Angeles has not been in the double digits since April 5. But ending stay-at-home orders prematurely and letting people go back to their daily lives may bring people back into close contact with each other, making a resurgence much more likely.    China recently ended its monthslong lockdown of the Hubei province, where the virus was first discovered, after nearly eliminating any new cases of the coronavirus. However, doctors and scientists are worried that China ended the quarantine too early and a resurgence might be coming. Its still too early to tell.        Anxiety is at an all time high; best way to cope with the situation and ease my mind? (@ohassan93)     There are many different ways to cope during these stressful times:     	  If you find yourself with more free time, find ways to occupy yourself with a new hobby. From    live drawing lessons to free workout sessions   , many are teaching classes online to help you stave off boredom.    	  If that doesnt work for you, give yourself space to rest. Productivity doesnt have to manifest tangible results; sometimes, all you need is time to process.    	  Stay in touch with friends and family, either through video messaging,    virtual hangouts   , or just a good old-fashioned phone call. Even when were apart, maintaining healthy social connections is good for our physical and mental health. And more importantly, it reminds us that were not alone in experiencing this unprecedented time together.    	  Pause your news alert notifications and log off your social media accounts. It can feel overwhelming to keep up with the 24/7 news cycle      give yourself a break from reading the news and focus your attention to other parts of your life.    	  You can support your community with or without leaving your house      there are many    small businesses in Westwood    that still offer takeout and delivery, and if youre not in Westwood, consider donating to nonprofit charities that are supporting health care workers, restaurant employees and more. And might we suggest fostering or adopting a pet from an animal shelter?    	  If youre a UCLA student, Counseling and Psychological Services is offering their services online. For more information on what they offer, check its    website   . The UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center is also offering    free guided meditations    through its app or on its website.           Why are we still being charged for campus fees that we cant benefit from due to online class (@ashtincheng)     Students filed class-action lawsuits against the University of California and California State University systems April 27 demanding student fees be refunded. Read more about the lawsuit    here   .    While there are no talks to reduce student fees, the upcoming USAC election includes two referenda on the ballot, both of which would increase student fees. Read more about that    here   .        Hi, among common symptoms stated, what is considered a mild symptom of covid-19? (@withlenee_)     Mild symptoms are those that can be managed at home. Many of these mild symptoms are similar to the flu, including fever, dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, aches, pains and diarrhea. The severity of symptoms vary from person to person  some may show a multitude of symptoms while others may be completely asymptomatic. However, most cases of COVID-19 only show mild symptoms.    Sophia Tolliver, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at The Ohio State University College of Medicine, says fevers are considered moderate if they exceed 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Tolliver advises patients to avoid hospitals and stay home if they have mild or moderate symptoms, including a moderate fever.    However, patients should seek immediate help if they start experiencing shortness of breath. COVID-19 causes the inner lining of the lungs to become thicker, making it harder to push oxygen into the bloodstream and causing shortness of breath. If this becomes worse, patients may need to be intubated and put on a ventilator. The CDC also recommends seeking medical help if you experience new confusion, bluish lips or face, or a persistent pain or pressure in your chest area.        What is the likelihood that summer session C or fall quarter are online? (@juhi_mehta1)     Some departments have moved summer session C classes online  Chancellor Gene Block said April 28 the decision of whether or not to conduct all summer classes remotely will be made soon. Block also said the university plans to offer some fall classes remotely, but the decision might change depending on the situation.    UCLA faculty have been asked to prepare for the event that summer session C will be offered remotely, but no decision has been made yet. The university has not announced whether or not fall 2020 will also be conducted virtually.        Are UCLA students still living in dorms? If so how is that going for them? (@riley.riceee)     Yes, some UCLA students are still on the Hill.   UCLA Housing moved remaining students to single occupancy rooms on April 3 in an effort to promote social distancing.    Students still on campus have been limited to two dining options and all meals are takeout. UCLA Housing also closed a number of bathrooms available on the Hill      in Rieber Hall, only five bathrooms out of 25 remain open.   Some have also reported a sense of loneliness of being the only few remaining on the Hill.   Its lonely, said one student. All my friends are not here anymore. Read the rest    here   .        Is Ucla considering partial tuition refunds for spring quarter? (Karen Sherr, parent of UCLA first-year student)     The university has not announced any partial refunds for tuition for spring quarter. However, if your student canceled their on-campus housing contract, they are entitled to a refund of their spring quarter housing and meal plan expenses. Additionally, UCLA  has suspended  course materials fees  for  certain spring quarter classes   and extended the deadline to pay spring tuition BruinBill charges  to  April 10 at 5 p.m.        Why has UCLA not allowed pass/fail courses to count for major requirements? UC (Irvine) and Berkeley have done so already. Many universities across the country have as well and UCLA has failed its students by not implementing this change. The academic senates policies last week do not help any student when the large majority of departments have indicated they would not be changing their policies, and students become forced to take courses for a letter grade in order to simply graduate on time amidst this pandemic. (Kevin Lee, fourth-year student)     Some departments have allowed students to take major requirement courses as Pass/No Pass, while others have not. No decision has been made for the whole university.    So far, the university has not explained its decision to not extend pass/no pass grading to classes that are major requirements. If you would like to make your voice heard on the situation, we encourage you to    submit an op-ed    (around 600-900 words) to Daily Bruin Opinion.          Update:   As of April 29, all LA County residents can get free coronavirus tests, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. Testing was previously limited to essential workers and those most vulnerable to the disease but was expanded as around half of the test appointments went unused. The county can conduct 18,000 tests a day as of May 1.    UCLA also offers its own nasopharyngeal swab tests and serological antibody tests at    multiple locations    in the UCLA Health system. However, unlike the tests offered by the county, you need an order from your primary care physician to be tested at UCLA.    Older answer:   The City of Los Angeles can conduct about 3,500 tests a day for its 4 million residents. Testing at any testing facility in the city, including at UCLA, is currently limited only to those who have more than seven days left of a mandatory two-week quarantine after a confirmed exposure to the virus; have underlying health conditions; or are over the age of 65. Unless youre in quarantine, you must display symptoms to be eligible for a test.  In other words: No, it's not open to all UCLA students, and it's not feasible to open to all UCLA students at this time. It is unknown whether UCLA tests its students and staff at a higher priority than other city and county residents.        The Food and Drug Administration says the virus is not known to spread by food and food packaging. You should still wash your hands thoroughly after you return from the grocery store and make sure to clean kitchen surfaces.        Yes, alcohol can kill coronavirus in high enough concentrations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using hand sanitizers with concentrations of at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropyl alcohol. Make sure to get the right concentration, because higher concentrations of alcohol can actually evaporate before they can kill the virus. Do not use methanol, as it is toxic to humans.  Drinking alcoholic beverages, however, will not kill the coronavirus.        The novel coronavirus mostly spreads through respiratory droplets, and fabrics can absorb respiratory droplets and carry the virus in those droplets. Some types of fabrics, such as polyester, may carry more germs for a longer period of time than other, more breathable, materials such as cotton. It is recommended to use detergent with bleach in it when washing your clothes.         Serological antibody tests are now available. These tests look for the aftermath of your bodys response to the coronavirus instead of the coronavirus itself. A positive result means your body reacted to the coronavirus and produced antibodies to fight it off, but it takes between one to three weeks after infection for your body to produce these antibodies. Antibodies for SARS-CoV-1, which is responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, remained in the bloodstream for an average of two years,   so a negative antibody test result is a good indicator that you have not recovered from a previous infection of SARS-CoV-2, the current strain of coronavirus. However, you could have a current infection that your body has yet to produce antibodies for.    However, keep in mind that these antibody tests may not be as accurate as swab-based RNA tests, which work by amplifying genetic information through a process called polymerase chain reaction. Experts are also unsure if the antibodies provide immunity to future infections.    As for the PCR swab test results:   A positive novel coronavirus test result means you had a novel coronavirus infection at the time of testing. A negative result means you did not have the virus when you were tested. As of Thursday, the FDA has also approved a test that can determine if you have already recovered from a COVID-19 infection.        There are no exact figures available, but most restaurant and grocery workers do not yet have the personal protective equipment necessary to effectively prevent contracting the virus. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Tuesday that the city is planning an ordinance to provide essential service workers with necessary PPEs, which may help protect them from exposure to the virus.        The Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center is available to all UCLA students, regardless of their UCSHIP status. Call the Ashe Infection Control Line at (310) 206-6217 to speak to a clinician if you are experiencing symptoms of a fever or cough.  There is no known antiviral treatment or cure for COVID-19. Medication can treat individual symptoms such as fevers and cough, but not the underlying virus. Harvard Medical School recommends taking acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol) if you're experiencing pain or fevers, and most experts agree that NSAIDs like ibuprofen (i.e. Advil and Motrin) should be safe to take as well.  It is recommended that you stay hydrated and well-rested as your immune system fights the coronavirus. Immediately call your doctor if symptoms worsen. Do not wait for a medical emergency.  The World Health Organization recommends the following:    	 Isolate yourself in a well-ventilated room. Try not to move around the house. Do laundry with hot water. Regularly disinfect every surface you touch.   	 Wash your hands properly. You can find videos of how to wash hands online.   	 If you have tested positive, you should wear a mask. These do not have to be N95; you should use disposable ""surgical masks."" Immediately dispose of the mask when it gets wet or dirty. Do not reuse masks. Wash your hands immediately afterwards.    We're not doctors, so we cant give you medical advice. We encourage you to talk to your doctor if you are not sure which medications to take.         The CDC has issued a global level-four travel warning and advises against all international travel.   If you must return to the United States, it is recommended you make preparations to do so now.   The CDC has issued a global level-three travel warning and advises against all nonessential international travel.  Even if you absolutely need to return to Los Angeles, additional travel restrictions may apply.  As of Thursday, The current travel restrictions ban the entry of foreign nationals who have visited any of the following countries in the last 14 days to the United States:    	 China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau)   	 Iran   	 Austria   	 Belgium   	 Czech Republic   	 Denmark   	 Estonia   	 Finland   	 France   	 Germany   	 Greece   	 Hungary   	 Iceland   	 Italy   	 Latvia   	 Liechtenstein   	 Lithuania   	 Luxembourg   	 Malta   	 Netherlands   	 Norway   	 Poland   	 Portugal   	 Slovakia   	 Slovenia   	 Spain   	 Sweden   	 Switzerland   	 The United Kingdom    If you have to go back to Hong Kong, you will be required to quarantine yourself for two weeks either at home or at a hotel. We do not know how the situation will develop in the coming months. Its entirely possible that Hong Kong may ban incoming flights from the United States while you're in Los Angeles. If this happens, you may have to ask your respective embassy for help.  U.S. citizens and permanent residents should not have issues entering the U.S. The Department of State is also coordinating repatriation efforts for American citizens stranded overseas. However, under Department of Homeland Security guidelines, American citizens, permanent residents and immediate family members must arrive at one of 13 designated airports and self-quarantine at home for 14 days.  Regardless of your nationality or destination, the CDC recommends that you should isolate yourself for two weeks after traveling internationally.  Again, although it is possible to return to LA during this pandemic, you should be avoiding all unnecessary travel, both for your sake and the sake of others. UCLA has extended remote instruction through summer session A, which ends Aug. 28. Whether summer session C will also be online is unknown.        Yes, UCLA employees working during the pandemic are paid.  The University of California announced Thursday that it will not lay off career employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A career employee is someone who works at least half the time a full-time employee would and is typically employed for at least a year.  Each full-time employee whose job has been interrupted by COVID-19 can also take up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave.  Although most students have moved out of the residential halls, some students continue to live on the Hill. UCLA Housing has begun moving remaining students to single occupancy rooms April 3 in an effort to promote social distancing. Housing authorities at other UC campuses have been moving students to singles since at least March 23, according to a UC Office of the President spokesperson.        Talk to your landlord and discuss your options first. Garcetti announced a partial rent freeze for the City of LA. Under this order, your landlords cannot raise rent if you live in a rent-stabilized unit. You can check if you live in one here:  https://hcidla.lacity.org/RSO-Property-Search . Additionally, California implemented a statewide moratorium on evictions through May 31, 2020.       Where on campus/what buildings were the confirmed cases at UCLA mostly in? (Joe Bruin)    UCLA has not made this information public so far       Impact on Westwood businesses (specifically Broxton, Enzo's, the movie theaters, and any other beloved Westwood locations), also whether or not the UCLA Store will offer free shipping of textbooks and school supplies to its students because so far I haven't seen anything (Kaitlyn Peterson, 4th-year English &amp; Communications student)    Rocco's Tavern has laid off 95% of its staff and is applying for emergency small business loans and aid from the government. The state put in place a  moratorium on evictions , however, so they might not have to pay rent (which has been increasing for many buildings in the Village). But no one knows what it will be like for local businesses once the pandemic is over.  If you want to continue supporting Westwood businesses, Daily Bruin created a map of their updated hours and if they offer delivery or takeout.  In regards to the UCLA store, shipping for textbooks is free through Sunday for orders of $50 or more.     You may have immunity for a while, but just like the flu, new strains of the coronavirus to which you may not have immunity will form over time. Luckily, SARS-CoV-2 mutates at a fraction of the rate of the flu virus, which means immunity (either natural or vaccine-induced) will likely last for a while.     &nbsp;   Loading ",['cap-jhan'],"['campus', 'international', 'news', 'science-health', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/frame_3-1024x673.png

UCLA Healths coronavirus testing capacity has more than tripled in a week. The university could only administer 150 tests per day March 19, UCLA Health spokesperson Jane Murcia said.    The expansion comes as the United States faces a shortage of coronavirus tests nationwide and Los Angeles reserves tests for patients with severe symptoms. The LA Department of Public Health recommended March 19 that doctors only test people if a positive result would affect the course of treatment.    The tests are conducted across multiple clinic locations in the UCLA Health system, said Johnese Spisso, president of UCLA Health, and Robert Cherry, chief medical and quality officer, in an internal email.    The increase in testing capacity has come at the cost of turnaround time. Test results will be available in two to four days, according to the email. Previous tests at UCLA could give results in two to three hours  ,   Murcia said in an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News.    The university will screen patients according to the LADPHs guidelines for testing eligibility. Patients must first see a primary care physician before seeking a test. Common symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.    Los Angeles faces an increasing number of COVID-19 cases. LA Mayor Eric Garcetti estimated Wednesday that in six days the situation in LA will reach that of New York City, which reported 100 new deaths Thursday.    In comparison, LA County saw nine new deaths Thursday, a threefold increase from the day before, LADHP director Barbara Ferrer said.    LA City residents who are 65 and older, have underlying conditions or are in quarantine after exposure to the virus can make appointments    online    for testing if they have symptoms of COVID-19. The city has a limited number of appointments and may be fully booked. ",['cap-jhan'],"['california', 'campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.news_.ebolaspeaks.OE_.jpg

After his second playing season in Westwood, Jalen Hill has declared for the 2020 NBA Draft.  The redshirt sophomore forward/centers name was on the publicly released list of underclassmen who declared for the draft. In his second full season, Hill made 25 starts for the Bruins and averaged 9.0 points, 6.9 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game  each good for at least second-best on the team.  Hill is the second UCLA player to declare for the draft, as junior guard Chris Smith announced his decision to declare three weeks ago. Both players are early entry candidates, meaning they have until June 3 to decide if they want to pursue professional careers or return to Westwood.  This deadline is subject to change if the NBA decides to adjust the draft, which is currently scheduled for June 25.  In his redshirt freshman season, the Corona, California, native made only 15 starts in the Bruins 33 games, averaging 20.2 minutes per game. Under Cronin, Hill played over 24 minutes per game and doubled his points average from 4.3 to 9.0. The redshirt sophomore also improved on his 0.4 blocks and 0.4 steals, raising those numbers to 1.1 and 0.6, respectively.

Since the onset of the outbreak, the current news cycle has been consumed by coronavirus coverage, and each breaking update seems to bring worse updates than the day before. Its easy to get overwhelmed by the noise.  However, even with all the epidemiological curves, increasing case numbers and  toilet paper shortages , there is some good news. We here at The Quad want to share some of the good stuff that has sprouted amid the chaos.  For starters, there appear to be some promising updates from the virus' place of origin. The oldest survivor of COVID-19,  a 103-year-old woman , recovered after only six days of treatment in a Wuhan, China, hospital. And just days before,  a 100-year-old Chinese man  also recovered from the virus, despite his underlying health conditions.  In addition to these recoveries, the light at the end of the tunnel appears to be nearing closer for the city of Wuhan. Not only have all 16 of the  temporary hospitals  recently closed, but the city's travel restrictions will be  lifted  April 8, ending a nearly three-month-long lockdown period. These measures may serve as vital signs of the virus containment.  In other areas where the spread of the virus is still in its earlier stages, many companies are doing what they can to lessen shortages as they crop up. For example, distilleries are aiding with their most valuable resource: high-proof alcohol.  Several distilleries  have helped address the shortage of alcohol-based sanitizers, a highly demanded product during the pandemic. Atlantas  Old Fourth Distillery  even distributed its coveted product free of charge.  The outbreak has also caused a shortage of ventilators, but technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has come to the rescue. He pledged to repurpose Tesla Gigafactory 2 for the manufacture of ventilators and has already donated 1,255 ventilators to New York hospitals.  While coronavirus has caused a range of consequences, from unfortunate shortages to tragic losses of life, it has also led to some unforeseen environmental developments.   The Washington Post  recently analyzed data from the European Space Agency, discovering significant declines in Italys nitrogen dioxide levels. Emanuele Massetti, an economics of climate change expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology, even made a startling claim about the research in the article: Northern Italy will soon enjoy the cleanest air it has ever experienced.  Moreover, there are other silver linings for wildlife. No, there aren't  dolphins swimming  in the Venice canals, but some animals have been able to enjoy time outside their usual homes. In Chicagos Shedd Aquarium, penguins got a taste of freedom, getting to leave their glass enclosures to roam the surrounding aquarium.    The adventure continues!  This morning, Edward and Annie explored Shedds rotunda. They are a bonded pair of rockhopper penguins, which means they are together for nesting season. Springtime is nesting season for penguins at Shedd, and this year is no different! (1/3)   pic.twitter.com/VdxN3oQAfe  &mdash; Shedd Aquarium (@shedd_aquarium)  March 16, 2020       On top of the liberated penguins, theres also been some good news for our furry friends. Recent  research  suggests that our pets do not show symptoms for or spread the virus. Thankfully, we dont have to stay 6 feet away from them.  But the good news doesnt end there  in Italy, citizens are managing to keep their spirits up.  Viral videos  from various cities show Italians singing and dancing from their balconies and windows. In one video, the residents danced to the Macarena, and in others, people sang patriotic songs while banging on saucepans.  Such videos, specifically from the country that has suffered the  highest death count  because of the virus, have garnered thousands of views and seem to serve as an emblem of human resilience.  This resilience, however, is not unique to Italy  small acts of kindness and inspiration have been discovered everywhere.  In Bend, Oregon, a particularly uplifting story was shared by professional runner Rebecca Mehra. Mehra wrote in a  Twitter thread  that a couple in their 80s grabbed her attention in a grocery store parking lot, asking to help them with their shopping as they were too scared to go in themselves. Mehra got their groceries and loaded them in their trunk.  Mehras act is small, yet powerful. And whats most heartening is that she said she believes most people would have done the same thing.  As  Politico magazine  writes, the virus is a common enemy that doesnt discriminate or make any distinctions. When our individual differences are overlooked, we may rediscover unifying energy  possibly one that could inspire more acts like Mehras.  While Mehra's story and other positive news coverage don't make the outbreak any less serious, they do serve as encouraging reminders that can strengthen our hope.  Five-year-old Taytum Bauman, who films pretend YouTube videos that are occasionally shared on Facebook by her mom, made an endearing  coronavirus advice video . In the viral footage, Bauman says it best: ""I know you're very scared, but it's OK.""

(With) such serious misconduct and no evidence of rehabilitation, allowing respondent to continue practicing would not be protective   of   the public or of public confidence in the medical profession, administrative law judge Thomas Heller wrote in a report to the Medical Board of California.    Guillermo Andres Cortes, who was    suspended    from his post as a UCLA cardiologist in May 2018, is accused of assaulting three women, including Los Angeles doctor Meena Zareh.    Heller made the recommendation to the Medical Board of California, which will ultimately decide on whether or not to revoke his license. Heller found convincing evidence presented in Zarehs case, but not in the case of two other accusers, as first reported by    the Los Angeles Times   .    Cortes claims the incident with Zareh did not happen and sexual encounters with the other two accusers were consensual, according to Hellers report.    Zarehs case was investigated by the county, which placed Cortes on leave. However, the county found the evidence presented to be inconclusive   and Cortes was allowed to return to work. No criminal charges were filed against Cortes for the accusations made by any of the three accusers.    Cortes is not currently working as a physician, according to the LA Times report. However, his medical license is current, and is set to expire April 30.    Zareh filed a civil suit against Cortes, the LA County health department and USCs medical school in December 2016 for sexual battery, sexual harassment and employee discrimination, among other allegations.    Cortes also faces a second sexual assault lawsuit filed in 2019 by Annahita Sarcon, a former fellow in the Keck School of Medicine. Hellers report, which identifies an accuser with the initials A.S. who sued Cortes for sexual assault, could not conclude Cortes encounter with A.S. was nonconsensual.    The third accuser, identified only as C.G. in Hellers report, filed a police report three years after her alleged incident but has not filed any lawsuits. Heller also found her claims inconclusive.    Cortes was hired at UCLA in 2017 but was suspended a year later. At the time of his suspension, UCLA Healths spokesperson Phil Hampton said the university was not aware of the charges against Cortes.   The jury trial for Zarehs suit is scheduled for Sept. 15 in Department 37 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.","['cap-marilyn-chavez-martinez', 'cap-jhan']","['los-angeles', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/IMG_3377.jpg

The coachs newest addition is his highest-ranked yet.    Four-star athlete Devin Kirkwood committed to UCLA football Thursday afternoon. Kirkwood   whose mother attended UCLA  is the third player in the class of 2021 to commit to the Bruins but is the only four-star of the bunch so far.    The Gardena, California, native narrowed his potential destinations to UCLA, Colorado, Notre Dame, California and Arizona State on May 5.    Immediately after Kirkwood committed, the Bruins took over the No. 6 spot in the 2021 Pac-12 recruiting rankings and are now ranked 71st nationally by 247Sports. UCLAs average recruit rating of 88.40 ranks fourth in the Pac-12, behind only Oregon, USC and Utah.    Kirkwood is the No. 22 prospect in California and No. 231 prospect in the country according to 247Sports composite rankings, making him the fourth-highest nationally ranked commit since   Kelly joined the program, behind only rising sophomore offensive lineman Sean Rhyan, rising junior wide receiver Chase Cota and incoming freshman linebacker Damian Sellers.

The new prequel to ""The Hunger Games series takes place more than 60 years before the events of the original book but still lands on a familiar face. Eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow may ring a bell for many readers, as the characteristically ambitious boy is none other than future antagonist President Snow.  Now placing him in the role of protagonist, author Suzanne Collins finds herself walking a careful line: how to captivate readers with a character so vile, self-absorbed and unchanging. And she almost succeeds, too.  The plot follows Coriolanus as he is recruited to help the Capitol of Panem gain viewership for its 10th annual Hunger Games, which lacks many of the bells and whistles found in the 74th and 75th. As one of the first mentors, he is assigned to market District 12 tribute Lucy Gray Baird, garnering sympathy and increasing viewer investment in the games.  But following a protagonist solely bent on bettering his own place in society comes with the risk of leaving readers dissatisfied. From the book's early pages, Collins allows for a view into the character's world, and its one that revolves solely around himself. What starts out as an interesting thought project becomes laborious as Coriolanus presents different false versions of himself to everyone he interacts with just one goal in mind  control over his situation. His heightened level of grandeur in front of the cameras, for example, accentuates his need to be viewed as a member of the upper class.   [Related:    Recent Rewinds: 'The Hunger Games' returns, giving readers revealing look at President Snow   ]   As a result, the books antagonists are often those most unlike not-yet-President Snow. Among such prestigious ranks are a kind Districts-turned-Capitol boy named Sejanus Plinth and his school dean. But   Collins cleverly depicts Coriolanus as unable to grasp their motivations, as he attempts to justify what the characters stand to gain from their actions, fully misunderstanding concepts of selflessness and guilt.  Lucy Gray and Sejanus provide the likability, taking on   similar tropes found in the earlier books. The girl, an idealistic version of what Katniss Everdeen could be if she enjoyed putting on performances, gifts the story with a sense of class that surely inspires the pompous games decades later. And Sejanus takes on a Peeta Mellark-esque role, showing moments of humanity as he attempts to better the living conditions of the tributes by offering them food or criticizing their living conditions leading up to the games.  While some characters show dynamic growth in the face of difficulties, Coriolanus never quite makes a change  though the plot seems to imply he did. He is introduced in a state of poverty and emotionally scarred from the rebellion, but his initial character is already far more villainous than those of his classmates. Hes the only brainwashed student to have memorized the Capitols official anthem, after all.  But as his actions become more cruel, no descent into madness is explored, no character arc given. Hes just predictably boring.  In place of growth, Collins accents the character with wishy-washy moments of morality early on, as if she herself hasnt quite figured out how to make Coriolanus interesting. He often does noble things, like swear to help Lucy Gray win the games. And while this is originally done in good faith, the motivation soon becomes a cash prize. While the selfish reasoning makes sense given his personality, the initially selfless justification does not fit into his character, making such moments feel somewhat weak.   [Related:    UCLA student authors book covering themes of mental health and identity   ]   Thankfully, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes finds a better grip in expanding upon the world established by the original trilogy. The abysmal shape of the initial Hunger Games, for one, offers a new take on the condition of Panem fresh off the heels of war. Coriolanus and his counterparts shape the beginnings of the pay-to-play reality show through interviews and participatory programs like sending food to the tributes.  Other satisfying callbacks include the origins of songs from the prior books and further elaboration on the symbolism behind   the mockingjay  a bird that lends its name to the final book in the original trilogy.  And while much of President Snows mysterious intrigue is lost through the books revelations of his selfish character, the plot provides enough action to make the read worth it. Even in a less dramatized state, the Hunger Games explore many of humanity's darker sides. Of course, most readers will know the protagonist is fated to eventually succeed into power, but beyond that, the storyline generates interest through its mostly unpredictable twists and turns.  With a character so unflinchingly stagnant though, Collins finds redemption in her decision not to glamorize or justify his villainy. The result: a sometimes-boring book about an always-captivating dystopia.",['cap-eli-countryman'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.hungergamesreview.courtesy.jpg

At UCLA, our community is remarkably united by similar feelings of loss, confusion and concern, but also by light, hope and perspective that the pandemic has brought to the forefront. In Columns From Quarantine, Daily Bruin staffers and community submissions highlight the personal stories that mark this unprecedented moment. If you have a quarantine story to tell, you can submit it    here    or email    columnsfromquarantine@gmail.com .   [caption id=""attachment_380033"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Andrea Grigsby/Illustrations Director)[/caption]  Quarantine is a rollercoaster, to say the least.  Some days you are baking banana bread, watching TikToks and spending unprecedented amounts of time with your dog, and it all feels manageable.  Other days, not so much.  Searching what universities are considering for the fall last week, I discovered that many are planning for virtual semesters  and quickly panicked that UCLA might do the same.  My mom tried to reconcile my anxious feelings. Her words, although well-intentioned, upset me.  You had two and a half great years and if you dont get the end you wanted, maybe that can be enough, she said.  With threatening tears, I sharply turned to her: I worked so hard for a four-year college experience. Not three. Or two and three quarters.  Im a current junior, and while that has its unmistakable merits compared to current seniors, I still worry about how my final year will unfold.  Regardless of current class standing or when you came to UCLA, were all on the same page  we worked hard to get here. And when we got here, we came with a narrative that we were ready to shape and a known amount of time to do so.  Although nothing but the virus is to blame, its still a hard pill to swallow. The reality is that even a quarter short of the full college experience feels like a raw deal.  I dont mean to cross purposes; an education, even one online, is nothing short of a privilege. But pain  despite its source, degree or relativity  is still pain. And when the news about spring quarter first broke, we all couldnt help but feel it.  I grieved the loss and looked forward  I still have another year, three more quarters. But my dangerous Google searching bared not only my own vulnerability, but the vulnerability of our collective futures.  No decision for fall has been made, but conversations are buzzing. Even if we have an in-person quarter, its landscape may look completely different, from Rose Bowl bleachers left empty to 300-seat lecture halls filled with 30 masked students. Many of the classic and adored aspects of college life will likely be changed, and their rediscovery depends on a vaccine that has no delivery date.  And given this reality, combined with being a rising senior, my college experience, as I knew it, has never felt so fleeting.  Its quite eerie that the sentiments of a soon-to-be graduate are felt by a rising senior.  I dont know the next time Ill get to walk Bruin Walk, rejecting flyers that give that strip both nuisance and personality. Or the next time Ill enter a full lecture hall and awkwardly stumble through a row of students to reach the one and only empty seat.  Instead, I struggle to leave all the cage doors open. Maybe life as I knew it will return and Ill get the senior year I want. Or maybe it wont.  I try to live in the face of the unknown, but consistently accepting the overarching gloom over my leading year is no easy feat. So, contrary to every cheesy quote, I look to the past.  I look back on what is clear: my freshman year, sophomore year and two-thirds of my junior year. As I sift through my brains recollections and my Snapchat memories, my moms words linger and I wrestle with their meaning.  Maybe two and half great years can be enough.  The words float like a mysterious algebra problem. I repeat them until I recognize all that hides behind them. I think about the little things.  All the times I treaded up the death stairs, making it back to my freshman dorm room, both laughing and panting at the same time. Or the nights I raced to In-N-Out on the cusp of closing, relishing in my success with every bite.  But I also think about the bigger things.  My attempt at journalism, which despite being completely outside my field of interest, presented me with a new passion and voice. My semester abroad, when I frolicked around Europe, saw my self-doubt dissolve and my independence solidify. My bad days and challenges, which although bringing more tears than Id like to admit, thickened my skin and changed my aim.  I think about the professors, intimidating and all, who pulled me out of my educational comfort zone and challenged me to work harder. The middle schoolers I mentored, who were never short of questions, sparked my own curiosity. The friends I made, who although hard to get all in the same room, helped me laugh harder and be better.  [caption id=""attachment_380034"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Courtesy of Rachel Sarrafzadeh)[/caption]  I think about UCLA, its chaos and beauty alike, and how it inspired new depths of achievement  from small to big, silly to serious, passive to active, personal to academic.  It was these memories  the ones that would endure  that made me realize that the worth of my college experience does not depend on the course of an unforeseeable virus. Although I wanted to shape a full narrative in a four-year timeline, the one I already had in two and a half years was, as my mom said, great.  I still hold out hope that my college experience will end with the UCLA that I know and love  that Ill get to bid a proper farewell without a global pandemic looming over my shoulders.  The hard truth is that I dont know how the future will unfold. The comfort is that no one else does either.  In the meantime, though, theres a lot to be grateful for. I have a kitchen to bake my banana bread, a mom who cares enough to listen to my millennial worries and two and a half years worth of memories that maybe, just maybe, are enough.

99,/2020/05/27/scouting-report-johnny-juzang/,1224.0,1114.0,215,1038.0,0.9355,0.8798999999999999,$0.00,Scouting Report: Johnny Juzang,https://dailybruin.com/2020/05/27/scouting-report-johnny-juzang/,"Thu, 28 May 2020 06:14:50 +0000",Camayak_6cbf65a89c," Johnny Juzang should have been a senior at Harvard-Westlake School last season, just 8 miles away from Pauley Pavilion.   Instead, he traveled across the country to suit up in blue and white in Rupp Arena and get a taste of the college game a little early.  The rising sophomore guard/forward transferred to UCLA men's basketball April 9 after averaging 2.9 points and 1.9 rebounds per game in 28 appearances at Kentucky last season. He shot 37.7% from the field and scored in double-digits twice as a freshman.  Juzang's numbers may not have ranked near the top of the SEC leaderboards &#8211; or his team's, for that matter &#8211; but his freshman stats don't diminish his experience as a scoring threat in high school.  The once four-star recruit averaged 19.9 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in his high school career while shooting 44% from the field, 35% from deep and 80% from the line. Despite his limited minutes at Kentucky, 247Sports ranked him as the No. 2 transfer in the country April 9.  Juzang had his immediate eligibility transfer waiver approved Wednesday, meaning he'll officially have the chance to don blue and gold for the Bruins next season.   With guard Chris Smith still sitting in the 2020 NBA Draft pool, coach Mick Cronin's wing rotation could get a makeover ahead of the 2020-2021 season. Juzang figures to be a key piece of Cronin's lineup &#8211; with or without Smith on the roster next year &#8211; because of his shooting ability, rebounding IQ and versatility on both sides of the ball.   Consistent shooting     Juzang has had one defining tool since his high school days &#8211; his 3-point shot.   The wing's high release is fundamentally sound, and he is often unfazed by closing out defenders. Juzang's form did not change in any noticeable way when he got to college, and his contested shots are nearly identical to his uncontested attempts.         Juzang thrives in catch-and-shoot situations, both from the corner and the top of the key. He has limited highlights at Kentucky of shooting off-the-dribble and spot-up jumpers from deep, but he has a good pull-up midrange game with a smooth one-dribble gather.  Shooting 32.6% from deep is not typically the mark of a great shooter, but Juzang did just that during his freshman year at Kentucky. He had limited minutes and a rigidly defined role last season, as he was the only Wildcat to attempt more 3s than 2s &#8211; which likely hindered his production early on.  The stats don't show his consistent and smooth release, however, and 43 3-point attempts is too small of a sample size to judge him on. Juzang took 441 triples in high school and hit 154 of them &#8211; nothing groundbreaking by any means, but a solid mark for a teenage volume shooter.        One of the best statistical baselines to measure jump-shooting ability is free throw percentage, and Juzang shot an 83.3% clip from the charity stripe at Kentucky. His 12 attempts on the season is a small sample size as well &#8211; indicating a heavy reliance on his jumper &#8211; but he did post an identical 83.3% mark across his final two years at Harvard-Westlake.  Juzang is not as reliant on his 3-point shot as the Bruins' other sharpshooters on the roster &#8211; rising sophomore guard/forward Jake Kyman and rising junior guard David Singleton &#8211; but the trio will giving Cronin flexibility and the ability to space the floor with multiple different lineups.  Kyman and Singleton combined to take 74.8% of their field goal attempts from 3-point range, while Juzang took 55.8% of his shots from deep. Kyman proved to be a reliable corner specialist this season, while more of Singleton's attempts came from up top.  Juzang brings the best of both to the table, and while he isn't as prolific a shooter as his two new teammates, he gives Cronin another 3-point weapon that can move all over the floor.   Rebounding IQ   Juzang's 6-foot-6 frame doesn't set him apart from the crowd below the basket, but he has the vision and agility to establish himself as a plus-rebounder at his position.  Listed at 214 pounds, Juzang has both the height and weight advantage over most collegiate shooting guards, and he has the speed and instincts to gather long rebounds better than most as well. His reliance on using his downhill speed and vision to read the boards allows him to rack up second-chance points at a high rate.         Juzang averaged 1.9 rebounds per game last season, roughly a quarter of which came on the offensive boards. His 6.3 rebounds per 40 minutes and 9.2 rebounds per 100 possessions in 2019-2020 would rank fifth among returning Bruins, should Smith stay in the NBA Draft.  After averaging 9.1 rebounds per game in his sophomore and junior seasons of high school, Juzang continued to prove he could read the ball well in Lexington, Kentucky, both in fast-break and half-court scenarios. Whether it was an air ball, hit front rim or an accidental off-the-backboard pass, Juzang was there to clean it up on multiple occasions last season.        Cronin's board-crashing tendencies could help Juzang further maximize his potential as a rebounder.  UCLA ranked second in the Pac-12 in offensive rebounds and first in defensive rebounds against during conference play. Smith, rising junior guard Jules Bernard and rising sophomore guard/forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. &#8211; who has a nearly identical 6-foot-6, 215-pound build to Juzang &#8211; combined to post 30 games with six or more rebounds last season.  Juzang won't be the strongest rebounder on the team &#8211; or even the best rebounding wing &#8211; but his ability to use his speed and size to crash the boards makes him a perfect fit for Cronin's system.   Defensive potential   Juzang has yet to establish himself as a lockdown defender, but his long arms and switching ability give him the potential to approach that role later in his career.  At 6-foot-6, Juzang already has good size for the shooting guard position. He can physically outmatch most ball-handlers and shooters, and his plus-wingspan will make it difficult for opposing players to shoot over.  Juzang isn't just a big body, however, as he still has the speed of a guard to help him round out his defensive game.         The Los Angeles native has good footwork for an 18-year-old, and he is athletic enough to stay in front of driving ball-handlers, something Cronin's team struggled with in the first half of the season. Most of his athleticism is lateral as opposed to vertical, meaning he doesn't project to be a high-flying shot-blocker anytime soon.  Juzang's 0.2 steals and 0.1 blocks per game &#8211; which translate to 0.6 and 0.2 per 40 minutes, respectively &#8211; suggest his production is not close to approaching his potential on the defensive end just yet. With a defensive mind like Cronin in his ear, that could change sooner rather than later.   Player comparisons: Jordan Adams, Trevor Ariza   Juzang has a long and mature build not often seen in teenage wings, and he has the shooting and potential to go along with it.  Juzang is one inch taller than Jordan Adams was when he played at UCLA from 2012-2014. Both play at similar weights, but their similarities as scorers stand out as well. Adams also shot sub-33% from deep his freshman year, but he shot 35.6% during his sophomore year and 38.7% in his NBA and G League career.  Adams, too, had plus-size for a college shooting guard, and his score-first mentality led to him leading the Bruins in scoring with 17.4 points per game as a sophomore. Juzang likely won't play as important of a role to the offense in his first year at UCLA, but he has the potential to be a high-teens scorer and grab five-plus rebounds per game much like Adams did in Westwood.  If Juzang has an NBA ceiling like 247Sports national recruiting expert Josh Gershon wrote in 2018, his game could grow to resemble another former Bruin, Trevor Ariza.  The two both have a consistent, smooth jumper with a high release and thrive on catch-and-shoots, while also maintaining the versatility to get the job done on the other end of the floor. Ariza is two inches taller than Juzang, but the latter's wingspan and muscle help him make up the difference.        Ariza shot just 23.7% from long range in his lone season at UCLA and 31.7% across the first eight seasons of his NBA career, but he has become a true 3-and-D threat in recent seasons, shooting 36.2% from 3 over his last eight seasons.  Juzang has been a hot commodity for years, and he may start to come into his own in 2020-2021. Cronin is capable of fine-tuning Juzang's defensive techniques and giving him the chance to regularly shoot jumpers within the flow of the offense.   Even if Smith rejoins the team in the fall, Juzang could become one of the best sixth men in the Pac-12 next season.

The list of basketball legends who have suited up in Pauley Pavilion is longer than nearly any other school's, and the debates over the best of the best remain relevant to this day.   After constructing a budget matrix to rank players at each position, the Daily Bruin Sports editors sat down to draw up their own championship-winning lineups with only $15 to spend.    Join the discussion by following us on Twitter at  @DBSports  and  sharing your own lineups  with the world.    Ball-Miller-Kapono-Mbah a Moute-Love   Sam Connon, Sports editor   In today's game, it's more important than ever that your team can shoot the long ball.  Just look at the Golden State Warriors, who revolutionized NBA basketball with point guard Stephen Curry and shooting guard Klay Thompson's Splash Brothers pairing. Or Mike D'Antoni's new-era offense kickstarted by two-time MVP Steve Nash and brought into the modern era by James Harden and Chris Paul.  UCLA men's basketball has boasted plenty of knockdown shooters in its history, and I want to build a team of the best of them.  Shooting guard Reggie Miller was the NBA's all-time 3-point leader at the time of his retirement, and the record lasted nearly a decade after he left the game. Miller broke that record despite the fact he played in an era that wasn't too keen on volume 3-point shooting, and his 43.9% 3-point percentage during his senior year at UCLA isn't half bad either.  The best shooting big man to call Pauley Pavilion home is another five-dollar player, Kevin Love. While he only shot 35.4% on 2.1 3-point attempts per game in his lone season as a Bruin, he has since gone on to drain 1,223 triples at a 37% clip in the NBA, fueling the stretch big movement in the pros.  The most efficient shooter to come out of UCLA is Jason Kapono, who shot 44.6% from deep on 710 collegiate attempts and 43.4% on 1,054 attempts in the NBA. Lonzo Ball may not have been able to lead his team past the Sweet 16, but his 41.2% 3-point percentage at UCLA was enough to convince the Los Angeles Lakers to take him No. 2 overall in the 2017 NBA Draft.  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute was far from a good 3-point shooter in college  shooting 21.5% on less than one attempt per game across his three-year career  but he did shoot 34.5% from deep in his last five NBA campaigns.  Add in the fact that Mbah a Moute and Ball are top-notch defenders and that Ball and Love are great facilitators for their positions, and you have a well-rounded team that's ready to win a championship the second it steps on the court.   Ball-Miller-VanDeWeghe-Mbah a Moute-Abdul-Jabbar   Jack Perez, assistant Sports editor   If Im building a team for the college game, theres one man who is an automatic pick every single time  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Then-named Lew Alcindor, Abdul-Jabbar averaged 26.4 points and 15.5 rebounds per game during his three seasons wearing the blue and gold. In three championship campaigns, he dominated most teams almost single-handedly and should be included in every UCLA all-time roster.  Since I have the best collegiate player of all time, the next logical thing to do would build the team around him. To complement the big man, I need shooters, height and players who can guard multiple positions.  At point guard, Im riding with Lonzo Ball for $2. Although he played just one season in Westwood, he carried his team to the Sweet Sixteen behind solid shooting numbers and plus defense. However, its his innate passing ability and court vision that set him up to be a perfect partner to Abdul-Jabbar.  At my forward spots, Ill use one dollar each on Kiki VanDeWeghe and Luc Richard Mbah a Moute. The two foreign-born Bruins both stand at around 6-foot-8 and while VanDeWeghe would bring the shooting, Mbah a Moute would provide a tough defensive mentality, taking on the best forward the opposition could throw at the Bruins.  This all leads to the one UCLA player who will be my go-to guy on the outside, as Im choosing Reggie Miller with my remaining cash.  Miller can do it all. He can pass, shoot inside or outside and get a few steals per game. Coming in at 6-foot-7, he would be a matchup nightmare against opposing shooting guards.  With this combination of players, opposing teams will struggle to score and keep up, giving time for my reserve point guard Jordan Farmar to get some minutes.   Love-Westbrook-Kapono-Ball-LaVine   Coral Smith, assistant Sports editor   I firmly believe that the youth are the future of sports, so my entire lineup will be made up of players that competed as Bruins during my lifetime.  While my colleagues built a team based on some legendary players, I wanted to go with a bit of a wild-card strategy, and focus on players who might not have the sta status but do have the skill to make a well-rounded, high-scoring team.  The foundation for my lineup would be the combination of Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love, both $5 players who actually competed together at UCLA in 2007-2008.  I remember being a kid and watching Love and Westbrook play together in that one year before both headed to the NBA. That team was the last Bruin team to get to the Final Four, and I'd be lying if I said that little bit of nostalgia didn't play into my decision to recruit them both.  Since leaving UCLA, both players have proven themselves as quality players at the professional level. Westbrook is an overall offensive threat, as he ranks second all-time in the NBA in triple-doubles and has proven he's able to shoot from anywhere on the court. Love, for his part, has gone to the NBA Finals four times and won the championship in 2016.  With just $5 for the rest of my team, Jason Kapono, while not the most well-known name, seemed a good, affordable choice to add more scoring potential to complement Westbrook.  Kapono sits third on the list of all-time leading scorers, tied with 2,095 points with Reggie Miller, and just behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, both of whom are obviously legendary shooters, but out of my budget.  Getting Kapono's shooting for the low price of $2, instead of the $6 I'd spend on Abdul-Jabbar, would be a steal for my lineup.  Lonzo Ball and Zach LaVine round out my lineup as two consistent 3-point shooters that are undervalued in this ranking. Despite only spending one year with the Bruins each, Ball had a 41.2% clip from the arc, and LaVine 37.5%, and both also proved themselves as solid defensive options.  These players are still young and four are still playing in the NBA, so their legacies haven't been cemented quite as much as those we immediately think of in relation to UCLA men's basketball. But that doesn't necessarily mean that they wouldn't be able to hold their own, and that's what I'm betting on.   Davis-Miller-VanDeWeghe-Greenwood-Abdul-Jabbar   Jared Tay, assistant Sports editor   I spent $86 out of my $200 auction budget on New Orleans Saint's running back Alvin Kamara in my fantasy football league last season.  I then proceeded to spend another $53 on the Kansas City Chief's star wide-out Tyreek Hill.  Between Kamara's decreased production and Hill's injuries, to say that my strategy of blowing money on big stars failed spectacularly would be, well, a massive understatement.  So naturally, I decided to adopt the exact same strategy here.  The two big-ticket players that I'm banking on to carry the squad are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Reggie Miller. There's not much of an explanation needed for these two. Abdul-Jabbar would bring dominance in the paint both on offense and defense, while Miller would bring almost an unparalleled ability to score from outside.  Committing a defense to guard either Abdul-Jabbar down low, or Miller up top would be a nightmare. These two dominated at both the collegiate and professional levels of the game, and I don't think I have to worry about either of them having an ""off-season."" It would be money well-invested.  To round out the squad, I like Kiki VanDeWeghe's ability to score from outside with his step-back, Baron Davis should have good vision to distribute the ball to more reliable scorers across the floor, and David Greenwood's consistent shooting from inside should fit nicely.  My strategy of spending big in the early going didn't work for football. In fact, I became $20 poorer for my efforts.  But I have a good feeling about this lineup. Perhaps the second time is the charm.   Davis-LaVine-VanDeWeghe-Walton-Abdul-Jabbar   Jacqueline Dzwonczyk, assistant Sports editor   Im just going to put this out there now  I know next to nothing about historical UCLA basketball.  What I do know about mens basketball in general is that the best teams only need a couple great players and then a few more place holders. That is why I decided to make the most of my budget by splurging on both $6 options, subsequently settling for three $1 players to round out my roster.  Youre probably thinking its a bad idea to pick two centers  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton  but hear me out. Having players as dominant as they were in the paint is an underrated part of modern college basketball, plus a little interteam rivalry makes for great press.  With my remaining $3 and three open spots, I selected Baron Davis, Zach LaVine and Kiki VanDeWeghe. Again, these selections are based entirely on what positions and money were leftover after my strategic first and second picks. All they need to be able to do is play into my system by feeding both centers at every opportunity they get.  If this were almost any other sport, Id probably go for a bunch of middle-of-the-road guys, banking on chemistry and teamwork and all that.  But thats not how basketball works. No amount of lesser players is worth one Abdul-Jabbar or Walton.  And if that means committing to a poorly spaced formation and a comparatively poor backcourt, so be it.      Editor's note: Former All-American Arron Afflalo was left off of the board not because we believe LaVine is better, but because we just completely forgot. The same cannot be said for Tyus Edney, Jordan Farmar and Earl Watson, who were in the running but ultimately got beat out by the five point guards who did make the list.

The GRE, GMAT, LSAT and MCAT have all been altered or canceled over public safety concerns. Three smaller tests  the Dental Admission Test, Optometry Admission Test and Pharmacy College Admission Test  have also been canceled.  The GRE and GMAT, which were both already computer-based tests typically taken in computer testing centers, are now offering remote take-home versions of their tests, said Jeff Thomas, Kaplan Test Preps executive director of admissions programs.  The LSAT is normally a tablet-based test taken at a designated testing center, Thomas added. Currently, the LSAT-Flex, a modified remote version of the LSAT is available to students who had their in-person LSAT canceled in March or April. Future administration of the LSAT is still scheduled to be held in person as of right now, Thomas said.  Administration of the MCAT has been canceled through May 21. However, three new test dates have been added to the 2020 testing calendar, which will include both morning and afternoon sessions on exam days, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.  These changes to graduate admissions exams will likely alter how applicants are assessed by graduate schools this year, Thomas said. Several graduate schools have adjusted their testing requirements for this years application cycle in an effort to relieve burdens related to the impact of the pandemic.  For professional and graduate school programs within the University of California system, students should inquire with their particular program of interest for the most detailed information regarding this years application process, said UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook.  UCLAs graduate schools are considering modifying their test requirements in the next admissions cycle, said Robin Garrell, dean of the graduate division and vice provost for graduate education, in an emailed statement.  There is no campuswide graduate admission test requirement at UCLA, Garrell added. Test requirements are set by graduate schools and departments for their respective programs.  California medical schools also plan to relax certain requirements for prospective applicants for the upcoming application cycle, according to a joint statement from the Admissions Deans of California Medical Schools, including the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.  The medical schools will accept pass/fail undergraduate grades and applications without an MCAT score from those unable to take the test because of cancellations, the statement added.  The UCLA Anderson School of Management has also modified its application process to address disruptions caused by the pandemic. Test scores are still required for applicants, but the deadline for applications has been extended to June 1, 2020 for this years applicants.  The UCLA School of Law has not relaxed its LSAT requirements at this point because the LSAT-Flex is still available for applicants, said Robert Schwartz, assistant dean of admissions, in an emailed statement. However, for the fall of 2021, the law school will be accepting LSAT scores through the February 2021 administration of the test. Late requests to apply will also be considered on a case by case basis, he added.  The UCLA deans council, graduate council and graduate division have also issued a statement to address the disruptions caused by the pandemic.  Applicants to UCLAs graduate and professional schools will be evaluated holistically, the statement said. Aside from test scores, a combination of personal accomplishments, letters of recommendation, personal statements, academic record and supplemental materials are all considered during admissions decisions.  UCLA admissions bodies will also be accepting classes with pass/no pass grading during this pandemic, the statement added.  While graduate school exams remain a part of the admissions process for certain schools, students will still be able to work on other components of their applications, Thomas said.  Ultimately, students still have a lot of things in their control to put together a great application, he said. They are in control of letters of recommendation, the personal statements they write and (virtual exams) give them a little bit more control over the testing environment.  Amid these changes, UCLA students are still left feeling uncertain about their future and graduate school applications.  Ryan Pan, a fourth-year global studies student, said he has not yet taken the GRE because of the disruptions and uncertainty of spring quarter.  I have been really busy for the spring quarter, especially (with) this as a virtual quarter, adjusting to video lectures, and I also have a part-time job, he said. So I havent really had time (to prepare for the GRE).  Shezan Jimenez, a fourth-year Italian studies student, said in an email that the pandemic has delayed him taking the GRE, which affected his application for a graduate school full-ride scholarship.  Jimenez was scheduled to take the GRE in early March, but the exam was postponed to a much later date because of the impact of the pandemic.  This reschedule caused my scores to come in after March 31 and miss the opportunity for that scholarship, which was really really upsetting because I had everything planned out, he said. Then out of nowhere, it was gone. So now I'm scrambling to see how I will even pay for grad school, if I can go this year.",['cap-olivia-tran'],"['higher-education', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/4.23.news_.gradschooladmissions-01.png

Along with dancing trends, memes and pranks,   TikTok has always provided a platform for sharing new ""life hacks"" and creative do-it-yourself projects  and   its no secret that quarantine life has led to an abundance of recipe videos on ones ""For You"" page.  First, the Korean  dalgona coffee , which has also been dubbed whipped coffee or TikTok coffee, seems to have taken the app by storm, prompting TikTokers from dancers to influencers and even those without the app to give the creamy delicacy a try. As March progressed and stay-at-home orders were solidified, dalgona coffee seems to have kicked off a tidal wave of recipes shared on the app.  In the wake of dalgona coffee's  massive popularity,  a number of other recipes have spread among app users. Often coined as ""food hacks,"" these tutorials allow those stuck at home to clean out their pantries in a somewhat unorthodox way while staying entertained at home and squashing the munchies at the same time.   Dalgona coffee   It seems physically impossible to scroll through TikTok without seeing at least one upload of someone trying out the famed dalgona coffee. And the recipe seems to be popular for good reason: The beverage requires three main ingredients plus milk or a milk alternative, and results in a mixture resembling a coffee milkshake.  It calls for two spoons of instant coffee, two spoons of hot water and two spoons of sugar. The key to the drink is mixing an initially runny mixture even more to achieve a desired whipped consistency. When whisking by hand, it can take upward of half an hour, so using an electric mixer is highly recommended.  The original mixture, dark like black coffee and almost as thin as a cup of water, eventually transforms into a creamy, caramel-like consistency reminiscent of whipped cream. Once the shade turns to a light brown and the texture feels fluffy rather than runny, the mixture can be scooped on top of a glass of ones choice of milk and ice. After a thorough stir, the ingredients fuse together to create an extremely thick drink with a hint of coffee flavor  somewhat like a less icy frappuccino or a frothy milkshake  leaving one feeling extremely full and sugar-satisfied.  Whether a coffee drinker or not, the recipe is definitely worth trying if an electric mixer is nearby. By hand, though, the lengthy process might only be worth the time during quarantine.

Users have shown themselves using only five ingredients to prepare the batch  a cup of peanut butter, a cup of brown sugar, an egg, a teaspoon of baking soda and optional chocolate chips  all easily combined in one bowl.  Without the hassle of classic peanut butter cookie recipes, which call for flour and sometimes both white and brown sugar, those who scroll past this recipe are likely to already have a majority of the ingredients in their pantries. Some users have even shortened the list to only three ingredients, making batter out of just an egg, peanut butter and sugar.  With such a simple list, the only real hurdle is the tedious mixing of the heavy, unwavering peanut butter. Once it's folded in with the other ingredients, though, a batch of about 20 cookies is on its way after baking at 350 degrees for about eight to 12 minutes.  Upon first bite, the suspiciously simple dessert does have one notable characteristic: It's pretty clear that the primary ingredients are peanut butter and brown sugar. The cookie tasted more   like a rolled - together mixture of the two rather than a smoothed out, fully even dessert. Without being masked by the more typical ingredients like flour, my tastebuds felt overpowered by salty, sugary nut butter and sweetness. Some might like that sort of thing, but   it definitely reveals the simplicity of the recipe.  For anyone who already used up their flour experimenting with sourdough or simply wants to try out an easier recipe, the result was worth it for a couple of minutes of effort on the batter. Out of the plethora of TikTok food hacks, this seems to be one of the most rewarding suggestions.   The infamous breakfast sandwich   For this next recipe, think french toast  but savory. In the breakfast egg sandwich hack which has widely garnered praise, TikTok users have been whipping up a classic scrambled egg mix by combining two or three eggs with different seasonings or cheeses they enjoy   and dumping the whisked result into a pan.     Instead of keeping two slices of toast ready beside the stove, the sandwich hack calls for experimenters to dip the bread directly into the scrambled egg mixture while its cooking. The bread should be flipped so both sides are coated in the eggs, with the bottom ridges of both pieces of bread facing each other in the middle.  In a few minutes, as long as the sandwich-to-be is cooking in a nonstick pan, one smooth layer of bread and eggs can be flipped over like a pancake. In a couple more minutes. once the other side is cooked, the two bread slices are folded upon one another with the egg mixture finding itself both between the slices and also coating them. In different variations of recipes, users have been adding bacon or cheeses to their homemade combinations, so it's a good way to use up ingredients that you happen to have on hand.     Tactically, this recipe proved to be the hardest  without the perfect flip in the middle while keeping the entire combination intact as one continuous sheet, the recipe no longer becomes a hack, but more so just a pan full of scrambled toast. My personal attempt resembled the latter, unfortunately leaving me with a cast-iron skillet of soggy toast and eggs that didn't reach their full potential.  [embed url=""https://youtu.be/kmhur1M031s"" contenteditable=""false"" uuid=""061c36a674ce41709ee2c1a9a453f720"" provider=""YouTube""]https://youtu.be/kmhur1M031s[/embed]   Cookie dough for one   This recipe is another free-for-all option in which you can try using   whichever baking ingredients you might have lying around the kitchen. The measurements often vary between     uploads, but across the board, most users have combined four to five tablespoons of flour baked in the oven for a few minutes, a tablespoon or two of melted butter, a tablespoon or two of milk, a tablespoon of brown sugar, a dash of vanilla extract and chocolate chips.  The mixture can easily turn into two kinds of disasters. On one hand, the result could be too doughy, with the flour overconcentrating the bowl, leading to a grainy, flavorless powder. But with an excess of milk and/or butter, the mixture can just as easily turn into a runny, liquidy blend.  The key seems to be finding the right ratio of flour to liquid ingredients, but TikTok users qualm in disagreement over this, with every recipe varying in its suggestions and nearly all comments mentioning that the outcome is not impressive. Based on one trial, it seems as though a single tablespoon of the butter and a tablespoon of the milk  not more  might work best.  The edible cookie dough does have a lot of potential, though. With only measurements for a serving for one, trying the recipe doesnt seem too wasteful, even if the result isnt ideal. Some users have also changed the chocolate chips to a topping of their liking, with one viral video suggesting  edible cake batter  with colorful sprinkles and white chocolate chips.  These concoctions only scratch the surface of TikToks recipe empire  it seems as though a search for any meal in the app will lead to pages full of results.  During quarantine, giving one a try might be the perfect way to use up some old ingredients, find an easy take on a classic snack or at the very least, find a way to pass the time.",['cap-anushka-jain'],"['student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/4.16.quad_.tiktokfoodtrends.illo_.CS_-910x1024.png

Albino Luciano Buendia Pascua, Pascua&#8217;s father, tested positive for the coronavirus in April. He is now hospitalized in an intensive care unit in San Diego.   Over 100,000  people have tested positive for COVID-19 in California.  More than 30 COVID-19 cases  have been reported in the UCLA community, but the families of UCLA community members, including Pascua&#8217;s father, have not been counted.  Her father, a 61-year-old nurse, first showed symptoms on April 14, a week after his colleague tested positive for the virus. On April 16, he stayed in the emergency room overnight to await test results.  The next day, Pascua&#8217;s mother got a call from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirming her husband tested positive.  Not long after, he was moved to the ICU, intubated and put into a medically induced coma. He has been in the ICU since.  The diagnosis came just after Pascua canceled her housing contract and moved home after UCLA  announced  spring quarter would be online. The adjustment to home life and her father&#8217;s condition all at once was difficult, she said.  &#8220;It was very much a shock,&#8221; Pascua said.  Since then, Pascua said her and her family&#8217;s lives have been emotionally and financially upended.  Phoebe Cinco, Pascua&#8217;s sister, said before their father&#8217;s hospitalization, their family was close and spent time together.  &#8220;It's like a big cloud hanging over the house,&#8221; Cinco said. &#8220;And everywhere else it's bright and sunny.&#8221;  Pascua&#8217;s family has been hanging onto daily and hourly updates on his condition from the hospital, Cinco said. A lot of the updates they hear about her father have been bad, she said.  &#8220;It's kind of like a repeated trauma when you keep hearing, &#8216;Oh, he&#8217;s not doing good today,&#8217;&#8221; Cinco said.  Apart from a glimmer of hope in early May when her father could move his right hand, his condition has only worsened, Pascua said.  The family often gathers late at night for video calls with Pascua&#8217;s father, which are coordinated by nurses. By their second call, they were shocked by his weight loss. He has been mostly unresponsive during the calls, despite the family urging him to blink or move his head, Pascua said.  &#8220;Sometimes, even that would be too much,&#8221; Pascua said.  Pascua has taken on the responsibility of updating family members and friends about his condition. She tries to give updates in her mother&#8217;s place to lighten the burden on her mother, Pascua said.  Although Pascua and her family appreciate people reaching out to them, it often causes her family more stress to discuss her father&#8217;s situation, she said.  Pascua is taking four classes this quarter but said she has not notified any of her professors about her situation because she does not feel comfortable accepting accommodations.  School responsibilities have not kept her mind off the stress of her father&#8217;s condition, as she has heard some professors suggest, Pascua said. Still, she has worked hard and done well this quarter to honor her parents, especially her father, she said.  &#8220;They fought for my education, so it's important for me to make it worthwhile,&#8221; Pascua said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a motivating factor, but it's very, very hard.&#8221;  Pascua&#8217;s father immigrated from the Philippines to San Diego in 1989 for better economic opportunities. He held a law degree from the Philippines, but since his degree was not transferable to the United States, he decided to go into nursing. He has worked in the nursing field for 27 years.  As the family&#8217;s main provider, Pascua&#8217;s father dedicated his life to giving his children the opportunity to support themselves, Pascua said.  With Pascua&#8217;s father in the hospital, her family now worries about its financial security, Pascua said. Her mother is unable to access her father&#8217;s assets because Pascua&#8217;s parents are legally unmarried, making their current expenses a challenge.  Pascua&#8217;s parents planned to remarry and have a big wedding after her undergraduate studies, Pascua said. Pascua also planned to go to medical school after graduating.  &#8220;Everything that (my father) does, ... it was an investment,&#8221; Pascua said. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a big interruption in this plan that we had for all of us.&#8221;  Seeing social media posts of friends meeting up, going out and breaking social distancing protocols took a toll on her mental health, enough that she had to restrict her use of social media, Pascua said.  Cinco said Pascua is strong and does not often vocalize her struggles. Nonetheless, Cinco has noticed how difficult it is for Pascua.  &#8220;You can tell that it does drain on her,&#8221; Cinco said. &#8220;You can just tell from her eyes.&#8221;  Katon Minhas, a fourth-year cognitive science student, has also been personally impacted by COVID-19.  His mother, Jennifer &#8211; a nurse in Seattle &#8211; tested positive in March.  Minhas thought he also contracted the virus after experiencing coughing and a fever shortly after his mother tested positive. However, he could not get tested because of the limited number of tests in Seattle at the time, he said.  Being denied testing was infuriating, Minhas said.  &#8220;The whole point of testing is to confirm for your own safety, but basically it felt like they were just dismissing us and being like, &#8216;Just assume you have it, good luck,&#8217;&#8221; he said.  Minhas made a full recovery from his symptoms within a few days.  His mother also recovered from COVID-19 within a few weeks. However, she has permanent lung scarring from the virus, Minhas said.  Pascua said COVID-19&#8217;s impact felt abstract and intangible to her until her father contracted COVID-19.  However, that changed when she retrieved her father&#8217;s phone from the hospital. There were hundreds of messages from people in his life wanting to know how he was doing, Pascua said.  &#8220;That's just the one person,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can't imagine how it's like for all the families who are being affected, and all the people who can't voice their experiences.&#8221;  Like her father, Cinco is a nurse in San Diego.  &#8220;As a nurse in the emergency department, we're always preparing for our PPE, or protective equipment,&#8221; Cinco said. &#8220;And we see it as, 'OK, it's another day on the job, to protect yourself.'&#8221;  Now that she is personally affected by COVID-19, her attitude has changed, Cinco said.  &#8220;It's a different view now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Like every life is even more precious than it was before.&#8221;  Pascua said regardless of its extensive and lasting impact, she expects popular culture to eventually trivialize the pandemic.  &#8220;It's going to be just a tragic reminder every single time I scroll (online) and I see someone joking about it or someone minimizing the impact that it had because they didn't experience it themselves,&#8221; she said.

Unfortunately, this question doesn't only stand in emptying college towns, but virtually everywhere in the United States where  stay-at-home   orders  have been placed.  A recent National Small Business Association  poll  revealed that more than 75% of small-business owners expressed a large concern toward COVID-19's economic impact. This sentiment is clear when paired with the finding that almost half of small businesses across the nation have seen   a decrease in demand.  Westwood businesses are no strangers to this sentiment. Sam Langford, the owner of Espresso Profeta in Westwood Village, feels the upcoming months will bring many hardships.  ""I honestly do not even know if we will survive as a small business. Im sure every single other small business is also wondering if they can stay open,"" Langford said.  For those who wish to lend a hand to local businesses, The Quad has compiled ways to aid local businesses and service workers that may need extra support.      Toggle the options on the map above to see which stores in Westwood are still open. Black pins represent closed stores, while green pins represent open stores. See information here that isnt correct? Fill out  this form  if you have updated information    To start, restaurants are noticeably taking a heavy hit with fewer people willing to venture out.     ""There are no people on the streets now. ... So far, we've seen business decrease by 70% on a single day,"" said Robert Larach, the manager of Enzo's Pizzeria.    The best way to support restaurants is to continue ordering food from them. Many restaurants have switched to delivery and/or takeout.     Don't forget to tip the workers extra to show your appreciation, especially if they've provided sustenance on all your late-night adventures at UCLA.  If youre not in the Westwood area, you can look up your favorite local restaurants for their updated business operations and hours to make sure they remain supported too.  In addition, some restaurants are also selling their  food stock  s  to cover falling sales.    ""Weve tried to incorporate being a small market, like selling oat and hemp milk, coffee beans and bread,"" Langford said.  Consider skipping the crowded supermarkets and instead, buy produce from local restaurants in need.  Another simple way to help keep small businesses afloat is purchasing gift cards or certificates. Not only can you use them later, but you're providing payments that these businesses are being cut off from. If you want to go an extra step, give the gift cards to the hardworking service workers around you. Help out your local grocery store clerk, postman/woman or food delivery person.    USA Todays parent company Gannett recently set up  supportlocal.usatoday.com , a donation website that maps out thousands of small businesses across the country to purchase gift cards from. More businesses in various locations are being added every day.  Alternatively, you could donate payments to small businesses.  In a recent  Instagram post , Michelle Obama suggested sending payments to businesses that you made appointments for  like hair and nail salons, barbers and physical therapists  as if your appointment wasn't canceled.   Without a steady income, many of these businesses arent sure if theyll make it to the other side, so any payment helps.  Donations could also go to nonprofit charities and foundations that have stepped up to consolidate and distribute funding to businesses in need. The  Restaurant Workers' Community Foundation  is a notable example, using donations to assist restaurant workers, grant zero-interest loans to restaurants in need and aid other nonprofits supporting restaurant workers.  Other California-based funds for small businesses include  OC Community Resilience Fund  and the  Give2SF  fund. More funds across the nation can be found on Candid.orgs  list of coronavirus relief funds .  If you would like to help small businesses on a larger level, another option is to call up  state representatives  and voice your concerns.  It is during these unprecedented times that expressing our appreciation for the people that support us every day, from the neighborhood mailman to the pizza delivery person, is more important than ever. Even while maintaining social distance, we can show up for each other.",['cap-cecile-wu'],"['student-life', 'quad', 'westwood-quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/4.1.quad_.helpinglocalbusinesses-01-597x1024.png

The 2019-2020 Daily Bruin Editorial Boards recent  piece  claimed that the Cultivating Unity for Bruins Referendum's failure resulted from nothing more than students financial concerns during this pandemic.  As students whove faced bigotry in response to the CUB campaign, its difficult not to critique an editorial board known for its complete  absence of Black students in leadership  as such hurtful claims are made, dismissing students of color who experience daily microaggressions and violence. While it may seem as though platforms like Reddit are void of bigotry, this is only because moderators wipe clean the countless attacks targeted at students.  Be it the  impersonation of a Black woman running for office , a  racist zoom-bombing  during a USAC meeting, the demonization of a slate comprised of students of color through coded language and dog whistles, or  revealing a queer student government officials dating profile , bigotry may not have been the primary factor in CUBs defeat, but it certainly wasnt absent online.  To make matters worse, instead of addressing these incidents, this years editorial board has provided a platform to enable such attacks.  The editorial board has persistently attacked student representatives for  baseless evaluations  of their personalities, and demonized students who arent direct entry"" students through disturbing  evaluations of transfers  and students who havent served in ""traditional"" settings. Furthermore, by publishing false information such as claiming the cost of developing a Black Resource Center to be $182,000, substantially lower than any estimate on the  same pie chart  the editorial board cites, the editorial board fosters a narrative regarding CUB thats been twisted to claim that funds could simply be obtained via other avenues.  Ultimately, the editorial board must write truthfully when it comes to referendums and student government representatives.  This years editorial board fails to recognize major facets of CUB and does not acknowledge all marginalized communities with stakes in CUB. This reflects gross incompetence and presents misleading information to the larger UCLA community. Through the editorial boards same desire for USAC to improve, its our hope that the new editorial board will hold itself accountable for its mistakes, rather than  citing Reddit screenshots  for its latest appeal to a narrow audience.  But, old habits die hard.  &nbsp;   Alexandria Davis, 2019-2020 Chair of Afrikan Student Union    Simone Walker, 2020-2021 Co-Chair of Afrikan Student Union    Alex Dunkwu, 2020-2021 Co-Chair of Afrikan Student Union    Kelechi Iheanacho, 2019-2020 Undergraduate Students Association Cultural Affairs Commissioner     Naomi Riley, 2020-2021 Undergraduate Students Association President     Milagros Martinez Stordeur, 2019-2020 Transfer Leadership Coalition Co-Chair    Zuleika Bravo, 2019-2020 Transfer Leadership Coalition Co-Chair    Karina Arzate-Arenivaz, 2020-2021 Transfer Leadership Coalition Co-Chair    Bradley Alvarado, 2020-2021 Transfer Leadership Coalition Co-Chair    Kokonow Kinney, 2019-2020 Chairman of American Indian Student Association    Josephine Flores, 2019-2021 President of Samahang Pilipino    Phil Timoteo, 2019-2020 President of Pacific Islands Student Association    Joseph Nguyn, 2019-2020 President of the Vietnamese Student Union    Jason Tun V, 2019-2020 External Vice President of the Vietnamese Student Union    Vivyana Prado, 2019-2020 Chair of MEChA de UCLA    Sharon Yuen, 2019-2020 Director of Asian Pacific Coalition    Faatimah Mahadi 2019-2020 External Vice President of Muslim Student Association    Nieves Winslow, 2019-2020 Executive Director of Queer Alliance ","['cap-transfer-leadership-coalition', 'cap-the-mother-organizations']","['community', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/letters-to-the-editor.png

The NCAA Division I Council voted Wednesday to allow football and both basketball programs student-athletes to return to campus beginning June 1, according to a report from Yahoo Sports Pete Thamel. The move is potentially a signal of an incremental push for collegiate sports to return for the fall after the NCAA imposed a moratorium on all athletic activities until May 31.   UCLA Athletics did not release a statement on the decision, but a department spokesperson said the universitys policy come June 1 will be dependent on where campus and local public health orders are at that time.  The college football season is slated to begin on Aug. 29, with UCLA scheduled to take on New Mexico State at the Rose Bowl to open its 2020 campaign. Whether fans will be allowed in the stands remains an unanswered question.  Despite the NCAAs decision, UCLA has already announced that in-person classes would be suspended through summer session C. Whether UCLA will allow students to return to campus for the fall quarter still remains up in the air, while the California State University campuses have all announced that classes will remain virtual to start the new school year.   The NCAAs decision will impact CSU schools that also field Division I FBS football programs  San Jose State, Fresno State and San Diego State.   UCLA suspended all athletic events beginning March 12, and with additional cancelations from the Pac-12 and NCAA, both the mens and womens basketball programs were unable to complete their postseason competitions. UCLA football had its spring practices and game canceled as well.   While Wednesdays decision to allow student-athletes to return is only applicable to three sports, Thamel reported the NCAA will likely hold a vote for other sports teams as soon as possible.

The Undergraduate Students Association Elections Board held its annual debate for the spring USAC election over livestream with over 200 online viewers. This years event was co-hosted by the Daily Bruin and featured 24 out of 30 candidates.    The majority of the debate focused on contested positions including president, internal vice president, external vice president, Facilities commissioner and others. Uncontested candidates were given a one-minute opening statement before being dismissed.    Many candidates focused on the feasibility of their opponents platforms, USACs transparency and the future of student fees.    This election has around double the number of contested positions than the 2019 election had, which led to a more contentious debate. Three candidates ran for president in 2019, and five are currently running in 2020.    Referendums   A USAC referendum is a proposal to raise student fees for a specific goal or policy. Referendums include a 25% return to financial aid, so low-income students are not affected by a fee increase. Students directly vote to decide if a referendum will be implemented. There are two referendums on the ballot this year.  The debate included the two proposed referendums: Cultivating Unity for Bruins Referendum and Good Clothes Good People Basic Needs Referendum. Andrew Raychawdhuri, a Daily Bruin opinion columnist, represented the opposition to the CUB, though this does not represent the official stance of the paper.  The CUB referendum  would fund the creation of a Black Resource Center with a programming budget, pay the rent of the Transfer Student Center and create more spaces for meditation.    Alexandria Davis, candidate representative for CUB and chairperson of the Afrikan Student Union at UCLA, said that a $45 rise in student fees to support the referendum is justified because the issues represented in CUB have needed to be addressed for years.    Raychawdhuri said that there is no urgency to pass the referendum in the middle of a pandemic, as students will not be able to utilize the benefits of the referendum for the foreseeable future.    Davis said that CUB has been pushed off for years and must be implemented as soon as possible.    I see the CUB referenda as the only way to restore these historic inequalities, she said.   The GCGP referendum would fund the addition of school supplies and hygiene products to USAC's GCGP redistribution center. Items in the redistribution center, including clothes, wheelchairs, umbrellas and more, are available for all undergraduate students to borrow for free.   Elizabeth Hanczor, a Daily Bruin opinion columnist, served as the opposition to GCGP, though this does not represent the official stance of the paper. She said that GCGP should not be addressed as a referendum because it is small enough to be covered entirely by USAC surplus funds.    Sneha Thirkannad, the candidate representative for GCGP, said the USAC surplus changes each year.    We cant rely on something if we dont know how much there is to offer, she said. Were asking you to pay 99 cents, and we will be able to provide necessities for thousands of students.    President    Presidential candidate   Naomi Riley said that her fellow candidate Orion Smedley is not educated on issues relating to USAC transparency and budget reports from funded groups, like committees under the UCLA Community Programs Office.    Smedley said that USAC should    continue to withhold fees from CPO groups    until they present budget reports.    We dont just give up, said Smedley, currently general representative 2 and a third-year physics student. We still have the ability to keep withholding fees from them.    Riley also said that candidate Josuel Vasquez, who promised to cancel all student fees amid the COVID-19 pandemic, does not understand the nuances associated with student fees.    Vasquez, a third-year mathematics student,   said that the only fair plan is to cancel student fees, including the potential new fees that would come with the referendum on the ballot.    If you go to the store, and you dont get what you paid for, you get your money back, Vasquez said.      Riley, the current USAC Academic Affairs commissioner and a third-year political science student, said that the CUB referendum is long overdue and should happen regardless of students not being able to utilize it immediately. Following through with the CUB referendum is contingent upon collecting student fees.    Presidential candidate   Aniq Chunara said that   though canceling student fees is logical, Vasquez lacks a direct plan to do so.    I would like to see some concrete details, said Chunara, a second-year political science student.    Presidential candidate and third-year business economics student   Josh Feldman called for Chunara, who served on the USA Judicial Board, to resign from his position if he is planning to continue to run for president. However, Chunara said he has already stepped down and is eligible to run.    Facilities commissioner    Another contentious discussion took place when Facilities commissioner   candidates Draco Tong and Sachi Cooper criticized each other's platforms and qualifications.    Cooper, a second-year geography student, disapproved of Tongs platforms, stating that his plan to implement solar panels on campus is too ambitious and vague, especially considering UCLA already failed to meet its goal of zero waste by 2020.    Tong, a second-year electrical engineering student, said that though his plan is ambitious, he believes that his engineering background is more applicable for the position than Coopers background.   Cooper, a member of the Facilities commission, said she would focus on collaboration with administration and students from diverse communities to address sustainability issues.   International student representative    Similarly, international student representative candidate Nadine Avari said her fellow candidate Nox Yangs proposal to establish a multicultural center is not feasible. Candidate Bakur Madini added that he disapproves of the proposals need to raise student fees.    Yang said that there are available spaces on the Hill that can house the center. She added that international students pay three times the tuition of in-state students, and any additional funds needed should be taken from these tuitions.    International students face many questions for next year, including the chance of returning to school despite travel bans, maintaining visa statuses and more. Madini said his solution is to push administration to make a plan for international students, but Avari said that would not be enough.    Were all uncertain, but the UC administration is just as uncertain as us, she said.    Internal vice president    The two candidates for internal vice president, Emily Hong Van Luong and Brandon Broukhim, entered a debate over what the position demands a focus on.    Transparency is the IVPs greatest responsibility, said Broukhim, who serves as general representative 3 on USAC.    He added that the USAC meeting livestream    USAC Live!    is a laptop in the corner of the room that produces low-quality video and audio. Broukhim said he   wants to create a more effective livestream to make meetings fully accessible.    The issue, however, is not the quality of the livestream, said Luong, a member of the internal vice president office and a third-year communication student. People are more engaged through office hours, which she plans to hold frequently, she said.    Broukhim said students did not come to his office hours and have been more engaged over Zoom, adding that he wants to maintain digital accessibility even when students return to campus.    Each candidate voiced doubts over the others special project. Broukhim said that Luongs plan to stabilize rent for students living in Westwood apartments is unachievable, while his plan to implement charging stations across campus is more feasible.    The city cant accomplish it, the state cant accomplish it, I cant understand how USAC will solve it, he said.    Luong said that though her plan is more ambitious, it addresses a real problem,   unlike Broukhims plan.    It doesnt solve a student need, she said. Students are facing an academic inequality because they cant afford laptops, not because they cant find places to charge them.    Voting for the 2020 USAC election will open Monday on MyUCLA and run through May 8.

Fresh meat joins the game of cat and mouse  and they're not clowning around.  Last week's return of ""Killing Eve"" explored a shaken Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh) navigating her life after the chaos of season two's finale, but this week offers a new slate of characters. Sunday's episode presented Eves return to her former detective spirit and the entrance of Kennys sister, Geraldine (Gemma Whelan) and his boss at Bitter Pill, Jamie (Danny Sapani). Alongside fresh characters, the familiar dynamics between Eve and Carolyn (Fiona Shaw), as well as Villanelle (Jodie Comer) and Konstantin (Kim Bodnia) brought a playful dynamic.  Despite these new circumstances, characters   and the recent loss of loved ones, it appears that these individuals have failed to learn from their mistakes and are en route to repeat them this season.   [Related:    Killing Eve season 3 recap  episode 1: Slowly Slowly Catchy Monkey   ]   Kenny's death has been horrifically signed off as a suicide, but there's comfort when Eve reacts to his death with the same vengeful spirit she had for Frank. Eves newly reignited motivation to investigate the Twelve exposes her unhealthy coping mechanisms and a revived lack   of faith in authority. Its soon   revealed that she secretly took Kennys phone from his desk and strikes a deal with Kennys boss   to exchange the phone for information.  But when Eve storms out from what appears to be the beginning of a season-long partnership, Jamie calls her out on her attachment to the investigation and inability to work with others. Hopefully      with his detached and upfront demeanor  Jamie could potentially serve as Eves compass back to an investigative life without Villanelle in the remaining episodes.  On the other hand, Kennys sister Geraldine enters the picture as a more naive, trusting character in the series. She emanates the same positive energy as Kenny, but  due to her lack of involvement in the investigations  proves to be an easy target when she unwittingly brings Konstantins wire into Carolyns home.  The bug overhears Eve proposing to investigate the Twelve with Carolyn again using Kennys findings and information on his phone  .   The scene marks the return of Eve and Carolyns working relationship and the writers' fear of taking risks to explore new relationships.    But it's Shaw who brings the best of her character to the table in these moments as she expertly balances Carolyns denial of grief and her struggle with her loss of power. Shaw achieves this with subtle character movements that embody Carolyn's irreverent spirit while grieving    after all, who else can eat sandwiches alone in her car at work while blasting sad, orchestral music.  Speaking of old habits dying hard, Villanelle's return to the Twelve turns out to be a challenge for her. Now that she wants to move up the ranks, she is forced to play their games to prove shes capable of control. Shes tasked with mentoring a new assassin recruit, Felix (Stefan Iancu), and through him the essence of her feelings and relationship with Eve are explicitly stated.   [Related:    Movie review: Tigertail offers intimate look into family relationships across generations   ]   It's revealed that Felix had also fallen in love with someone and had killed for him, but was rejected as a result. Commonalities between the two aside, Villanelle does not hesitate to kill him and their shared target when Felix fails to meet expectations at a birthday party when they're disguised as clowns.  Though a comedic moment, Villanelle's actions raises doubts regarding her ability to rise to power if she continually chooses to fulfill her own whims. If she continues the way she is, theres a strong chance that she'll always be clawing for power and end up being murdered once she, or someone else, loses patience.  But if there is one character who always manages to play the long con, it's Konstantin, and he characteristically returns to Villanelle's life by surprising her at her apartment.   He informs Villanelle that Eve is still alive and reveals that he never stopped working for the Twelve. Enraged, Villanelle kicks Konstantin out, but hints of their playful relationship shine through. While this   rapport sometimes comes off as drawn out, it provides fun banter while still moving the plot forward.      Overall, episode two of ""Killing Eve"" answered some questions but failed to provide a driving mystery. Despite the new introductions, the plot treads on thin ice as writers continue to drag out the dealings of the Twelve   without adding anything but characters. Hopefully, these new personalities will ramp up tension and bring new information to the table, especially since a fourth season has already been given a green light.    Here's to the rest of this seasons writing biting off a bit more to deliver the franchise's promised intrigue.",['cap-jane-ngyuen'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/IMG_0042.jpg

They also asked that all UC campuses divest from the UCPD.&nbsp;    Thursdays protest followed a string of protests across the city and country after George Floyd died May 25 in Minneapolis police custody.    Organizers also called for the arrest of officers involved in the deaths of black people in police custody and that the city of Los Angeles reallocate funding from policing and incarceration to education and employment programs. They also called for the dismissal   of LAPD Chief Michael Moore and the removal of the National Guard from Westwood.&nbsp;    Protesters chanted the names of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd as they crossed South   Campus.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    About 20  @UCLA  Residential Life staff members are present, distributing water and snacks to protesters.  pic.twitter.com/ZiaL1VWNEd    Justin Jung (@justinjungDB)  June 4, 2020        After a 60-second moment of silence for victims of police brutality, the crowd marched down Charles E. Young Drive past UCLA Murphy Hall. Several Santa Monica Big Blue Bus   drivers pulled over in support of the marchers.    Outside UCPD headquarters, several speakers addressed the crowd, read poetry, spoke out against racial discrimination and led chants decrying racial discrimination.    Trisden Shaw, president of the BGSA, spoke to the crowd in front of Royce Hall about the importance of nonviolence in communicating the protesters message.&nbsp;    We have demands, and nothing or no one should be able to dilute that message, and that is what violence does, said Shaw, a graduate student of African American studies. We are here to expose this anti-blackness, which we see each and every day.   Shaw also criticized UCLA leadership for its history of campuswide anti-blackness.&nbsp;  Theres a negligence of (Chancellor) Gene Block.  He may not be sufficient enough as a leader of the No. 1 public institution, Shaw said. Weve been asking for a Black Resource Center, weve had a number of meetings with (Block). We have not had any type of progression, and I think enough is enough.  Shaw said Blocks recent statement to the black community was a performative apology, and said the community will not be satisfied until action is taken.  UCLA is committed to working with ASU and BGSA to find resources for a Black Resource Center in the center of campus, said spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez in an emailed statement.   ASU Chair Alexandria Davis called on UCLA to investigate the LAPDs use of the Jackie Robinson Stadium parking lot as a detention center Monday. She said demonstrators should continue to protest until these demands are met.&nbsp;    [Related link:    UCLA-leased Jackie Robinson Stadium facilities used by LAPD to detain protestors   ]    The university   has essentially failed us with a lack of support for final exams for students going through this time, but also the usage of a UCLA facility to detain and house folks, Davis said. We demand that UCLA does investigate, because they have a responsibility to their students.    Naomi Riley, the 2020-2021 USAC president, said that her office is   in full support of the protest   and following the leadership of ASU and BGSA.&nbsp;    Riley said the protest addresses a pattern of brutality and discrimination within the police force in Los Angeles, extending beyond the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.    Theres research that shows that UCPD disproportionately targets students of color, specifically black students, said Riley, a third-year political science student. These are not random, isolated incidents. They're incidents that occur all across the nation. ... We should continue to support black students in any way that they deem necessary.    UCPD declined to immediately respond to a request for comment.    Sydney Cattouse, a second-year public affairs student who attended the protest, said the demonstration is also meant to draw attention to the systematic violence black people face.&nbsp;    (We are) bringing attention to the systematic killings that have been happening due to state violence, Cattouse said. This has happened for years and years on end.

Eve can't have her cake and eat it too.  The issue was asked and answered in Sundays episode ""Still Got It"" with a multi-timeline exploration of ""Killing Eve""'s main cast of characters.  Eve (Sandra Oh) has long grappled with making work and home life operate in harmony  and in a heart-to-heart between herself and her new coworker Jaime (Danny Sapani) at the beginning of the episode, an answer was promised. But after celebrating her birthday with a rooftop breakdown, smashing a cake and accosting a worn-out teddy bear, Eve makes a rare rebuff of work exploits and heads to Poland to get her husband Niko (Owen McDonnell) back. Her choice comes as no surprise thanks to a few well-placed text exchanges between Niko and Eve, but it nonetheless represents a triumphant character growth in Eve.   [Related:    Killing Eve season 3 recap  episode 3: Meetings Have Biscuits   ]   But Eve wasnt the only character to exhibit change. Multiple simultaneous timelines check in with the main cast of characters, and in doing so, Villanelles (Jodie Comer) playful hedonism was challenged for the first time. Torn between a big promotion with the Twelve and her loyalty to Konstantin and his promise to find her family, Villanelle hesitated during an assassination.  Following Bertha (Rebecca Saire)  the wife of the Twelves accountant  to her country house in France, Villanelle foiled her own opportunity for a swift kill. She dropped a pair of sharp garden shears to fully embrace a hug from Bertha, and the subsequent spirited jaunt through the garden was an assertion that maybe Villanelle wouldnt follow through after all. But Bertha's perceived security didn't last long, and Villanelle swiftly returned to expected form to strangle her. But she was rattled in a way that previously only Eve could induce. Finally, shes off her game.  The hesitation  though momentary  does more than make Villanelle penetrable. It begs the question of who she kills for. In earlier seasons, even Villanelle herself seemed uninterested in knowing who it was that contracted her kills  she simply liked killing and the money that came with it. But now her motives have become muddled. Her characterization as a psychopath has always been the apparent driving force behind Villanelles thirst for blood, but her hesitation seems to be a sign of humanity peeking through her waning loyalty to former and current employers.  With more than one dramatic question after another, ""Killing Eve"" has stayed true to its network drama form and saved the marquee kill for the last five minutes of the episode.   The timelines simultaneously following each character clumsily converged to reveal Dasha (Harriet Walter) posing as a townsperson in Poland. It took only seconds for the pieces of the story to come together, and by the time they did, Niko was writhing on the ground with a pitchfork in his neck.  Unlike Kenny's death, however, Niko's death isn't left unexplained. After the violently romantic encounter between Eve and Villanelle on a city bus in London, Dasha was contracted to drive a wedge between Eve and Villanelle. And with Nikos death appearing to be the work of Villanelle, it will most certainly achieve just that. But explanation or not, the bungling of timelines diffused what could have been one of the most emotionally wrought scenes in the series.   [Related:    TV Review: Layers of irony in Never Ricking Morty derail narration, criticize shows fanbase   ]   What is often a delightfully suspenseful and visually rewarding episode structure in other series was overshadowed by confusing time overlaps and poorly mounted stakes, ultimately undermining the central themes of Sunday's episode. But it wasnt the fault of the filmmakers. In Still Got It,"" the show continued to find color and style in a morbid premise. The many timelines came with a myriad of prototypical establishing shots  one in Poland, one in Barcelona, another in London  each one more beautiful than the next.  And the dark greys of Eves London juxtaposed with the oranges of Villanelles Barcelona subtly explored a thesis about two women who approach life differently. Yet not even skillful craft could save poorly paced writing. Sundays episode tried something structurally different  but it didnt work.  ""Still Got It"" felt like a skittish and mechanical means to a very tragic end. The story skipping around from one place to the next satisfied a few lingering loose ends, but not fully. The episode posed more questions than it answered, and between confusing timelines and diffusion of tension, the momentous dynamic of Villanelles psyche and Nikos death were lost in the shuffle. While good filmmaking made up for sterile writing, Nikos death still felt more like a sudden and unwarranted story grenade than a delicious Killing Eve trademark twist.  Eve may have been hellbent on making things work this week, but with a wildly horrific birthday surprise, shell never even know what the cake tastes like.",['cap-annika-carlson'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/killing-eve.jpg

Killing Eve finally committed a major broadcast blunder    a boring episode.  Sunday nights show Are You From Pinner? devoted the entire hour to Villanelles brief stint at home in Russia. The homecoming, which was obviously an attempted deep dive into Villanelle (Jodie Comer), fell flat.   The interest in watching 60 minutes of Killing Eve relies on voyeuristic stakes  e  ach episode promises an answer to the question of who Villanelle will kill next and in what ways it will be both gruesome and individually fashionable.  But in this episode, no such stakes ever existed.  Drowned out by run-of-the-mill blocking, poor set design, and an ultimately unrewarding story, the lack of stakes and traditional ""Killing Eve""-isms  Carolyn's dry wit, Eve's lovable obsession with death and the intrigue of an unidentified international crime organization  made Are You From Pinner? a massive waste of time.   [Related:    Killing Eve season 3 recap  episode 4: Still Got It   ]   Season three has begun to feel like one big endeavor in humanizing its female characters. And while the urgent need to present nuanced women on screen is a mission typically well served by Killing Eve, the successful fulfillment of womanhood as seen with Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw) didnt work in this episode. Carolyn could be understood only when juxtaposed with the other core characters, but executing the same sort of subtlety in Villanelle just didnt make sense without the presence of Eve (Sandra Oh) as her narrative foil.  It all began with Villanelle kicking rocks on her way up to a graying ramshackle farmhouse where she found herself in the middle of what was essentially a scene from a stage play plopped into a television screen. The eccentric inhabitants  ranging from a never before seen stepfather to her stepbrother's conspiracy theorist girlfriend    entered and exited the kitchen, introducing themselves to a sitting Villanelle. As each member of the cast revealed their relation and occupation, their individually annoying demeanors clarified that by the end of the episode, Villanelle would kill at least one of them.  But despite the single quirk that defined each character, the interactions were still bland. Monotonous costumes and poor definitive blocking muddled up the dynamics of what would have otherwise landed as humor. So when Villanelle ended up killing all of them  her mother, stepfather, stepbrother and   his   girlfriend  the deaths didnt settle as solidly as the typical Killing Eve kills.   [Related:    Killing Eve season 3 recap  episode 3: Meetings Have Biscuits   ]   There were, however, a few momentary bright spots during the episode, one being Villanelles brother Pytor's (Rob Feldman) introduction and survival. Chock full of the same facial contortions and dry wit, Pytor was an effortless and staunchly believable empathetic counterpart to Villanelle. Between their conversation over couch smashing and Pytors sweet side-hug over lunch, Pytor proved himself to be the only valuable plot device to come out of tonights episode.  The second and final noteworthy moment in an otherwise bland hour of television was Elton Johns musical motif. Villanelles younger stepbrother Borka (Temirlan Blaev) had a childlike obsession with the rock legend, and Villanelle humored his love by sporting a short strawberry-blonde wig and heart-shaped sunglasses. Later, the family danced along to Borka's passionate lip sync of ""Crocodile Rock"" in one of the episode's more playful moments. Seeing Villanelle in the middle of swaying arms and terrible dance moves was laughable, but the initial novelty soon wore off with a quick return to the dry supporting characters and beige interiors.    Muted blues occasionally punched through the tan and brown  the walls of the house, Villanelles sweater, an '80s tracksuit  but the stylized interpretation of rural Russia lacks the typical pizazz of Killing Eve and only adds to the episode's jarring effect.    With essential core characters left out this week, the color was sucked out of the story and the set design simply followed suit. A tiny bit of punch from the Elton John classic Crocodile Rock during a card game and Patrick Bettys Black Blues over a lunch outing attempted to compensate for the painfully khaki color scheme by adding auditory color. But the attempt, much like the episode as a whole, failed to fully achieve what it set out to do.  While it was only a matter of time before Villanelle's mysterious past was solved, a single narrative with only two payoff points was a deflating and unsatisfying exploration of an incredibly complex character. In a series set on scaffolding stories around eight episodes each season, theres just not enough real estate for an hour-long homecoming.  It seems the writers put the entire episode out on a limb that Villanelle has grown enough to carry an episode all by herself  but she hasnt. Jodie Comer did manage to put on her usual nuanced apathy with a bit more care in this episode, but the series isnt called Following Villanelle, its Killing Eve. And the titular character's presence in Sundays episode was sorely missed.  Without the charming dullness of Eve, not even Sir Elton John could save Villanelle from assuming the role of the boring character.",['cap-annika-carlson'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/killing-eve-1.jpg

Cronin took home the John R. Wooden Pac-12 Coach of the Year award for the 2019-2020 season, the conference announced Monday. The first-year coach became the sixth UCLA mens basketball coach to earn the honor and the first since Ben Howland won it in 2006.  Four of the Bruins previous five coaches won the award  which is named after the winningest coach in UCLA history  with Alford being the lone exception.  Cronins win is also the third conference coach of the year award of his career, as he won it in the Ohio Valley Conference and American Athletic Conference in 2006 and 2014, respectively. He most recently won the 2018 Sporting News Coach of the Year award after leading Cincinnati to a regular season AAC title.  UCLA got off to a 8-9 start under Cronin this season, but an 11-3 stretch to wrap up the regular season launched the Bruins up to the No. 2 seed in the Pac-12 tournament.

Among the many contestants who auditioned for the latest season of the singing competition is second-year   global jazz studies student Sophia Wackerman. Growing up, Wackerman   said she was constantly surrounded   by music. Her father is a drummer and her late mother was a singer, which she said sparked her joy for singing early on, and she joined orchestras and show choir throughout junior high and high school. Wackerman said she was invited to audition for ""American Idol""   after receiving a direct message from a producer of the show,   who expressed interest in the videos she posted of herself singing. After she auditioned, she received a golden ticket from the judges, making it through to Hollywood week.    &#8220;It was crazy, like absolutely wild,"" Wackerman said. ""Getting to perform in front of Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan just because they're such giants in the music industry, and I've been such a fan of them for so long.&#8221;     Outside of the actual performance, Wackerman said the audition day involved interviews in which she was asked questions such as why she got involved in music and what she hoped to gain from competing. She said the interviews would become  repetitive and confusing at times, which required her to quickly   learn to be more coherent in her responses. Learning to word her responses well and overcoming nerves that jumbled her thoughts were important for her to tell her story as clearly and honestly as possible, Wackerman said.     [Related:  Student attributes success in &#8216;So You Think You Can Dance&#8217; to hard work, drive ]      The singer said throughout the audition process she was able to apply professionalism skills she has learned from her education. Especially during her interviews and while she interacted with the judges, Wackerman said she was able to contain her enthusiasm and present herself professionally because of how she has been trained to be when pursuing her career. On top of that, the emphasis on collaboration over competition in UCLA&#8217;s jazz program taught her to focus more on learning from, rather than competing with, others during her audition, Wackerman said.  ""Going into the competition, I really had the mindset of knowing I'm only going to get better from being around these other talented musicians,"" Wackerman said. ""I just would kind of go with the flow and try to soak up all the knowledge that I could.&#8221;  [caption caption=""Outside of the actual audition day performance, Sophia Wackerman said she had to answer questions which would at times become repetitive and confusing.

Isen said participating in the same competition   didn't feel blatantly competitive, but there was an air of healthy jealousy that is to be expected in a widely known show. However, the competition didn't cause issues in their relationship, she said, but actually made the two stronger as friends.  ""There are a lot of nuanced feelings that come with being a part of something like this,"" Isen said. ""So it's just a matter of learning how to navigate those types of intricate feelings, but we've been successful at it so far. We're still best friends.""    She also said there were many technical skills she learned from the audition. Isen said she was given more useful and applicable singing advice from the celebrity judges than she expected. She said about five to 10 minutes of each audition is cut out from the portion aired on TV, and in those cut sections there were many thought-out notes from the judges that audiences couldn't see.   [Related:    Headliners: Michael Palermo strums his way into the music industry with a ukulele   ]    Wackerman said the show could be a useful platform for up-and-coming   singers to gain exposure and learn to grow in their craft. The competition gives artists high-caliber performance experience as well, especially for those who make it far enough to perform on giant stages with a full band, she   said.  While she was able to use the skills she learned from her education on her audition day, Wackerman said she gained a new level of confidence from the audition as well. She said she struggled with believing in her own worth and capabilities as a musician, but she learned how important it is to believe in oneself when entering any kind of competition or show.  &#8220;There's something really validating in just telling yourself you can do it, and you are worthy of being in the position that you are right now,&#8221; Wackerman said.    Wackerman said someone who has been a big inspiration in her musical career is her current vocal teacher, adjunct professor Michele Weir, who   said competing in musical competitions or shows such as &#8220;American Idol&#8221;   can help artists push themselves to be the best they can be. In turn, such shows can be extremely demanding for those who make it to the final rounds, as   student competitors often face the challenge of balancing schoolwork with the show's responsibilities, Weir said.  Auditioning for the show provided her a taste of what a high-intensity musical competition was like, Wackerman said. In her future career as a musician, she said her dream is to become a recording artist and tour the world with records she writes herself.   However, she recognizes how competitive the music industry is   and holds a sense of realism over her future as well, Wackerman said.  ""Just to do the whole artist thing would be the dream,"" Wackerman said. ""But I think as long as I'm doing music in some way, shape or form in the future, I'll be happy.""

The school revised a forecast for the first time in its history after the rapid spread of the new coronavirus, now declaring that the United States has entered a recession.  The revised forecast reviewed data from the 1957-1958 H2N2 pandemic, an outbreak of an influenza virus that was first documented in Singapore, suggesting that the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic will extend through the end of September.  Because California is heavily reliant on tourism and trans-Pacific trade, the economic downturn in California will likely be slightly heavier than the rest of the nation, according to the forecast. The forecast projects that the national economy will take two years to fully recover.  William Zame, a professor of economics, said the forecast will likely be correct only if the coronavirus pandemic ends by the fall. However, many researchers are comparing the coronavirus pandemic to the Spanish flu pandemic that began in 1918 and went on for two years, Zame said.  &#8220;If the coronavirus goes on at this level, waning on and off for two years, the economy is not going to recover by 2022,&#8221; Zame said. &#8220;So I think that the Anderson forecast is probably a very reasonable forecast, under the medical assumption that the coronavirus pandemic is over this fall.&#8221;  Saki Bigio, an assistant professor of economics, said California is like any other state in this recession. However, what makes California unique is that it is home to many different types of sectors that require people to work closely together to produce something.  &#8220;Both exports and imports are collapsing, specific sectors are suffering,&#8221; he said. &#8220;(There are) demand disruptions in the sense that people cannot consume services, movies, restaurants, et cetera.&#8221;  The University of California system will likely be directly affected since it is highly dependent on California income tax revenue, which will fall, Bigio added.  Zame said universities like the UC are currently taking a large financial hit since they are largely in survival mode. While big universities will likely recover, smaller private institutions may not, he said.  &#8220;I think universities are going to be quite strange for a while. The University of California, for example, is losing millions of dollars a month,&#8221; Zame said. &#8220;And I think that lots of private universities are going to be in a lot of financial trouble, at least for a couple of years.&#8221;  The recession has become a concern for many California residents, including graduating seniors at UCLA who are worried about their future employment prospects.  Aileen Carey, a fourth-year English student, was interviewing with local entertainment companies every week before the pandemic hit. However, she is no longer able to interview and move forward in the hiring process, leaving her uncertain if she will have a job after graduation and be able to sustain herself.  &#8220;So I think it's kind of just a general feeling of uncertainty because I don't want to push them, I know the companies are suffering,&#8221; Carey said. &#8220;But I also want to finish what I started and be able to get a job, but I know that's not guaranteed.&#8221;  Noor Bouzidi, a fourth-year linguistics and anthropology student who used to be a copy editor at the Daily Bruin, is in a similar situation. Bouzidi, was planning on pursuing a career in public radio, but is uncertain if internships in San Francisco will remain.  &#8220;I'm completely anxious about whether or not I'm even going to be able to get anything once I graduate,&#8221; Bouzidi said. &#8220;I don't even know if they're even going to hold internships for the summer.&#8221;  Bigio believes the economy will be able to recover quickly if the quarantine only lasts for another couple of weeks. If the pandemic lasts for another couple of months, there is potential for entering into a very deep recession, Bigio said.  &#8220;I think the economy can survive and bounce back quickly if the quarantine lasts a month or two months,&#8221; Bigio said. &#8220;I don't think the economy can survive for months.&#8221;    ",['cap-mahnoor-ghatala'],"['california', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/50428_webop917andersonpicao.jpg

For reference, the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak that sparked a global panic in 2003 killed a total of 774 people in 29 countries worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Contol and Prevention.  It's undeniable that the entire world is facing the reverberations of the pandemic, with cases reported in at least  185 countries and territories . Italy, however, was pushed to the front of the global stage as it was one of the first countries outside of China to suffer disproportionately at the hands of the virus. What led to Italys epicenter status and how did this influence the response of other nations throughout the world?  First things first, understanding what coronavirus is and how it can develop, spread and lead to a pandemic can provide insight into Italys crisis.  As many of us know by now, COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China, and began proliferating at unprecedented rates across the globe. Typical methods for curing respiratory problems  were no match for the newfound disease , puzzling health care workers worldwide. The long incubation period undermined the new virus severity, and to top it off, the emerging symptoms coincided with flu season  making it difficult to correctly identify the seasonal sickness symptoms versus a novel strain of the coronavirus.  Interestingly, the term coronavirus is actually not exclusive to the  recently coined pandemic   a coronavirus is a type of virus that tends to originate in animals such as pigs, birds and bats and is only rarely transmitted from animals to humans. COVID-19, SARS and the 2012 outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome all fall under the coronavirus umbrella, as the latter two originated in animals and it is likely that the novel coronavirus did as well. In the case of these deadly coronaviruses,  bats  are the probable origin.  Coronavirus cases like SARS, MERS and now COVID-19 are life-threatening for a reason: As the virus jumps from animals to humans, it creates a unique hybrid called a zoonotic virus that adapts to our immune system's responses in the process. Not all zoonotic viruses become deadly threats, though  in fact, zoonotic diseases are quite common. Some other well-known zoonotic viruses include salmonella infections, rabies and Lyme disease.  COVID-19 also presents an example of a threatening illness often referred to as Disease X. According to the  World Health Organization , this phenomenon has to do with the idea that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease.  Pandemics like COVID-19 can  spread silently , and combined with the mystery shrouding a novel disease, the real severity can be downplayed and dismissed as it was in Italy.  [caption id=""attachment_378481"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""709""]    (Aris Luk/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  Caterina Caserta, a high school student from Rovigo in Veneto, Italy, one of the regions in Northern Italy most impacted by the virus, explained her view of the sentiment toward the disease when it first originated.  There was this idea that coronavirus was not as dangerous as people depicted it, Caserta said. They were saying, 'Well, its only a flu you know, dont worry about it, we cant stop the whole country.'  Federico Trudu, a third-year political science student at UCLA from Cagliari, Italy, seconded the relaxed mentality of many Italians at the beginning of the crisis.  Unfortunately, many people in other regions managed not to follow the orders to stay home, and thats how the virus spread, Trudu said in an emailed statement. Still to this day I see pictures from big cities like Milan, Naples and Rome with packed farmers markets.  At first, political leaders also promoted a sense of calm amid the brewing storm. In February, leader of the Democratic Party in Italy Nicola Zingaretti posted a photo of himself maintaining the social tradition of having an  aperitivo  as well as advocating for #MilanoNonSiFerma, or #MilanDoesntStop, according to  The Atlantic .  Caserta said that it is extreme for Western governments to take measures such as a national lockdown. This is perhaps why Western governments were slow to respond  they may not have wanted to impose restrictions on personal freedoms right away.  The implications of taking certain political measures also may have halted Italys immediate response. In an interview with  CNN , Giorgio Pal, professor of virology and microbiology at the University of Padova and former president of the European Society for Virology said that lockdown procedures were slow to start because of the debate surrounding who should be allowed within Italys borders.  ""There was a proposal to isolate people coming from the epicenter, coming from China,"" Pal said in the article. ""Then it became seen as racist, but they were people coming from the outbreak.""  Politics aside, what other factors contributed to Italys crisis?  For one, Italians are no strangers to dense, urban living  and when combined with a high infectivity rate of a disease, the environment becomes a breeding ground for transmission.  Scientists determine the infectivity of a disease using a term called R0,"" which represents the number of new cases an infected person will cause during the time they are infected. If the R0 is less than one, the disease will eventually cease to exist in a population, because the infected person will infect fewer than one person on average. Imperial College London predicted the R0 for coronavirus to be around  2.6 on average , but the value could range anywhere from 1.5 to 3.5. To compare, the R0 for the flu ranges between 2 to 3.  Likewise, the population density in Italy is relatively high. Italys population density averages 533 people per square mile, while the United States has only 94 people per square mile. Similarly, more than two-thirds of the population lives in urban areas like Milan, which contains more than 19,000 people per square mile.  Population density is not solely to blame, though  social gatherings also played a part. For example, one-third of Bergamo, Italys population attended a soccer game between Bergamos home team Atalanta BC and Spanish club Valencia CF, and more than 40,000 fans were in attendance. Scientists are citing the game as the reason why Bergamo became an epicenter of the pandemic. The game took place just days before  the first locally transmitted case of coronavirus was reported in Italy.   It didnt take long for these factors to combine and contribute to Italys status as the epicenter of the pandemic.  Unfortunately, the high number of cases has put immense strain on Italys medical force  Caserta and Trudu both said that there isnt enough personal protective equipment for doctors. Caution is key  Trudu said in an emailed statement that there are only about 250 intensive care unit beds in the entire island of Sardinia, so Italians have been careful to contain the spread.  However, Trudu said that leaders acted quickly to curb the transmission of the virus.  The major difference that I noticed about Italy  in contrast to the US  is that the Italian government acted quite promptly to shut down the country and protect its citizens, Trudu said in an emailed statement.  To curb the outbreak, Italy enforced the national lockdown further by prohibiting activities such as  walking far from home and closing parks . On Feb. 23, 11 towns were enclosed with police and military checkpoints. In addition, on Mar. 21, Italy made the momentous economic decision to shut down all production they deemed nonessential to save lives.  Thankfully, Italys situation seems to be improving. Italy recently recorded its lowest number of deaths in three weeks, and ICUs reported a decreased number of admitted patients  for the ninth day in a row .  Its important to remember Italys situation could happen anywhere  and because the U.S. is the  new epicenter of the pandemic , its more critical than ever that we look to other countries to see what worked and what didnt. Where we go from here is up to us and our governments, who have to consider what  or whos  at stake: the people close to us.  Caserta and Trudu emphasized an important takeaway after witnessing their home country at the forefront of the pandemic.  ""If the government tells us to stay home, we have to stay home, Caserta said. And we (cant) break the rules this time, because its for our health but also for the people around us and for the people that we love.

The Elections Board, which manages the Undergraduate Students Association Council election and is responsible for regulating candidate conduct, sanctioned candidates Jonathan Wisner and Christina Read for recruiting for the offices they are running for before actually winning the seats.  Wisner is running for re-election as the community service commissioner, while Christina Read is running for Student Wellness Commissioner.  Wisners and Reads misconduct are two of eight sanctions levied against candidates since campaigning for the 2020 USAC election began Wednesday. The other six charges against candidates are for premature campaigning and mistagging social media posts.  Candidates who are found to be preemptively recruiting must comply with the immediate withdrawal of staff applications, stop hiring and publish a 250-word apology posted to their campaign and personal Facebook pages, according to the sanction.The other infractions prompted the temporary suspension of online campaigning for social media violations, updating social media posts to meet the Elections Board's requirements and temporarily prohibiting campaign members found in violation from using messaging applications.  USAC President Robert Watson said that these candidates actions were not from a place of ill intent or malice.  However, Undergraduate Students Association Judicial Board Chief Justice Jamail Gibbs said that the situation with Wisner and Read was not a novel incident and that they may have followed the example of what they had previously seen. The prevalence of such actions stem from the frequent use of internal elections in commissions, Watson said.  Most UCLA students are eligible to run for USAC, but some USAC commissions hold ""internal elections"" prior to the school-wide election season where members of the commission decide who from within the office will run for the council seat. That candidate often runs unopposed in the official school-wide election said Elections Board Chair Navi Sidhu. Of the six commission seats on the council, only one is contested this year.  Read said the SWC board opts to internally elect the commissioner in order to prepare them fully before the turnover period near the end of the year when they are officially elected. Hiring staff in advance also allows the commission to train them for the upcoming year, Read added.  Wisner did not respond to requests for comment.  Gibbs said that the perception put forward by preemptive hiring and internal elections can be harmful to the student body as it can lead people to believe that elections are performative and sets a bad example for other USAC offices.  The action of hiring before the candidate ballots are released is a worrying practice as it presents the perception that the candidates won office before they knew they were running unopposed, Watson said.  The Elections Board Executive Committee released a  statement  in February condemning the practice of internal elections, stating that they pose a risk to the democratic operations of USAC. According to the statement, internal elections are a meritocratic process and lead to a misrepresentation of the students voice.  Some prospective commissioners may be concerned with the longer transition period of a normal election, which takes place around week 6, as opposed to an internal election which takes place around week 1, Watson said. Larger projects that commissions manage, such as Bruin Bash, take several months to plan.  Upwards of five commissions participate in internal elections, but it isnt widely advertised to reduce controversy, Watson said.  Gibbs said that internal elections might mean that the most qualified and experienced person running in the election is elected, bringing in a prepared individual into the position.  However, Sidhu said that the concern over internal elections has been brought to attention this year since it might impose on other prospective candidates.  The concern is that since internal elections are closed off, it discourages other students from running and the internal candidate may not be an accurate representation of the students voice, Gibbs said.  Sidhu added that the use of internal elections might indicate the need for structural change within commissions, where a shorter transition period can be accommodated with the standard election timeline.  Watson said since internal elections have been a longstanding process, a constitutional amendment should be encouraged to have it properly incorporated into the USAC constitution. This would also let the student body decide the necessity of such internal elections.  There are also larger concerns over the student perceptions of USAC due to such occurrences. Watson said that USAC is perceived as an exclusive club, and such internal elections make it more of a closed-off process.  This can create structural inequality and can discourage people from running for positions they may be passionate about, Sidhu said.",['cap-anushka-chakrabarti'],"['news', 'student-government']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/244B9E7D-F605-4BCC-B58D-A93A431075F6.jpeg

Sunday night&#8217;s ""Killing Eve"" season three premiere showcased the usual suspects struggling to bear the consequences of their actions from the ending of season two. Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw) is left in the aftermath of her lawless choices and Niko Polastri (Owen McDonnell) is grappling with the end of his marriage. Moreover, season three picks up showing the long-term aftermath from the operation in Rome.  Moving past the naivete and optimism of the earlier seasons allows the episode to stick with a strong expressionist style to reflect his newly shaken Eve (Sandra Oh). However, while beloved characters are reintroduced, their personalities can only do so much to maintain one&#8217;s interest in the show&#8217;s thinning plot. This episode is a slow start to a season meant to provide answers outside of what the characters have done since the operation in Rome.   [Related:    Alumni explore physical, psychological violence in HBO miniseries &#8216;Sharp Objects&#8217;   ]   The snail-slow pace begins with a young Villanelle (Jodie Comer) training in gymnastics right before callously murdering a young male suitor   and   pouring chalk powder over his face. While this scene is a brief glimpse into Villanelle's past, it leans into the mainstream trope of a Russian assassin school, which seems contradictory to the show's normally unpredictable plot lines. Villanelle's act of murder retains elements of her feminine touch but shifts toward less curated methods of execution, indicating a change of tone this season.   But events   suddenly jump to present-day Villanelle, chic as ever, at her own wedding reception talking only of Eve. For a moment, the plot seems to pick up the pace as Villanelle's former mentor, Dasha (Harriet Walter), starts a fight and invites her to kill for the Twelve again. But Villanelle makes her power play, demanding to be a keeper instead and planting the seeds for the long-awaited reveal of who is behind the secret organization.  Meanwhile, in England, Carolyn answers to a higher authority and struggles to maintain her power within MI6 because of her countless off-the-book decisions. Watching Carolyn lose some of her power is startlingly satisfying after so long avoiding the consequences of her actions. In these moments, the show makes it brilliantly clear who to root for as characters Carolyn and Villanelle are both selfish, and do not consider those around them,   but there's a satisfaction in seeing Carolyn reprimanded compared to the satisfaction of Villanelle avoiding them.  Once these nitty-gritty details are addressed, the episode cuts to relieve the tension of last season's cliffhanger. In classic television fashion, Eve has magically survived the bullet in Rome. She&#8217;s also separated from her husband and now works in a restaurant kitchen while unhappily sustaining herself off copious amounts of ramen and wine.   Despite the doom and gloom, the show&#8217;s familiar excellence in    world building is in full swing as a grittier, urban side of London is seen through the windows of   Eve&#8217;s dark studio apartment. Such darker tones are even reflected in Eve's self-isolation and disregard for her health. Oh's acting shines as her facial expressions and commitment to her character's hermit tendencies brings a strange sense of humor to Eve's state of resignation.   [Related:    Second Take: Minority victories at Golden Globes reflect push for greater representation in media   ]   Cutting back to Villanelle, visual cinematography pulls the episode full circle as she is seen taking the life of another victim and pouring red powder over her face. Revealed as a job for the Twelve, this kill is again out of character for the femininely flamboyant serial killer as these visceral scenes reflect a darker shift in her mental state &#8211;   mirroring Eve's mental state.  While this is a fun return of Villanelle as a hit-woman, the kill is brasher and emanates a brewing anger. It highlights a clear evolution of character as this season sets itself up to climax just as Villanelle's anger boils over. Despite the character&#8217;s shift away from past qualities, however,  Comer does an amazing job of creating consistency in Villanelle by retaining most of her classic attributes such as her humor and childlike mannerisms.  Capping the episode is Eve discovering Kenny Stowton&#8217;s (Sean Delaney) dead body outside his office building when she finally visits him. This marks a tragic end for a sweet, innocent character who helped maintain a sense of morality and positivity in Eve&#8217;s life. However, such a character sacrifice acted as a necessary plot device to motivate Eve into taking back her mantle as a quirky, serial killer-obsessed detective.  It only remains to be seen if Kenny's death will have the same effect on Eve as Frank&#8217;s did, or if she&#8217;ll take his death as an actual warning against this lifestyle. But that likely won't be the case if the series is to continue intensifying the drama of the season.  Overall, the first episode to ""Killing Eve"" season three was slow and steady, but it no doubt planted the seeds for the moments of tension to come. If the BBC show has retained anything from Phoebe Waller-Bridge's departure from the writer's room, it's the attention to details that will resurface right at the season's finale. While the plot seems to dangerously thin out, performances remain as strong as ever, and the episode does hint at more substance throughout the season as more about the Twelve is revealed.  Hopefully, Eve won't be killed along the way. ",[],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/D24E0D48-C153-44ED-908D-934BE234A7E1.jpeg

Then it was graduation.  UCLA announced Wednesday via Twitter that commencement ceremonies would be conducted online due to increasing public health concerns surrounding COVID-19.  While the decision was made to protect graduates&#8217; friends and family who may be more vulnerable to contracting the disease, the method of communication and lack of student input rubbed salt in a large &#8211; and growing &#8211; wound.   For many students, especially those first generation, transfer or undocumented students who have overcome significant obstacles to walk across the stage and receive their diploma, watching a keynote speaker address the Class of 2020 on a computer screen is no substitution for the real thing.  It is unreasonable to expect that all graduates would be able to attend a ceremony at a later date, which is why it&#8217;s important to have the option to participate virtually. But offering a traditional commencement experience when conditions become safe again would give students and families the opportunity to experience a moment they&#8217;ve waited years for.  There&#8217;s no denying that coronavirus has upended the global economy, taken thousands of lives and stands as a serious public health risk.   But to diminish the importance of commencement in a mere tweet shows UCLA cares far more about its public image than its student experience.  Other universities have made plans to postpone commencement ceremonies. University of California, Irvine, the first of the UC system to announce such a decision, said they would consider either a virtual commencement or a ceremony during winter break December 2020. Currently, all California State University commencements are postponed to later this year.  The number one public university, on the other hand, decided that it would be suitable to send off its centennial class via a screen.   Following a student petition, the University of Pennsylvania considered hosting its commencement celebrations during fall of 2020. As of the publication of this editorial, UCLA students have circulated two petitions regarding the state of commencement.  Now, the UCLA administration has given graduates the opportunity to participate in a poll on their myUCLA accounts about how they would like the commencement to take place.  All students can do now is vote for what they want their graduation experience to be and hope the university actually listens.   There&#8217;s no telling where coronavirus may take the globe even a week from now. Commencement is months away, and seeing how quickly the news cycle has evolved, it will be an equally unpredictable time. Bruins understand the logistical and public health barriers to having a graduation ceremony anytime soon &#8211; but it doesn&#8217;t mean UCLA doesn&#8217;t owe them the promise of one somewhere down the line.  &#8220;Please remember: the day does not define the journey,&#8221; UCLA&#8217;s cancellation tweet read.

Between camp and commotion, Carolyn Martens gave ""Killing Eve"" new life in this week's episode.  In ""Meetings Have Biscuits,"" Martens' character development marks the shift of the show from the seemingly untouchable actor-driven vehicle into a more sophisticated examination of the human experience. For the past two seasons, Carolyn (Fiona Shaw) was covered in a layer of dust, and finally, someone had the sense to blow it off her.   If the first two episodes of season three appeared to be crafted by a writers room tearing through the plot entrails left behind by the previous season, Sunday's episode was a proclamation of character and confidence. ""Killing Eve"" finally got a grip on a new plot  and its a good one.   [Related:    Killing Eve season 3 recap  episode 2: Management Sucks   ]   Eve (Sandra Oh) has finally made her triumphant return to her inquisitive self, investigating the death of Kenny Stowton and new activity from The Twelve  an international association of assassins. But more importantly, after two entire seasons of witty quips and only a glimpse at past relationships, Carolyn has been fully fleshed out and literally laid bare, first as she takes a meeting from her bathtub and again when getting dressed for a date.  Each time, she grows more aware of her vulnerability, a refreshing change of pace from her previous unpenetrable demeanor. Carolyn is exposed    she is no longer present just to laugh at, but rather to be a main character.  Moreover, the episode's focus on Carolyn's background provides a depth of personality while maintaining her cold temperament. In a stylistic   cut reminiscent of 1970s detective television, commentary from Villanelle, who is a psychopath, on the joyous reunion of an infant girl and her widowed father is followed shortly by a long and unflinching shot of Carolyn stiffly accepting the embrace of her daughter, Geraldine (Gemma Whelan). The transition paints Carolyn as only a slightly more empathic counterpart to Villanelle. It's the period on the end of a sentence that's been written for the first 35 minutes  Carolyn's intrapersonal relationships aren't quirky, they're dysfunctional.  Not since early on in season two has Carolyn been so scrutinized for her emotional attachments  or rather the lack thereof  and never has she been blatantly held accountable for her parental shortcomings. But even under an unflinching microscope, Carolyn is forgiven. In a triumphant harmony of smart blocking, well-paced music supervision and a meticulous series of jump-cuts, Carolyn appears to be dead for half a minute, forcing momentary reconciliation with her character flaws.  Carolyn's role as a parent is truly and fully questioned, breathing much needed fresh air into the series. Despite the familiarity of a death-by-Villanelle opening scene, this episode stands as an assertion that the style of Killing Eve has shifted to find its footing, not in the previously established murder-of-the-week formula, but with an exploration of themes driven by character study. ""Meetings Have Biscuits"" questions the role parents play in their children's lives and the answer is tactfully sought through the portrait of a stone-cold woman in mourning.   [Related:    Killing Eve season 3 recap  episode 1: Slowly Slowly Catchy Monkey   ]   While thematic and investigative at its core, theres still plenty of the trademark Killing Eve camp packed into the hour. In what can only be described as a Jane Austen novel filtered through the mind of David Fincher, the opening sequence finds Villanelle dressed casually yet carefully in an Andalusian villa, tuning a piano of all things.  Two virtuosic deaths and one crying baby later, the camera lands on Carolyn taking a bath next to her sheepish bag man Mo (Raj Bajaj). Add in a code cracked via Rubiks Cube, a monologue in a perfumery, a fake blind date and a rogue husband, and suddenly the long-awaited first kiss between Eve and Villanelle feels like merely another proceeding in the universe of Killing Eve.   This diffusion of monumental plot points and heightened emphasis on character steers the series away from a junior slump.  In sum, the episode asked the right dramatic questions and gave answers to only some of them, moving the series urgently into the next episode with unprecedented momentum. Loose ends do remain, however. The sudden appearance of Carolyn Martens daughter is still inexplicable, and why The Twelve exists at all is ultimately confusing. But amid its chaotic opulence, the essence of the show has finally   surfaced and the canvases for future episodes have a new frame on which to hang.  Even with a palpable shift in tone, the reinvigorated protagonist, the matriarch made resolute and the emotional seed planted in the impossibly empathetic psychopath made this episode quintessential Killing Eve.",['cap-annika-carlson'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/killing-eve-3.jpg

When she arrived home to Thailand on March 28, after two international flights and one domestic flight, the second-year economics student was picked up by her mother at the airport and immediately ushered into a government-mandated self-quarantine period at her home in the south of Thailand.  She set herself up in a small section of her house that included her bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen  the area where she would spend the next 14 days in almost complete isolation.  Thailand has been really strict with their quarantine measures, especially for people who are arriving from high-risk countries, Boonyamarn said. I was actually pretty lucky that I was even able to get on my domestic flight because I had just come from Japan and America.  More than 3,400 undergraduate international students attend UCLA, and some returned home after spring quarter classes moved online. Dozens of countries are imposing nationwide travel restrictions and lockdowns, with many enforcing 14-day quarantine periods for travelers returning from abroad.  A number of international students  scrambled to make decisions about flying to their home countries  with the knowledge that a two-week isolation period would begin upon their return. The perceived safety and comfort of home eventually won out for many students, and they made the long journeys back to their families.  However, some faced a long wait alone in quarantine before they could completely rejoin their families.  More than 2,000 miles away from Boonyamarns home in Thailand, Brian Wong, a first-year business economics student, and his brother entered their own self-quarantine in a Hong Kong hotel.  A few days after Wong arrived in Hong Kong on March 16, the city declared all arrivals would be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Despite avoiding the requirement, Wong and his brother, who also attends college in the United States, opted to conduct a sort of self-quarantine anyway, staying in a hotel for two weeks to avoid infecting his family and only leaving for essential items.  Christine Ow, another UCLA international student who chose to return home, began her 14-day quarantine March 23 in Singapore, she said via email. The second-year political science student arrived in Singapore before a surge in imported cases from people who had been traveling internationally and was able to serve her two-week-long quarantine at home with family, she said.  Boonyamarns first week in isolation took its toll as she adapted to quarantine. The symptoms of the disease were always in the back of her mind, and she often found that her thoughts wandered to her health while she went about her daily routine.  ""The first week is when the symptoms are the most prominent. It (was) really hard to concentrate, ... and I was really jet-lagged, Boonyamarn said. Watch lectures, take notes, and then eat, sleep. Yeah, thats about it.  Boonyamarn enrolled in four classes this quarter, and spent a lot of time during her quarantine watching lectures.  As classes moved online for the spring quarter, many international students have faced the unprecedented issue of dealing with  classes in a very different time zone.  Boonyamarn said the majority of her lectures have been recorded, but she has classes at 7 a.m. GMT+7, or 5 p.m. PST the previous day, three days a week. Most weekdays she watches lectures from 7 a.m. to noon, takes a lunch break and then works on assignments.  Its made me realize how much I appreciate in-person teaching because remote learning is really difficult, she said. I would much rather have a TA or professor explain something to me in person.  Although adjusting to this new reality has been challenging, things could be far worse, Boonyamarn said.  She said many of her professors have been very accommodating. One instructor even created a separate section for international students in different time zones, she said.  While Boonyamarn filled her waking hours with schoolwork, Wongs quarantine ended before spring quarter began. He said he felt unproductive for most of his quarantine time and would have liked the distraction of school.  I feel like, if there was schoolwork, it would have kept me kind of occupied, he said. It wouldnt make me think so much about missing my family and missing my friends.  Other forms of diversion during quarantine included a computer or mobile device.  When she wasnt watching recorded Zoom lectures, with few other options, Boonyamarn spent most of her time on screens.  At one point, I got a headache from being on the computer for too long because I was watching lectures for like four hours, and then I worked out with videos from YouTube, and then I watched Netflix after that, she said. Im on Netflix way too much because thats like the only thing you can do.  Her parents, who made the decision to quarantine themselves in a separate location from their daughter, stopped by their home each day to drop off food and supplies in a specific spot for Boonyamarn to pick up after they had left.  My parents would drop food in front of the door that separates my part of the house, and then they would give me a call to pick it up like five minutes after they leave, she said.  Health officials in her province called to check in with Boonyamarn halfway through her quarantine period, and then again on her 14th day to confirm she had experienced no symptoms.  Additionally, Thailand has been using an app to keep track of people who are self-quarantining. When Boonyamarn arrived in Thailand, she downloaded the app and filled out personal information, including recent travel details and the location of her quarantine, which was sent to her provincial health office, she said.  The most challenging part of her quarantine was the total isolation, she said.  Most of the time, she felt cut off from the world. She often felt overwhelmed when she woke up each morning to 20 to 30 emails, many from UCLA.  From the 10th day forward, it really starts to get to you mentally, she said. There are just walls everywhere, and youre always on your computer or phone because thats the only method of communication.  Boonyamarn tries to keep in touch with friends electronically, but different time zones make it difficult.  Ow said she also felt the negative effects of the physical isolation from her friends in Singapore.  She rarely gets to see them when off at college; and now, in quarantine, she still cant.  It was very frustrating and as much as I could rationalize everything I still felt wronged by the world, Ow said.  As Ow finished serving her quarantine period April 6, Singapore entered into a phase of containment called circuit breaker, similar to Californias  stay-at-home  order. This meant that citizens were discouraged from leaving their homes and many non-essential businesses were closed, she said.  Ironic that the day I was free, there was nothing to do outside, not that I was planning to go sightseeing right after, Ow said. I really wanted to just get out of the house and take a walk, so for lunch that day instead of ordering in I went out to get lunch for myself.  Wong reunited with his family and marked the end of his and his brothers self-imposed quarantine with a special family dinner.  We could eat at the same dining table for the first time since Id been home, which was kind of nice, he said. Being able to eat good food again  that was the best.  Boonyamarns isolation period officially ended Saturday at 4 p.m., but she chose to continue until the next morning to be safe. Her parents returned to their home Sunday evening.  She celebrated the long-awaited end of her quarantine by going for a drive around the local beach and treated herself to som tam, a traditional Thai papaya salad.  Ive (been) living on air conditioning and (a) laptop, so I just want to put my computer away and go for a walk anywhere, she said. Even grocery shopping, Ill take it right now.",['cap-maddie-mcdonagh'],"['a-closer-look', 'international', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/Image-from-iOS-2.jpg

More or less, thats exactly what students got.  Watsons affordability initiative  reduced  laundry fees on the hill and  allocated  $15,000 toward providing students free blue books and Scantron answer sheets. The office additionally  eliminated  bureaucratic roadblocks preventing students from receiving gender-inclusive housing.  On the accessibility side, Watson spearheaded a student government leadership conference attended by student leaders from a dozen universities. He also established a search committee to ensure cross-campus and minority student representation presented in presidential appointees.  But lets not forget his work in the fall special election. About 9% of students turned out to vote, despite the offices SuccYOUlents Vote initiative touted by Watson.  No doubt, Watson accomplished a great deal in his term as president. But USAC engagement reached an all-time low. To be fair, Watson fought an uphill battle. Three USAC council positions were left unfilled coming into his presidency  a sad marker of the campus engagement with student government. However, it seems as though he snipped any last threads of faith in governance with sloppy messaging and questionable conduct displayed by members of his council throughout the end of winter quarter and into this years election season.  Like it or not, the trust deficit falls on the presidents shoulders. After all, they serve as the head of council and the face of student government.  Watson can check off all the completed campaign promises. But trust is where he fails.  Students need more empathetic leadership and less haughty personalities. They need leaders who meet them where they are.  And thats not a class of 2020 GroupMe.  The board believes Watson entered office with quality platforms. And theres no doubt of his offices efficacy.  However, the concerns lie with Watsons level of transparency and engagement. Instead of repairing a broken relationship with students, Watson proved his inability to connect with a larger student body often untouched by USACs outreach efforts. Whats more, Watson was perhaps too transparent. Sharing screenshots of correspondence from UCLA officials is irresponsible, both to the sender and the receivers. This mixed-messaging does not help any student looking to find solace in uncertainty.  Its unfortunate Watsons presidency tumbled in its last couple of weeks.

COVID-19 has drastically changed the educational experience of UCLA students with clubs, jobs, office hours and lectures now compressed into the flat universe of the computer screen. The transition to online classes at UCLA due to  safer-at-home orders  has raised concerns about the cost of tuition, particularly for out-of-state and international students whose tuition and fees amount to over $15,000 for spring quarter alone compared to the in-state price of around $5,350. Given these changes, should they still be expected to pay the full price of tuition?  Valerie Fletcher, a third-year political science student and an out-of-state student, expressed frustration with the amount she is paying given the compromised quality of her education and experience under the current circumstances.  I think its outrageous that theyre still making us pay $15,000 a quarter for classes that are honestly horrible,"" Fletcher said. ""Zoom freezes, people arent muted, people are laughing  its super distracting. $15,000 for an online education feels like Im getting robbed.  UCLA has stated that campus tuition and fees will not change during online instruction despite students lack of access to some on-campus activities and resources. UC spokesperson Sarah McBride said in an email statement that these fees are needed to cover the costs of delivering instruction online and providing remote students services such as registration, financial aid and academic advising.  However, some students like Fletcher question the continuation of these fees given their lack of access to many of the campus resources that they originally signed up to pay for.  ""Theres no reason why we shouldnt get that fee back since none of us are on campus, Fletcher said.  Yanqin Li, a second-year psychology student and an international student   from China, also expressed disappointment regarding the opportunities she is missing due to the current situation.  Im not currently in any clubs, and I was thinking maybe I should check out this consulting club or this writing club,"" she said. ""I also wanted to do individual study with one of the faculty here on campus. Now I cannot check out clubs anymore, and as for the individual studies, Ill have to talk to faculty via email, which will be a little awkward and inconvenient.  As students express concern over these lost opportunities, the current situation has also created difficulties for the University of California, which currently faces increased costs due to COVID-19 from both unexpected expenses and lost revenue.  In a letter sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom on April   15, UC president   Janet Napolitano stated that unanticipated costs totaled $558 million for March alone.  In addition, the UC chancellors and Napolitano announced April 2 that there would be no layoffs for career employees through the remainder of the fiscal year. Napolitano also issued a statement in March announcing that all UC employees would be eligible for 128 hours of paid administrative leave to be used before the end of December 2020.  Given these financial difficulties, Li expressed doubts as to whether it would be reasonable to ask the UC for tuition cuts considering the University still has to pay professors and staff.  UC has also lost millions in housing and dining revenue as students have left campuses, though some dormitories have remained open for students. In addition, students returning from canceled study abroad and Washington, D.C., programs were provided housing to quarantine for 14 days.  Li, who still lives on the Hill, received an email from student housing on April 13 announcing that she would be moving into a new room to consolidate remaining residents. The email also said that students would be placed one to a room with either a private or shared bathroom in an effort to promote social distancing. Students will be billed the Classic Triple rate regardless of the room type they are assigned.  Despite the stress of housing adjustments, Li said she felt supported by the UC.  I think its pretty considerate that theyre placing us into rooms with shared or private bathrooms and we dont have to pay anything extra, she said.  Fortunately, institutions of higher education in the U.S. are not being stranded in this financial predicament.     The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law by   President Trump   late March, will provide nearly $14 billion to institutions of higher education to help pay for unforeseen costs related to COVID-19.  The funds will be distributed to institutions through the student financial aid system with about half the amount allocated for emergency aid to students. According to a letter issued by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on April 9, each institution will be responsible for developing their own system to determine how to distribute these funds to students.  An estimated $130 million will be allocated to the UC from the CARES Act for direct aid to students, including to those previously ineligible for assistance because of higher family incomes. The UC plans to recalculate financial aid to reflect students current needs.  According to UCLA's Financial Aid and Scholarships Office,    UCLA specifically is expecting to receive $35,906,870 through the CARES Act, of which at least $17,953,435 will be used for direct student aid. UCLA has assembled a task force to determine how these funds will be used and hopes to begin making disbursements to students in the next 30 days.  However, the $260 million that the UC system is allotted to receive through the CARES Act isnt enough to even cover the first month of costs that the UC incurred due to the pandemic.  On the other hand, if the UC doesnt adequately support its students, there may be an increase in leave of absences and withdraws as students choose to save money rather than take classes online.     The American Council on Education predicts that enrollment for the 2020-2021 academic year will drop by about 15%, with a 25% percent decline in the number of international students. This decline would result in a further decrease of revenue for the UC.  Despite the transition to online instruction, McBride said that top quality instructors continue to deliver classes, and the value of the University's educational experience and degree remains.  However, many of the values of attending a UC come from outside the classroom. In particular, Fletcher voiced concern about missing out on the social aspect of life at UCLA.  ""The whole point of college is to meet people, network and use those connections later to get a job,"" she said.  Fletcher said that she would consider the option of withdrawing her enrollment in the fall if safer-at-home mandates were to continue.  Ill take my summer classes because it is cheaper as an out-of-state student. Besides that, I have enough credits to withhold my admission until things get back to normal.  Time will only tell what the new ""normal"" will look like and whether or not out-state-students will see a change in their tuition rates. Until then, Bruins around the world and across the country will continue fumbling with Zoom audio as they wonder   if online classes are worth the price.",['cap-maya-harris'],"['academics', 'student-life', 'quad', 'westwood-quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.quad_.outofstatetuition.KL_.jpg

A video surfaced on Twitter on Thursday showing UCPD officers approaching a black man on Kelton Avenue with a stun gun. The one-minute video ended with the sound of a stun gun being activated.  UCPD spokesperson Scott Scheffler said officers approached the individual because of several reports of criminal threats and assault against a student and staff member, but they did not harm him in the encounter.  The officers approached the man because he matched the descriptions provided by the victims, Scheffler said in a subsequent emailed statement.  The noise in the video was a warning to the suspect, who then complied, and no probes or cartridges were deployed, he said.  UCPD  declined  to provide the Daily Bruin with arrest records or dashcam footage because the incident is still under an active investigation with pending criminal charges.  UCPD  is still i n the process of implementing body cameras for patrol officers  and does not have body camera footage of the incident , Scheffler added.  UCPD planned to  implement body cameras  for officers by 2016. In 2017, a UC spokesperson told The Bruin the UC was  finalizing  UC body camera policy.  The man was booked for felony assault with a deadly weapon, criminal threats, battery and providing false information to a peace officer, according to a UCPD daily log.  The video, which has since been deleted, came in light of increased tensions following the death of George Floyd, who was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, by a police officer Monday. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday to protest Floyds death.   [Related link:    Protests erupt in Los Angeles in response to death of George Floyd   ]   Philip Germain, the fourth-year political science student who filmed the video, said he was at his residence on Kelton Avenue when he heard shouting outside.  Based on what happened and what continues to happen with police, I wanted to see what was going on, Germain said.  Germain said the man begged with police officers, telling them not to shoot because he was trying to cooperate. The man told police he did not want to get on the ground because he had not done anything wrong, Germain said.  At this point, Germain said he heard a Taser go off. Germain said he was unsure whether the man was hit with the stun gun, but said the victim flinched and twisted around very quickly in response to the sound.  The man was stripped of his belongings and taken into custody after the encounter, Germain said.  Germain added that the country has had problems with aggressive force by the police against people of color, and he wanted to make sure the incident was documented.  Based on the trends, ...

Academic student employees, or ASEs, who are part of the United Auto Workers Local 2865 union said they are going to vote in early April on whether to hold an unfair labor practice strike that would be backed by the union. Strike organizers said they have gathered approximately 3,000 signatures from graduate students throughout the UC system pledging to participate in a ULP strike.  Such a strike would aim to pressure the University of California into reinstating dozens of graduate students who were fired for striking at UC Santa Cruz in early March. It would also push the UC to negotiate directly with the union over cost-of-living issues.  However, hundreds of graduate students have said they intend to strike regardless of whether they are backed by the union. Many of these students are part of an organization called Ucla4Cola, which has previously protested the firing of UCSC student workers and what they perceive as unfair working conditions for ASEs in the UC system.  Ucla4Cola students  voted to go on a strike  not backed by UAW 2865 in early March pending the approval of 10 academic departments. However, student organizers ultimately decided to delay the demonstrations after UCLA closed due to concerns over the novel coronavirus, said UCLA graduate student and protest organizer Sucharita Kanjilal in an emailed statement.  Chief among the demands of Ucla4Cola is that UCLA implement a cost-of-living-adjustment, also known as COLA for ASEs so that graduate students can afford to live locally. Los Angeles is one of the U.S.'s most expensive cities, and Westwood specifically was  recently ranked  as being in the fourth-most pricey zip code for renters in the country.  Labor activism planned by both the COLA activists and the union leadership has been largely overshadowed recently by the outbreak of the coronavirus. As a result of the pandemic, UCLAs administration  announced earlier this month  that classes during the spring quarter would be taught remotely.  Michael Dean, a UCLA representative of UAW 2865, said despite the events surrounding the outbreak, union leadership is still planning on voting in the first week of April on whether to conduct a strike across UC campuses.  He also said the legal restrictions implemented since the pandemic began,  such as Gov. Gavin Newsoms ban on large gatherings , would likely inhibit some aspects of a labor demonstration.  Itll be impossible for us to organize the kinds of rallies weve seen on other types of campuses, he said. Itll be impossible to organize a picket line with which to dramatize our actions.  Zak Fisher, UCLA Graduate Students Association president and a leader of the Ucla4Cola movement, said that far from inhibiting efforts to organize a strike, remote instruction could have the opposite effect by insulating ASEs from university retaliation.  I think that the COLA movement will really thrive online. ... Theres tremendous momentum online for a new movement like this, he said. It could make it easier to strike; the idea that they can punish you for not working from home during a global pandemic is ridiculous.  Fisher and others are planning to launch a wildcat strike, or a labor demonstration outside of the union framework and not covered under an official labor contract, similar to the strike that took place at UCSC. UCSCs administration swiftly cracked down on these student protests,  firing 74 graduate student teaching assistants  who refused to turn in grades as part of the strike.  Fisher added that the COLA movements goals go beyond the scope of the ULP strike being organized by the labor union, which he said would largely benefit union members who only comprise a minority of UCLAs graduate student workers.  Theres no guarantee that theres a COLA at the end of that negotiation, Fisher said, referring to potential labor negotiations between the union and the university after the strike.  Fisher also criticized the goals of the union as falling short of addressing the most crucial needs of student workers.  The goal of a ULP (strike) is to resolve unfair labor practices but not to bring about a COLA specifically, Fisher said. Theyre trying to pull a fast one on their members. In the best case scenario this brings us back to the status quo.  Participants in union-sanctioned strikes enjoy protections under California law that they would not receive under a wildcat strike, Dean said.  In the context of a union authorized strike, the university cant fire workers who participate, Dean said. They cant discipline workers for participating in strike activity because its a strike protected by California law. The workers in a wildcat strike are at considerably greater risk than if they were to participate in a union authorized strike because we have a right to strike.  Both COLA activists and UAW labor members expressed concern over how the university might respond to a strike, particularly in relation to international students who may participate in the strike.  At UCSC, the legal status of many international students who participated in the wildcat strike was threatened after some lost their teaching assistant jobs and subsequently risked losing their visas.  Michael Stenovec, a UCLA graduate student studying political science, said he believes that UCLAs administration could likely threaten the status of striking graduate students using tactics similar to those employed by UCSC officials.  I cant imagine (UCLAs administration) behaving differently here, he said.  Fisher said that international students participating in any kind of labor protest would have to take the prospect of university retaliation into account, but added that this dynamic underscored the importance of securing more equitable working conditions for ASEs.  International students should take these considerations seriously, he said. They often take the brunt of this situation and they have the greatest need for a COLA, which is why we have a lot of international students involved in our movement.",['cap-stephen-wyer'],"['campus', 'news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/32ef93a7-1f77-406a-b22b-0798ec1c76fd.jpg

One day we, could have tacos; the next day, we&#8217;ll have tortas or pambazos. We tend to keep people on their toes.&#8221;  After working at Rendezvous for 10 years, Huerta said she decided to take a different route to fulfill her culinary dreams by teaming up with Garcia, whom she had met through Instagram. Garcia originally started Evil Cooks as a T-shirt ""company for cooks &#8211; punk and metal bands&#8217; influences on the brand&#8217;s designs caught Huerta's attention online, she said. The two bonded over a shared love of death metal and cooking, Garcia said, and Huerta eventually began to assist him with various catering gigs while she was still working at Rendezvous.""   [Related:    Restaurant review: Tacos 1986 spices up Westwood food scene with vibrant, authentic Mexican flavors   ]   When the demand for catering increased, Huerta and Garcia began to seriously consider opening a pop-up restaurant, leading to the rebranding of Evil Cooks as a taqueria, he said.   Similar to its origin, many of Evil Cooks&#8217; dishes are spontaneously created, as the restaurant does not have a set menu. Rather, Huerta and Garcia spend their trips to the farmers market examining ingredients and choosing whichever ones they find appealing in the moment. The pair can create a menu in less than an hour, and all the items are inspired by what Huerta and Garcia grew up eating, Garcia said. Their popular taco de fideo originated from Huerta&#8217;s memories as a young girl eating sopa de fideo &#8211; a brothy tomato soup &#8211; as an after-school ""snack. By drawing upon these fond memories, Garcia said they hope to evoke a sense of nostalgia in their customers.""  &#8220;Most of our items in our menu are childhood memories,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;When (Huerta) proposed to do the fideo taco, that was something that I was raised on in Mexico, eating leftover fideo ... everything (on our menu) is something (related) to our childhood. We want to play with a sense of memory.&#8221;  Using these childhood memories as a starting point, Huerta and Garcia said they modify them and experiment in the kitchen to add their own twist. A signature dish that Huerta conceived is the restaurant&#8217;s flan taco, known as La Bruja, which was a product of her tinkering in the kitchen. Though tacos are traditionally savory, Huerta said both she and Garcia thought that a taco could have any flavor &#8211; including sweet. This staple taco is made of a crepe-like tortilla hybrid that Huerta concocted, which is then filled with a piece of flan, sprinkled with coconut and polvorones, then finally garnished with mint and an orange peel.    [Related:    A look into the appeal of pop-up restaurants in LA, how they find success   ]   Evil Cooks&#8217; success can also be attributed to Huerta&#8217;s ability to focus on the task at hand and the playful menu, said Jacob Guzman, who occasionally helps out with the pop-up. Their tacos al pastor, which are a staple of Mexican cuisine, feature a black tortilla created through the use of dark spices, matching Evil Cooks&#8217; punk and metal theme, Guzman said. While other taquerias may also serve tacos al pastor or other Mexican staples, he said Evil Cooks&#8217; power to make its menu items unique to its brand is a product of Huerta&#8217;s creativity and drive.""  Despite their newfound success, Huerta said she still experiences injustices as a woman in the taqueria business, which is  traditionally a male-dominated industry . Garcia and Huerta both run Evil Cooks, but she said many people assume that Garcia is in charge of the restaurant and Huerta is merely an assistant.    &#8220;You see a lot of guys running taquerias, but you don&#8217;t see a lot of women out there being recognized for their work,&#8221; Huerta said. &#8220;A lot of people always give (Garcia) acknowledgment, give him credit, when it&#8217;s both of us. It doesn&#8217;t really bother me, but it is kind of discouraging when they don&#8217;t recognize me as a woman, having to run a business.""  But within a year, Huerta said they have come a long way. Evil Cooks was invited to the annual Taco Libre festival in Dallas in April, which she said signifies their expanding reach from within Los Angeles to crossing state lines over 1,000 miles away. Huerta said the pop-up  has granted her the opportunity to travel throughout Los Angeles and Mexico and meet new people. However, she said Evil Cooks&#8217; ultimate goal is to open a shop or restaurant in a permanent location rather than continue to hop around the city.  &#8220;We hope to have our own brick and mortar,&#8221; Huerta said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to rush anything yet because we want to build a foundation first &#8211; build a following, make sure people know us. ... So, we&#8217;re just taking our time. Slowly, but one day.&#8221; ",[],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ae_.evilcooks.courtesy.jpg

But, with all this present-day scrutiny considered, the question then becomes: what exactly is it?  In the wake of several recent and   highly-publicized incidences of police brutality against Black Americans, there has been a resurgence of discussions regarding whether or not qualified immunity   should be discontinued  . Today, The Quad aims to dissect these calls for reform and bring more clarity to the complexities of this doctrine   that has been used in many   civil rights and police brutality   cases.  Qualified immunity is a judicial doctrine that affords protection for government officials, including police officers,   in cases where they are alleged to have violated a civilian's constitutional rights.   Specifically, the protection allows for cases against officers to be dismissed if courts have not clearly established the allegedly violated right as guaranteed by the Constitution.  Joanna Schwartz, a UCLA law professor whose research was cited in a recent  federal court decision  on the subject, explained that there are very specific requirements, like the ""clear establishment"" of a constitutional right, that must be met to override qualified immunity protections.  According to Schwartz, to meet the ""clearly established"" requirement, there needs to be a prior case with almost identical facts to the case in question in which   a court deemed the actions of an officer to be unconstitutional. Otherwise, Schwartz said, a case may be dismissed. This creates a loop: qualified immunity terminates a lawsuit because there is no similar case on the books, but there is no similar case on the books because the lawsuits are continually blocked.  Aaron Littman, a UCLA law professor and police accountability specialist, said if a civilian fled and was shot in the leg by a police officer, the civilian   would need to find another case that clearly established   the officers actions as unconstitutional.  You might think thats not so hard to do because there are lots of cases about people getting shot by police officers, Littman said. But what the courts have said is that you need to find a case thats very precisely on point.  Additionally, Littman explained that when qualified immunity   was first established, the Supreme Court defined two steps to implement the doctrine. First, a court must check whether the alleged treatment by police violated&nbsp;a constitutional right. Second, the court must determine if that right was clearly established. However, the process has changed since its initial establishment and courts can now choose to rule only on whether the allegedly violated right is clearly established.  If courts were forced to determine whether an officer's actions were unconstitutional, this could set precedents that could override qualified immunity in the future, Littman said. But because courts are no longer required to determine whether such allegations are violations of constitutional rights, Littman added, plaintiffs have a much more difficult time bringing cases successfully past the barrier of qualified immunity due to a lack of new precedents.  On top of this, Schwartz said that plaintiffs often face hurdles proving constitutional violations because of the Supreme Courts tendency to defer to the expertise of cops in criminal matters and civil rights cases.  The court has claimed that officers wont have violated the Constitution if they acted reasonably,"" Schwartz said. ""Even if they acted in error, the Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that police officers, for example, are often making split-second decisions, and so shouldnt be punished if they make mistakes.  According to the Cato Institute, a public policy research organization, those in favor of retaining qualified immunity argue that officers should not have to think about abstract constitutional rights when making split-second decisions. Removing qualified immunity   might make officers hesitate during critical   moments.  But Littman said that it is the degree of this leniency that has become an issue.  The problem is weve gone far, far beyond a little bit of leeway, Littman said. Its one thing to say you cant hold a police officer to the same standard as someone in retrospect because theyre acting in the heat of the moment. Its another thing to say because there wasnt a court case that clearly held that when a person is sitting up rather than lying down, you cant sic a dog on them, the officer cant be liable.  Even if plaintiffs make it past the hurdles of clear establishment, Schwartz said juries and judges in many parts of the U.S. hold   biases toward cops and against many of the plaintiffs, who tend to be people of color and/or have prior criminal records.  Among these barriers, both Schwartz and Littman said citizens and officials from all parts of the ideological spectrum   have voiced their concerns about qualified immunity and have advocated for its dismantling. Nonetheless, the origin of the doctrine makes its potential removal more challenging than meets the eye.         Section 1983   of Title 42 of the United States Code, initially a part of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, allows citizens to bring accusations of civil rights violations at the hands of local and state officials to federal court. However, the Supreme Court has used the doctrine of qualified immunity in cases brought pursuant to Section 1983 to protect government officials, Littman said.  The Supreme Court has historically argued that qualified immunity helps balance police accountability against the interests of shielding officers from the burdens of constantly coming to court, Schwartz said. Proponents of qualified immunity additionally claim the removal of qualified immunity could have judges and juries examining split-second decisions and   reaching verdicts that incur large costs for cities and public officials.  But, despite the Supreme Courts use of the statute to justify claims of qualified immunity, Justice Clarence Thomas expressed concerns about using Section 1983 to justify the usage of qualified immunity   in a  dissenting opinion  Monday.  Over the course of thousands of decisions, the Supreme Court established the doctrine of qualified immunity, which in and of itself is not a law Congress explicitly voted into effect. As a result, eliminating qualified immunity is more complicated than simply striking out a line or two from the U.S. Code, Littman said.  A bill to repeal (the doctrine) would have to affirmatively say that this is not an immunity that applies or not a defense that exists, Littman said.  Additionally, Schwartz said even if qualified immunity were to be repealed, the justice system would not radically change.  I dont think ending qualified immunity is some silver bullet and afterward civil rights litigations would look dramatically different, Schwartz said. There are still going to be many barriers . ""  Lawmakers such as South Carolina Senator Tim Scott have argued there are other methods of holding officers accountable aside from revisiting or nullifying qualified immunity.  Even so, Schwartz stated that ending qualified immunity would shift the focus in civil rights cases away from precedents and instead toward the violations at hand, while also reducing the cost and time currently needed in these civil rights litigations.     Briefing and arguing about qualified immunity takes time and expertise, so I think it would reduce some of the barriers to entry for lawyers who are interested in taking civil rights cases, Schwartz said.  Schwartz believes the Supreme Court and lower courts currently send a message to officers that their violations of citizens constitutional rights will go unpunished. Similarly, these courts give citizens the impression that their rights can be violated with impunity, and ending qualified immunity would terminate these messages, Schwartz added.  All of this considered, the next thing to ask is: where does all of this stand today?  The Supreme Court decided June 16 that it would not review the qualified immunity doctrine despite numerous appeals to do so. Thus, it looks like changes  if they are going to come any time soon  will come from a different branch of government than the one responsible for the doctrine's prominence.  As a result, though the future of qualified immunity remains uncertain, the movement towards confronting police misconduct is far from over. In the meantime, having a solid understanding of the doctrine and its origins will help Bruins to understand and to take a stand in the debates that will inevitably continue to unfold around it.",['cap-maanas-oruganti'],['quad'],https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/quadqualifiedimmunity-1024x780.png

During Tuesdays LA County Board of Supervisors meeting, Ferrer said stay-at-home orders will be extended until July. Certain businesses may begin to reopen if social distancing guidelines can safely be enforced.    LAs stay-at-home orders were supposed to last until May 15   after previously being extended on April 10. This is the second time the orders, which were first issued March 19, will be extended.    Under stay-at-home orders, people must stay at home whenever possible, with the exception of working or shopping at a place of essential business.    On May 4, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the state would begin slowly reopening. Many of Californias hiking trails, parks and other nonessential businesses were reopened to the public Friday and Saturday.    LA County beaches are planned to open Wednesday, although face coverings will be required, and some restaurants and shopping malls are also preparing to reopen in the coming weeks. However, Ferrer said any further loosening of social distancing protocols will be slow and tightly regulated, reported the    Los Angeles Times   .    Despite these steps forward, LA County has continued to see a rise in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths.    The LACDPH reported Tuesday an additional    961    people have tested positive for the virus, and the    death toll    now exceeds 1,600.     Stay-at-home orders will only be eased when a county can prove it has met Newsoms   readiness criteria  . Social distancing requirements will likely remain in place until more effective tools for testing and treatment are developed, Ferrer said.

Napolitano recommended that the UC make the SAT and ACT test requirement optional for admissions through the 2022 admissions cycle and fully drop standardized tests from the admissions process through 2024.    During this time, the UC would develop a new test that better aligns with the UCs values that would be available to students at California high schools   during the 2025 admissions cycle, according to Napolitanos recommendation.    Even if the new test is not ready by 2025, the UC would not resume the use of the ACT or SAT in its admissions process for California students, if the recommendation is followed.    However, it is unclear whether the new test will be available to out-of-state and international students. In the proposal, Napolitano recommended that the UC Academic Senate work with the administration to develop an approach for these students starting in 2025.    Students would still be able to use ACT and SAT scores for scholarship consideration, admissions guarantees and course placement through 2024  .    The University of California Board of Regents is set to vote on the matter May 21 at its upcoming   meeting.    The UC    announced    in April that it would not require students applying for fall quarter to submit SAT or ACT scores due to the coronavirus pandemic.    The recommendation contradicts a vote by the UC Academic Senate in April, which passed 51-0 with one abstention, in support of the UCs continued use of standardized tests in the application process while other options are examined.    The UC was    sued    in December by high school students, admissions equity organizations and a Los Angeles school district for its use of standardized testing in admissions.    The groups claimed that the use of the SAT and ACT in the admissions process discriminates against underrepresented minority students and requested that the UC discontinue its use of standardized testing.

The third-year biochemistry and economics student is one of many UC students whose study abroad programs in China, South Korea and Italy have been suspended, following the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus.  &#8220;It's not exactly easy to be able to just go and study abroad because there are not really that many options (for my majors),&#8221; Pham said. &#8220;And so I had been planning to study abroad for quite a long time.&#8221;  COVID-19 first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread to over 80 countries, including South Korea, Italy and the United States, prompting travel bans, screenings and widespread emergency response.  More recently, COVID-19 spread to California, with 11 confirmed cases in Los Angeles and one death in the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over the disease Wednesday. Los Angeles County also declared a local state of emergency Wednesday.  UCLA announced a ban on all official university travel to mainland China, South Korea, Italy and Iran, which have all reached a Level 3 &#8220;Reconsider Travel&#8221; Warning by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an emailed statement sent Thursday to students. The email also discouraged all nonessential travel, especially to places with Level 3 travel warnings.  UCLA&#8217;s announcement follows the UC&#8217;s suspension of all nonessential travel to China, according to a letter sent by UC president Janet Napolitano to UC chancellors in January.   &#8220;The health and safety of our UC community is our No. 1 priority,&#8221; Napolitano wrote. &#8220;To that end, following both CDC and State Department guidance, I am directing the UC community to temporarily avoid all nonessential travel to China, while it is designated with a Warning Level 3 Travel Notice.&#8221;  The UC Education Abroad Program suspended spring study abroad programs in China on Jan. 27, South Korea on Feb. 26 and Italy on Feb. 28, said Myla Edmond, a UCEAP representative.  Summer programs in mainland China also have been suspended. However, no fall programs have been canceled at this point.  The suspension of travel has affected many students who had been planning on completing these programs in the spring, Edmond said. She added that the UCEAP must follow UC policy to suspend programs that reach a Level 3 travel advisory.  &#8220;We abide by UC policy: Any location that the Department of State and the CDC elevate the travel advisory to a Level 3 or greater, we are required to suspend those programs and so once the level has been elevated to a Level 3, it's not even a question of, 'Should we?'&#8221; Edmond said. &#8220;We have to.&#8221;  UCEAP has attempted to maintain communication with students and within the office about COVID-19, Edmond said.  However, Pham said she wishes the UC had been more clear about the information. She said even after the US issued its travel warning and South Korea had been at a Level 2 travel advisory warning, students were not told that the program might be canceled.  &#8220;I think at least in terms of student welfare, (the UC) could have at least announced that those were going to be possibilities,&#8221; Pham said. &#8220;And then, at least when we got the email, it was unclear on what the options were at the moment. ... It would have been definitely less stressful if they had just told us, 'These are your options,' immediately.&#8221;  Pham was given the option to take a leave of absence and return back to UCLA or to stay in Seoul. She decided to stay in South Korea and enroll at Yonsei University as an exchange student.  Pham said her semester in Yonsei has been delayed by two weeks because of COVID-19, and she will take the first two weeks of class online.  She added that she receives emailed updates from Yonsei on COVID-19, and is well-informed from Korean media on what to do in case she contracts the disease.  &#8220;They seem to be handling the situation quite well,&#8221; Pham said. &#8220;I know exactly what numbers I would need to call if I suspected that I had coronavirus. I know where I could go to get tested or where I would go for treatment. ... There's constant dissemination of information.&#8221;  South Korea has dealt with the outbreak through pop-ups on major websites, hand sanitizers in many major areas and discouragement of holding or attending large gatherings, Pham said.  &#8220;For the most part, I don't think there's rampant fear; at least, I&#8217;m not feeling fear,&#8221; Pham said. &#8220;I'm definitely feeling like there's a lot of caution and people are definitely more careful.

However, at around 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, Garcetti announced in a tweet that the California National Guard was being deployed to LA.   Several students confirmed seeing National Guard troops walking around Westwood near the intersection of Strathmore Drive and Levering Avenue around 8 p.m. on Sunday.   Protests in LA started Friday in Downtown LA and have resulted in more than 500 arrests   by   early Saturday. Garcetti issued a curfew for the city of Los Angeles on Saturday starting at 8 p.m. that will last until 5:30 a.m. on Sunday.

But of the four classes second-year Arsh Gupta is taking, he is only able to change the grading scale to pass/no pass for one.  One of Guptas majors, applied mathematics, is among the roughly 16% of majors within the College of Letters and Science that have not allowed their students to apply pass/no pass grading for major-required courses, according to Jeffrey Lewis, chair of the faculty for the college.  When departments change their grading policies, they are recommended to submit a memo to the faculty executive committee, Lewis said. Only three departments, mathematics, economics and physics and astronomy, have not reached out to the faculty executive committee, Lewis said.  Lewis said the departments within each school have the freedom to design the programs they feel are best for their students, but added it takes time within the various schools at UCLA and departments within each school to change their grading policies.  Several students said they are impacted by the departments who have not applied pass/no pass grading policy for their major requirements.  Manasa Lakshmi, a first-year astrophysics student, dealt with anxiety and other mental health issues prior to the pandemic. Recently, somebody close to her family tested positive for the coronavirus.  Lakshmi said she learns best from face-to-face interactions and remote learning makes it difficult to achieve her greatest potential.  The optional pass/no pass grading policy at UCLA has alleviated stress for some students, but hasnt helped others, including herself, she said.  I wish that they listened to the students, as there are several of us worried about our grades in three or four classes that do not allow for the pass/no pass grading scheme, Lakshmi said.  The physics and astronomy department has allowed for pass/no pass grading for major courses, but only if students submit a petition, according to a statement on the policy decided by the departments academic affairs committee. The statement cited many students confidence in their abilities to earn high grades or preference for letter grades because of their career plans.  Albert Courey, a biochemistry professor, believes the new grading policy for this quarter will ease some of the burdens felt by students as they adjust to online learning.  I think all of our students are feeling stress having to negotiate the sudden switch to distance learning, Courey said. In addition to that, of course, (are) their concerns about the well-being of their family and friends who may be affected. ... We just thought by giving them this additional option, it would (be) some small way towards relieving stress.  Although some departments have not changed their policies yet, there are many that are still considering the option, said Leigh Harris, director of curricular initiatives for the undergraduate education division.  It takes time within the various schools at UCLA and departments within each school to change their grading policies, Lewis said.  Faculty within each department are actually voting to accept pass/no pass to satisfy major and minor requirements, Harris said. So what is taking time (is) faculty are being thoughtful.  As the quarter continues, decisions are still being made regarding how students are learning via online education, Harris said.  The campus is engaging in various efforts to try to understand the student experience right now so that we can refine and enhance the mode of instruction over the summer and in the fall, Harris said. Particularly if it turns out we are remote or hybrid.  Gupta said he wishes some of these decisions would come faster in order to relieve the anxiety many students face during this pandemic.  Everyone has really been vocal about how theyve been feeling and I definitely commend the people whove shown the courage to come up and speak about their experiences, he said. But, at the same time, its so disheartening to see that it doesnt really materialize to any tangible change.","['cap-anushka-chakrabarti', 'cap-brittney-le']","['a-closer-look', 'academics-news', 'campus']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ns_.pnp_.file_.jpg

Inspired by the French play ""Cyrano de Bergerac,"" Alice Wu wrote and directed the 2020 Netflix film, transposing the classic tale into the small fictional town of Squahamish. Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis) is a closeted, straight-A student whose difficult financial situation forced her to help a jock, Paul Munsky (Daniel Diemer), pen a love letter to woo the girl she is also secretly in love with, Aster Flores (Alexxis Lemire). What begins as a benign transaction soon snowballs into a precarious facade that is at times emotionally taxing to watch, but ends in a sensibly optimistic pay-off for the trio.   [Related:    Movie review: Tigertail offers intimate look into family relationships across generations   ]   The film begins with a pointed spoiler in Chu's narration where she claims the film ""is not a love story, or not one where anyone gets what they want. As the narrative unfolds, however, it becomes clear that love does drive the story  not in the conventional heteronormative sense  but in its myriad forms that span across gender and sexuality. While the storyline could have easily morphed into another one of Netflixs shallow teenage rom-coms, it is redeemed through emotionally distinct characterizations and an ending that takes into account the reality of the situation instead of forcing a picture-perfect ideal.  The story's emotional linchpin lies in the slow-building friendship between Lewis' and Diemer's characters. The actors naturally bounce off of each other's energy in moments of comedic buffoonery and heartbreaking confrontations. Their on-screen chemistry helps bring the script to life especially as the two banter their way through taco sausages which may just become the next must-try quarantine combo.  Aside from the film's quirky new foods, it also features characters who are able to defy cliches. Paul especially seems to check off all the stereotypes of a jock on paper: slow-witted, awkward and simple-minded. But the film creates additional dimensions through expressive dialogues and personable traits, like the heavy use of emojis in his texts. Diemers performance masterfully embodies his characters easy-going and brazen-faced personality and rounds it out with subtle emotional vulnerabilities.  Lewis also delivers a dynamic performance in a stereotypical role with added twists, convincingly projecting the no-nonsense attitude in the physicality of her character and complementing it with a dose of naivety. Ellie gets good grades, plays the piano for church and is equally responsible and resourceful. But her closeted sexuality  not commonly seen in Asian representations in the media  places her at moral odds with both the townspeople and her own family.   [Related:    Movie review: Despite its detailed animation, The Willoughbys delivers an uninspiring comedy   ]   To make matters worse, Ellie is also faced with the dilemma of choosing a college that either allows her to stay and take care of her immigrant father (Collin Chou) or forces her to leave her family behind in pursuit of her own personal growth. While such generational struggle has been told time and time again in other Asian representative films, ""The Half of It"" presents it in a more unconventional manner.  Ellies father never explicitly pushed his expectations on her, but her reticence to leave largely hinges upon his mental incapacity. In this moment, the film flips the script on the older generations in Eastern cultures  which tend to devalue the importance of mental health  by showing that age is irrelevant when it comes to the effects of trauma.  But where ""The Half of It"" fails to meet expectations is in the film's inability to elaborate on a crucial element in Ellies familial background. Her mother who passed away was only referred to in abstract and obtuse terms throughout the narrative, leaving the tension between father and daughter unresolved. While her father was able to discuss his personal trauma with Paul, Ellie was never given the opportunity to assess the tragedy in her own terms, drawing away from her emotional complexity.  But Ellies character isnt the only one lacking depth in certain facets. Asters motivations are also inconsistent, lending to a lack of intimacy in her and Ellie's relationship. To note, Aster already lacked sufficient screen time relative to the other leads, and instead of developing her character and relationships more, her time was wasted on gratuitous scenes rehashing the pressure to conform.  The first two on-screen encounters between Ellie and Aster had practically no build-up, while the third quickly escalated into a half-naked spa session in Asters favorite secret hideout. However, the narrative flow does not warrant such easy intimacy, making it seem like the scene's primary purpose is to bait and muddy the audiences expectations.  Despite the momentary lapses in the plot and characters, it still manages to get at the heart of the contemporary love and friendship in all its heady and emoji-filled glory. And while the reliance on stock characters initially felt like a shortcut, the film is able to utilize the structures in a way to subvert expectations and introduce more depth to its characters. Moreover, the Netflix film is well-served by focusing on the pursuit rather than the attainment of love, as the characters embolden each other to start taking agency instead of remaining complacent to their current circumstances.  ""The Half of It"" is a refreshing take on the formulaic teenage rom-com and stock characters  and the endings optimism provides a sentiment that is much-needed nowadays.  &nbsp;",['cap-alyson-kong'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/aehalf.jpg

Weve already missed out on (high school graduation), this really monumental time, the incoming out-of-state first-year microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics student said. Were ending this high school chapter and moving into college, and we might not even get that proper introduction to college life.  Rivera and other incoming UCLA freshmen are not necessarily #UCLAbound  they face the possibility of being homebound as well.  UCLAs official fall quarter plans have yet to be announced, but University of California President Janet Napolitano  said  UC campuses will likely operate as a hybrid of remote and in-person instruction for fall quarter, while UCLA told departments to prepare to teach a majority of their  courses remotely .  The final plans for campus reopening in fall quarter will not be announced till mid-June, Napolitano said.  Incoming students are facing the struggles of college transition exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic: finances, adulthood, academics and social life.  Several students said financially unstable situations, a common result of the ongoing pandemic, changed their plans considerably.  Rivera said he thinks tuition fees at UCLA  over $65,000 per academic year, including housing, for out-of-state and international students  may not be justified, given that no one knows whether the full college experience can be restored.  Hes also facing a difficult financial situation: His father lost his job and his mother is uncertain if shell retain hers.  We're basically just living it out, trying to see if we will have a living wage or enough savings to put me through college or have health insurance, he said.  Students may at least save on housing costs, said Adreama Islam, an incoming international first-year applied mathematics student. Its the only good thing to come out of the situation, she said.  Islam said the F-1 student visa, which allows international students to attend a university in the United States, is the most stressful part. Many of her friends are worried they may not be able to get visas or flights in time because of travel restrictions and embassy closures, she said.  Its a very scary part for all of us, getting into your college and not being able to go,"" Islam said.  Islam said she originally planned to attend Barnard College in New York but said she chose UCLA because the coronavirus pandemic affected her familys financial capacity  Barnard costs almost $13,000 more than UCLA.  Money became an issue after the pandemic, she said. My friends had scholarships, so they had the cost thing covered. But I think its like that for a lot of people.""  Rivera also said hes concerned about being isolated in a new environment as an out-of-state student, especially given its his first time away from home.  If I wasnt scared before I am pretty scared now, because I'm going to be plummeted into the middle of Los Angeles, which already is one of the biggest hotspots (for COVID-19), he said.  When imagining himself moving to LA, he said he thinks about being responsible for himself by making sure he is following coronavirus safety measures and paying for college. Rivera added he is concerned about his physical and mental health.  It was already scary enough thinking, Oh, Im gonna be there by myself, he said. But now that we have a virus ... I dont even consider myself an adult. I may be 18 but I dont know how to deal with myself, and I dont have anyone around to help me.  Though some freshmen are struggling to reconcile their expectations of college life with the reality of social distancing, the pandemic doesnt dampen their excitement to be a Bruin.  Thomas Cluck, an incoming first-year business economics student, said he wants any sort of campus experience he can get, even if it entails going to just one class on campus and taking the rest online in a dorm.  It's always been a dream of mine to live in LA, he said. I really wanted to go to college in California. So I definitely am excited ... (and) eager to get there and be on campus.  Cluck added he knows someone who previously committed to UCLA who chose to go to USC because they thought it was more likely to commit to in-person instruction since its a private university.  Hannah Gray, an incoming in-state first-year environmental science student, said she doesnt like the idea of online classes, but she thinks if there were any place to take online classes, itd be at UCLA.  I had already pretty much decided UCLA was my choice, coronavirus or not, she said.  The thought of not going to college this year crossed her mind, but she didnt want to go through the process of applying to colleges again.  I think everyone is still excited, she said. They just also know that it might not be what they expected for their first year.  Sebastian Aguilars brother, who graduated from UCLA in 2019, filmed Aguilar's reaction as he opened his UCLA portal in his living room, surrounded by family. The video got over 5,000 views and was retweeted by the UCLA Admissions Twitter account.  Aguilar, an incoming third-year transfer political science student, said he forgot the camera was there when the screen turned yellow, flashing, Congratulations, you're a part of the Bruin family!  Aguilar participated in the Center for Community College Partnerships program, which works with California community colleges to integrate community college students into the UC. He knew hed accept an offer from UCLA if it came.  Ive seen all these movies like 'Monsters University', or all those college movies, you know? So I kind of imagine college life to be like that. Like a movie, he said.  Aguilar said he feels like there are two transitions: one social, involving friends and campus life, and one academic.  He said the social transition wouldnt be as overwhelming because it wouldnt happen at the same time as the academic one. He feels like hed be taking things one step at a time with the pandemic.  Its one of the best and worst things that could have happened, Aguilar said.  Gray echoed a similar sentiment.  I guess theres one silver lining, Gray said. Its not just me thats going through it, its the whole class of 2020 thats going through it. I just feel like Im not going to be left behind because everyones going through the same thing I am.",['cap-rayna-salam'],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/news.grad_.coronavirusfirstyears.jpg

As Jackson Lears said, distance learning is to learning as phone sex is to sex, said David Kipen, a lecturer in the UCLA Writing Program. There is an indispensable element being dispensed with here, which is rapport among a roomful of people learning together.  UCLA moved all spring quarter classes  online  March 13 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus on campus.  Professors have approached structuring their newly online courses in different ways: while some aimed to change their teaching style as little as possible, others took new approaches to teaching that they believed would better suit the format.  Students, meanwhile, had to confront the innate challenges of online learning, such as not being able to interact with classmates and staying focused. Additionally, some classes experienced lagging, audio feedback, and Zoombombings, where small numbers of users would disrupt lectures that were using the video conference service Zoom.   [Related:  Racist Zoombombing incidents at UCLA disrupt online classes and students ]   I think that we all have a pretty mutual understanding that this is going to be something new for all of us, said Kenny Kobayashi, a third-year political science student.  John Agnew, a professor in the geography and Italian departments, said professors had only a few weeks to decide how they would approach online classes.  It's really difficult, over a matter of weeks, to come up with some kind of super plan or something, that's necessarily going to work out, he said. So we're all just sort of thrashing around, trying to do the best we can.  Agnew doesnt plan to emulate an in-person class at all. Instead, he said he will post detailed lecture slides for his class online each week.  I think theres a danger of pretending (that) online, you can reproduce what you can do in an actual classroom  I think thats mistaken, he said.  Agnew wanted to make sure his class was accessible to students in all time zones. By forgoing lecture videos altogether, he hopes students will remain more focused on the material than on his facial expressions and gesticulations.  I would rather, given the circumstances, that they spend their time looking at the actual material instead of looking at me, Agnew said. I worry that then it becomes like a performance substituting for engaging with the material classes cover.  Unlike Agnew, Cynthia Lebow, a lecturer in the political science department, said she hopes to make her class as much like an in-person class as possible.  She normally uses the Socratic method in her classes, in which she asks students to answer questions in front of the class. She said she hopes to be able to continue to do this in an online setting.  Lebow also asked that her students obtain physical copies of the required reading for the class. If students have only a digital copy, they may be less likely to fully digest the reading.  I want them to buy it, have it physically, hold it, read it, highlight it, mark it up, make notes in the margins  whatever, she said.  Her class will have the same grading standards as it would if it were an in-person class, she added.  I don't think we ought to accept a lower intellectual standard just because we're doing this online, she said.   [Related:  Students may take multiple Pass/No Pass classes in the spring in light of COVID-19 ]   Kipen said he hoped to change his approach to teaching writing as little as possible. Although online classes generally pose a disadvantage to teaching, he did find one advantage in using Zoom for his lectures.  Kipen used the camera feature of Zoom to represent the presence of voice in written works. When discussing an author whose voice was noticeably present in his works, Kipen would lean in close to the camera.  However, when discussing an author whose voice was less present, he would lean away from the camera so that he was not in the center of the screen, emulating the writers decision to include less of his own voice in his works.  This is something he would not have been able to do in a regular classroom setting, he said.  Online learning poses accessibility difficulties to students. Kobayashi, an exchange student from Scotland, is currently in Japan to be with his parents. He had to drop one of his classes because the professor would not record their lectures, and he would have had to wake up in the middle of the night to attend the lecture, he said.  The online nature of classes makes it more difficult to interact with the professor and ask questions, Kobayashi said.  In a class, you might raise your hand or you might make eye contact with the professor to show that youre visibly confused with something and they will pick up on that, but in an online setting not everybody has a video on or not everybody has a microphone on and lags can take place, he said.  Additionally, classes feel much more intangible, making it harder to find motivation, said Leika Keys, a third-year political science student.  However, Keys said she finds it easier to talk to her classmates now that classes are online. One of her classes has a group chat and she is talking with her classmates more than she would have in a normal classroom setting, she said.  She said she is sympathetic toward professors.  Were all going through a lot, and I just want the professors to show the students some compassion and sympathy, and I hope the students do the same, Keys said.",['cap-emily-macinnis'],"['a-closer-look', 'campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/zoom.jpg

Despite an early close to her career, Ross owned 22 perfect 10s, five NCAA titles, eight Pac-12 titles and was a 24-time All-American over her four years as a Bruin. In her senior year, Ross recorded three perfect scores and 10 scores of 9.975s, and she finished the 2020 season ranked in the top five in the country on three events and in the all-around.    Ross was also named the Pac-12 Gymnast of the Year for the second season in a row and finished the season unbeaten in eight all-around appearances. Ross won 34 out of 45 individual events in 2020 and took first in at least two events at every meet.    Other finalists for the Honda Sport Award for gymnastics included Lexy Ramler of Minnesota, Trinity Thomas of Florida and Maggie Nichols of Oklahoma      who beat out Ross for the honor in 2019.    With the Honda Sport Award for gymnastics secured, Ross would normally be eligible for the   Honda-Broderick Cup  , which is awarded to the top collegiate female athlete across all sports.

The city of its origin has nothing to do with its disease,&#8221; said Neis, a third-year Asian American studies and ecology, behavior, and evolution student.  Neis remembers how nobody stood up for him and his friends, despite being in a crowd of Asian Americans.  &#8220;Bystanders tend to just look on, which can be very reflective of the tendency of Asian Americans to see racism and be complacent,&#8221; Neis said. &#8220;Asian Americans are in this state where they know their race and color won&#8217;t help them in the situation so there&#8217;s a sense of hopelessness associated with it.&#8221;  Neis said he would have liked to explain how the comment racialized the virus and trivialized a serious issue, but couldn&#8217;t in the middle of a concert.  He kept walking.  As the COVID-19 virus continues to spread, reported incidents of discrimination against Asian Americans have spiked as well.  According to the STOP AAPI HATE Reporting Center, founded by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action, and San Francisco State University&#8217;s Asian American Studies Department, there have been more than 1,100 self-reported physical and verbal attacks against Asian Americans in the U.S. in the latter half of March. This may not be representative of all the acts of racism around the country as many incidents go unreported.  Asian Americans are in a vulnerable state right now because of the discrimination, but the acts of racism also has called upon the Asian community to understand how other people of color regularly experience racism because of their skin color or ethnicity, Neis said.  &#8220;More than anything, we need to use this experience to invoke a sense of empathy to stand with the black community right now,&#8221; Neis said. &#8220;This is a wake-up call for Asian Americans to stand in solidarity.&#8221;   Hate comments online   Jonathan Tsai used to refrain from posting political content on TikTok, a social media platform for short videos, until he found himself a target of online hate comments.  Tsai, who has over 100,000 followers, started receiving comments on TikTok accusing him of starting the virus or eating bats once the pandemic started, he said.  People tend to show their true colors on platforms like TikTok, he said, because it is anonymous, emboldening people to say things that they would not normally say to someone&#8217;s face.  &#8220;I was getting really tired of all the videos and comments online that are racist acts against Asian Americans,&#8221; said Tsai, a first-year English and music history and industry student. &#8220;All these generalizing, racist remarks are very counterintuitive towards fighting the virus and people are choosing to focus on ignorance rather than flattening the curve.&#8221;  It has been very disheartening that many racist and hateful posts are not being taken down by TikTok, Tsai said.  Many people use the perceived collective success of Asian Americans to minimize the role racism plays in the struggles of other ethnic groups, according to an article by NPR.   &#8220;Racism towards Asian Americans has been taken casually because people think of Asian Americans as the model minority, which isn&#8217;t true,&#8221; Tsai said.   Discomfort in public   Justin Chung never thought he&#8217;d fear leaving his house.  Chung is from Corona, California, which has an 11.4% Asian population, according to  Data USA .  &#8220;I always feel a bit hesitant to go out because of my fear of how people will perceive me and treat me,&#8221; said Chung, a third-year English student.  Chung&#8217;s parents own and operate a Pinkberry frozen yogurt store in Corona. Though Chung stays at home, he said his parents still work every day and often experience discrimination from customers.  His parents often come home from work with stories of racism, he said.  Since the pandemic began, his parents noticed customers&#8217; demeanor shifted during interactions and they tended to ask about ethnicity randomly, Chung said.  &#8220;Racism has always been present and will never truly go away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The pandemic has only fueled existing racism and made it more apparent.&#8221;  Chung said although handling discrimination may be difficult, he and his parents remember that life goes on and deal with it accordingly.  &#8220;My mom told me how customers will remind them that the virus started in China and they respond that they know,&#8221; Chung said. &#8220;My parents just continue to work hard every day and understand that there are bad and good people in the world.&#8221;  Chung said he hopes that acts of racism against Asian Americans dies down as the situation with pandemic improves.  &#8220;Hopefully, Asian Americans will not have to be fearful of just living their normal lives,&#8221; Chung said.   Providing a voice for students   Angela Li, a third-year political science student, said she often worries for her parents&#8217; safety and wonders if she should return home, since she still lives on campus.  Li&#8217;s parents live in New York, in a neighborhood with one of the only testing sites in Queens. Li said she fears that, with this added foot traffic to the already-dense population of New York, her parents may be more susceptible to the virus.  Li chose to stay in Westwood and not return home for the quarter because she was scared of catching the coronavirus on the plane ride home and possibly infecting her parents.  In the meantime, Li has worked with the Asian Pacific Coalition at UCLA to create resources for dealing with hate crimes. She is the current social and cultural affairs chair of APC and the incoming director.  APC created a resource sheet of community resources for UCLA students to self-report hate crimes, maintain mental health and more. Students can access this resource on the APC Facebook page.  Li said she is also writing her senior thesis on the COVID-19 pandemic and will explore what public health means for the Asian American and Chinese communities.  Li said she plans to interview Chinese restaurants that suffered because of the pandemic to study the intersection of COVID-19 and public health for Asian Americans.  Academia in general has always been very focused on the past and does not always feel applicable to today&#8217;s issues, Li said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s important to understand the root of these hate crimes, which comes from misinformation and not knowing enough about the real narratives of how this pandemic is affecting different people, Asian Americans alike,&#8221; Li said.

To avoid the spread of COVID-19, concerts across the nation have been either canceled or postponed, leaving ticket holders in a state of limbo. Unsure of when the rescheduled dates will be, many are seeking refunds. In response, Ticketmaster &#8211; one of the largest ticket sale and distribution companies &#8211; quietly announced through a  blog post  that it won't refund customers for postponed concert tickets. Instead, refunds are left to the discretion of each individual event organizer. Ticketmaster&#8217;s tone-deaf statement hides behind the facade that its new policy will protect the safety of fans. However, it only serves to benefit its own pocketbook.  Musicians ranging from Justin Bieber to Alicia Keys and festivals such as Coachella have postponed their events to late fall at the earliest as a result of COVID-19's devastating impact on the concert industry. However, others were not as fortunate, as Governors Ball, Firefly Festival and the Isle of Wight Festival all canceled their scheduled dates. Music fans across the world are anxiously waiting for new concert dates to be announced, and in a clearly sensitive time, Ticketmaster&#8217;s reluctance to join global efforts of community building and support is shameful.   [Related:    Second Take: Online live performances proliferate, revitalize highly restrictive music industry   ]   While canceled events are guaranteed to be refunded, Ticketmaster leaves refund policies for rescheduled and postponed concerts up to the discretion of event organizers &#8211; a shifty option for a corporation that has contracts with venues as their exclusive ticket seller. Although venues have the option not to sell tickets through Ticketmaster, the company takes away logistical burdens as it handles all of the ticket distributions and operations.  In return for the company's involvement, consumers are charged service and processing fees for every ticket which is split between Ticketmaster and the venue. Ticketmaster neglecting to include this information in its public announcement shows the company further deceiving its customers, as it acts as though there is no involvement with or control over event organizers.  Essentially, the fans who have purchased tickets for the thousands of concerts and festivals that have been rescheduled now have their money frozen in the hands of event organizers. Pretending to be compassionate, Ticketmaster has waived seller fees for resale postings created from March 17 through May 31 if customers are no longer able to attend the new concert date. This aggravating alternative places an extra strain on customers in already stressful times, as they must bear the burden of selling their own tickets.     By leaving customers to do their own reselling, music lovers are paying the ultimate price. Ticketmaster has fostered an environment in which sellers will be inclined to hike up ticket prices for a profit. With the global economy in a recession, more customers than usual would be likely to want to make quick cash off ticket sales. However, not only do higher ticket prices take away opportunities for genuine fans to see artists in concert, but they also contribute to the already unfair and unethical practice of reselling tickets that artists are dealing with.  Although Ticketmaster may have altered its refund policy to maintain its company and the artists it supports, the announcement may have unintentional consequences in the future. Unfortunately, without any support from one of the largest ticket retailers, fans will likely be hesitant to buy concert tickets hereafter. And without fans to fill stadiums and theaters, the thousands of artists Ticketmaster supports through venue contracts may experience lower ticket sales.   [Related:    UCLA musicians maximize newfound time by pursuing new projects, art forms   ]    Bringing some light to these trying times, artists have stepped up to not only support their fans but the world at large. Harry Styles is one of the many artists to have rescheduled their tour dates, as he already pushed the European leg of his &#8220;Love On Tour&#8221; tour to 2021. Instead of following Ticketmaster's blueprint to prioritize    his own finances, Styles released a $26 Stay Home Stay Safe Tee on his merchandise website and will be donating all of the proceeds to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the World Health Organization. Styles, despite working with Ticketmaster for his tours, is dealing with the situation in a productive and positive manner.  While the efforts of many artists to raise and donate money for COVID-19 relief are admirable, they should not have to make up for Ticketmaster's failings. The company needs to be held responsible in a time of crisis and put the needs of the global community over its own financial security.   Simply, Ticketmaster needs to do better. COVID-19 has altered nearly all parts of life, and turning a blind eye and refusing to provide refunds for tickets at a time in which  over 22 million Americans  have filed for unemployment is nothing short of greedy. The company must begin supporting and relieving its customers, starting with rightfully refunding tickets.

The protest is one of a series of Operation Gridlock rallies across the country, including a similar march at Huntington Beach on Friday, criticizing the stay-at-home orders effect on the economy.  The orders have closed thousands of nonessential businesses, pushing over 26 million Americans into unemployment. However, experts generally agree that stay-at-home orders are necessary for bringing the current pandemic under control, and governors have enacted orders of varying strictness in 42 states, keeping at least 316 million Americans home.  Los Angeles safer at home order is set to expire&nbsp; May 15 &nbsp;while the statewide orders end date remains undecided. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that stay-at-home orders are critical in containing the coronavirus and should not be reversed anytime soon.  Most protesters circled LA City Hall and Grand Park in their cars, honking their horns and waving American flags, while some participated on foot. Many did not wear masks  the event website left the decision to use masks to the participant.  LAPD temporarily closed some streets around Civic Center during the rally, but the protest did not cause significant traffic disruptions, said Colin Sweeney, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation.  LA resident Nick Sorokin joined on foot and held a sign criticizing LA Mayor Eric Garcetti. Sorokin said Garcettis safer at home order has done more harm than the coronavirus itself.  We can't have a straitjacket approach, sledgehammer approach to private jobs, Sorokin said. Our setting needs to follow in the footsteps of the best and brightest, which is the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), (National Institutes of Health), public security and all those guys who are around (President Donald) Trump. Instead (Garcetti) has his own vision and mission, which is not good.  [caption id=""attachment_378918"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""620""]  A cyclist raises his middle finger at the protesting drivers who claim stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional. (Jintak Han/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Demetrius Brown, a Skid Row resident who has campaigned for Garcetti, was walking by when he heard Sorokin speak. Brown debated with Sorokin and defended Garcettis administration.  These people are trying to save lives, not cause more deaths, Brown said. Look at what they have done. They have been picking the homeless up off of Skid Row and placing them inside hotels, OK? Give credit where credit is due.  Although the event organizers asked participants to restrict their signage topics to First Amendment rights and reopening California, some protesters brought hats, banners and signs supporting Trump, who has publicly denounced stay-at-home orders and urged his supporters to liberate states that have enacted them.  Carmen Guillermo, who participated in the rally, said she disagrees with the Trump supporters. She said there is no politics in asking to reopen the city.  I see it as American people wanting to preserve their constitutional rights, Guillermo said. We understand that viruses do kill. Viruses are out there. We follow the recommendations of our government. But now, we find that the government's recommendations (and) their models, they weren't 100% accurate.  The protest was first organized on Facebook, but the social media giant took down the event page and the organizers account less than a day before the protest. Online communities supporting Trump quickly promoted the protest after the takedown.  Facebook did not respond to requests for comment, but it has previously stated it will keep misinformation and hoaxes about the coronavirus off its platforms.  About a dozen members of the Revolution Club, an anti-fascist activist group, also held a counterprotest on foot to support the stay-at-home orders, briefly disrupting the line of cars circling LA City Hall. Lucha Bright, a member of the Revolution Club, said she viewed her groups violation of the stay-at-home orders as necessary.  Look at what this country is doing to the world, Bright said. They don't care about the people in the world. And these people with these American flags demanding the right to their economy, they don't care either. And their ignorance is going to get people killed.  Garcetti said he is receptive to the complaints of Angelenos but refuses to let the protesters on either side sway his decision-making.  We have to keep doing this based on the medical advice, Garcetti said. That doesn't mean forever, and I appreciate everybody expressing their frustrations, but even if there's some who are saying, 'Open it up,' I look also at that polling, locally and nationally. People do trust this. People are more scared about opening up too early than too late.  A recent poll by the Associated Press found that an overwhelming majority of Americans favor stay-at-home orders and a quarter want to tighten restrictions even further.  LAPD Chief Michel Moore said one of the things the pandemic will be remembered for is how protests moved to the car.  That's keeping the public health in mind, both as an individual and the surrounding community, Moore said. We're watching this very closely and we will continue to facilitate those types of car protests, those types of disturbances or those types of demonstrations.",['cap-jhan'],"['california', 'los-angeles', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.opgridlock.JHan_-1.jpg

The five-star prospect's decision to decommit from UCLA men's basketball and join the NBA G League sent shockwaves through the internet Tuesday, but it wasn't unprecedented. Jalen Green chose the same path earlier in April, and Isaiah Todd similarly decommitted from Michigan to pursue a G League contract weeks before Nix did.  Twitter is ablaze with people claiming this is the downfall of the NCAA and that college basketball is on the brink of collapse after this series of G League thefts.  Losing three top-15 prospects to the pros certainly stings, especially on a team-to-team basis. UCLA and Michigan's recruiting classes have been completely gutted by G League intervention, and the Bruins have fallen from a potential preseason top-25 team to a middle-of-the-road Pac-12 squad.  College basketball, as a whole, will persist &#8211; but only with some major changes.  Twenty-plus years ago, this wasn't as much of a problem. Players like Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and Tracy McGrady went straight from high school to the NBA, and late 1990s college basketball didn't suffer one bit.  The association closed off that path in 2006 by changing its minimum age to 19 years old and requiring players to be at least one year removed from high school before declaring for the NBA Draft.  Nix's decision to go pro is really no different than the one Dwight Howard and LeBron James made when they were 18. No one is faulting the point guard for trying to make a career for himself and picking hundreds of thousands of dollars over a scholarship to a school he would likely leave before getting his degree.  The only difference is that instead of playing next season in the spotlight of the NBA as Bryant and James did, Nix will be buried in the shadows.  If Nix believes he is ready to turn pro, he shouldn't have to spend a year in limbo, fighting to stay relevant in bona fide high school gyms. The average attendance for regular-season G League games was 2,465 in 2019, and many teams don't even have steady TV deals.  Meanwhile, UCLA averaged 10,652 fans per home game in the 2016-2017 season and still broke the 10,000 mark multiple times in 2020.  Scouts will keep an eye on Nix wherever he goes, but the general public will not.  It is understandable that Nix is choosing the money over UCLA in this case &#8211; $300,000 for a five-month season is a difficult offer to turn down. However, Nix won't be nearly as relevant in the G League as he would have been at UCLA.  But like it was for the Hall of Famers listed above, UCLA and the G League shouldn't be his only two options.  The NBA must revoke its age limit rule and allow the best players in the world to bet on themselves again. Like it or not, the G League is a bargain bin league that very few people have ever shown interest in, and players strapped for cash shouldn't be forced to play there if college isn't right for them.  That hasn't stopped Nix from claiming the developmental league is an attractive alternative.  ""Playing in G League is basically getting me ready for the NBA draft,"" Nix said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. ""It&#8217;s just one step below the NBA.&#8221;   The NCAA is also one step below the NBA, and it boasts coaching staffs and branding that are infinitely more reputable and respected than the G League's.  Nix won't have to abide by rigid NCAA rules in the G League, which is likely part of the reason he and others are starting to drift toward that option. But a year from now, student-athletes likely won't have to follow those archaic rules either.  The NCAA announced in October that it would allow student-athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness rights, or NIL rights, in the not-too-distant future. All three divisions must have their proposed bylaws to the NCAA by the start of 2021, meaning student-athletes could be able to sign shoe deals and appear on billboards as soon as next year.  According to a report from ESPN, the group the NCAA Board of Governors tasked with researching NIL monetization in October was scheduled to present their recommendations to the board Tuesday. The group reportedly suggested student-athletes should be able to sign with agents and make money from advertisements so long as they aren't aligning themselves with banned substances and operations or referencing which school they attend.  Former Nike executive Sonny Vaccaro told USA Today on Monday that there was a top-ranked recruit who would soon be announcing his intentions to join the G League, but that he would have gone to college if he had the ability to monetize his NIL rights.  It is unclear if that unnamed player was Nix, but the point still stands &#8211; allowing these players to profit off their talent while still in school will stem the flow of top recruits to the G League in the short term.  In the long term, the NBA needs to do its part as well &#8211; top-tier players like Nix, Green and Todd shouldn't have to choose between college and the G League.  Should the NCAA follow through on its proposed rules changes, college athletes will have the freedom to make a steady income through endorsements and autographs, all while continuing to suit up for the country's most iconic and best-coached programs.  For those who still think they're above that level, all the power to them.  The NBA just has to actually give that power to them sooner rather than later.

The 24th season of the franchise features Peter Weber, a Colton Underwood look-alike nicknamed Pilot Pete. Keep reading for the Daily Bruins recap of some of the seasons most notable controversies, heartbreaks and awkward moments, along with a drink suggestion to accompany the drama.   For this seasons finale, hot chocolate is the way to go. After weeks of Peter Webers indecision and conflict  ultimately leading to a somewhat predictable flavorless ending  Bachelor Nation deserves something dependable and soothing for a change.  All this season's drama culminated in a two-night live special where episodes were injected with interviews from familiar characters. In-person audience members were also able to   see more of Peters family      for better or for worse.    The finale kicked off with Hannah Ann meeting Peters family in Australia. From the start, Hannah Ann is overcome by her love for Peter, constantly holding back tears and straining her voice when speaking to his parents. Her act quickly gained his family's approval, especially Pilot Pete's mom. She says Hannah Anns love for him is palpable, which solidifies the bachelorette as the right choice for her son.  Tasked with following up such a smooth family meeting is Madison, who is still upset with Peters decision to be intimate with other women. The pair seem to momentarily patch the cracks in their relationship in a private conversation before meeting Peters family  although Madison refuses to give Peter a kiss for reassurance.   [Related:    The Bachelor season 24 recap  episode 9   ]   Nevertheless, Peter remains madly in love despite his family's reservations. They believe the couple is too different in terms of lifestyle and beliefs to work.   The long-anticipated clip of Peter's mom crying finally arrives as she begs him to   bring Hannah Ann home, leaving Peter torn between his heart and his familys desires.  After their meeting with Peters family, he and Madison spend the rest of their time together on Uluru. Peter continues to tell cameras that he wants to have Madison in his life forever, something that he claims to have known throughout this entire journey.   Despite Pilot Petes confidence, Madisons breaks Peter's heart by leaving the show as she shares the same concerns as Peter's family.  But the show must go on, and   Peter is given no time to grieve his broken heart. The show sweeps him up to   meet with an oblivious Hannah Ann the next day to go to a kangaroo sanctuary. Taking comfort in Hannah Ann's unrelentless love and support for him, Peter separately tells the camera that she is who he would have chosen in the end.   But   his statement seems to be more of an attempt to convince himself rather than a declaration of any undying love.  With only one bachelorette left in the race, there is no decision for Peter to make.   However, Hannah Ann begins to question his emotional availability to her, foreshadowing upcoming turmoil. She develops cold feet prior to the rose ceremony   but changes her mind at the last minute, relieving Peter of the reality that he just might be stood up at the altar.  Hannah Ann perilously walks in heels on rocky ground to meet Peter, still unaware that she is the only one showing up. Peter takes her hands in his and proposes,   slipping in the fact that she was his only option. Hannah Ann, swept up in the excitement of the occasion, doesnt have a moment to process this information and happily accepts the ring. Peters mom is also hysterical at the   desired engagement, crying tears of relief rather than happiness.  Back at the live viewing of the show, however, Chris Harrison   shows a clip of the engaged couple after some time has passed, and their future   looked nowhere near happily ever after. Peter is still hung up on Madison and distances himself from Hannah Ann, going a whole month without seeing her after their engagement.   [Related:    Second Take: The Bachelor promotes toxic double standards of sexuality   ]   Hannah Ann later flies to Los Angeles to confront Peter over the unrequited love. But her visit ends in heartbreak as she stands   up for herself, bringing to attention the unbalanced nature of their relationship.   Back in front of the live audience, Peter's mom claps in agreement as Hannah Ann rehashes the fact that Peter failed to treat her right.     When it seems that this may be the disappointing end of Peter's journey,   Chris takes matters into his own hands and   secretly meets with Madison in Auburn, Alabama. Peters ex  unaware of all the events that had transpired  admits to still loving the Bachelor and regretting her actions. While this clip is being played, Peters mom   simmers with fiery contempt for Madison.  But her anger is no match for Chris' matchmaking skills, and Madison decides to   hop on a plane to surprise Peter in Los Angeles anyway.   They seem to rekindle their relationship with a sweet embrace and shared feelings, instilling hope in Bachelor Nation that perhaps this Bachelor wont end up alone. After Madison and Peter discussed their next steps on stage, Chris naturally had to ask Peters parents about their opinion on the situation. His mom unleashes her disapproval of Madison and Peter's dad seconds her opinion   albeit   in a much less scathing manner.  Despite the confrontation and blatant disapproval, Madison and Peter defend themselves with grace and maturity. They both wish to move on from the past, seeming committed to each other and their future. It's undeniable that there remains an awkwardness between them, however, leaving room for Peter's family to be proven correct. Either way, yet another season in ""The Bachelor"" franchise ends without the promise of engagement. And with a new Bachelorette just announced, ""The Bachelor"" brand of reality television and true love could be on rocky shores.  The ending of Pilot Pete's journey seemed rushed and riddled with gaps in time, making for an anticlimactic season finale that raises more questions than a sense of satisfaction.",['cap-phoebe-chen'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/155318_9472.jpg

The episode, which aired Sunday night, is entirely contingent upon   a fake vat   of acid. Strategically placed at key plot points, the running gag suddenly becomes an effective vehicle to examine the role of consequences &#8211; particularly in a universe where slip-ups can be easily concealed by scientific contrivances. Rick&#8217;s fake vat of acid parlor trick begins as a ploy to scam a gang of alien gem-dealers, catalyzing his need to be the smartest person in the room at all times.   His latest invention, built after Morty mocks his fake vat of acid scheme, reinforces the show's habit of enabling Rick to achieve everything within the realm of scientific possibility &#8211; except fail.  And while this habit is useful for pushing the ingenuity of his inventions, Rick&#8217;s demigod status is a reflection of his tendency to &#8220;use intelligence to justify sickness,&#8221; directly echoing the words of the family psychiatrist in season three. Unlike last season, however, &#8220;The Vat of Acid Episode&#8221; is less than critical of Rick&#8217;s megalomania.  The episode opens in a nuclear plant after an illegal gem exchange goes awry, ending with Rick and Morty jumping into a fake vat of acid prepared beforehand. The vat is hilarious in its convolution, complete with compartments of human bones that float to the surface, aiding the illusion of death by acid. Moreover, when one of the aliens throws a rat in the acid to test its toxicity, Rick painstakingly carves tiny rat bones to set free &#8211; a ruse that works even when Morty accidentally releases the human-sized bones alongside them.   [Related:    TV review: 7th &#8216;Rick and Morty&#8217; episode fails to build on borrowed sci-fi plots ]     However, the episode makes the same mistakes of its predecessors as the actual plot that has been introduced so far has little relevance to the episode as a whole. Neither the nuclear plant nor the aliens are important. In an odd upheaval of narrative structure, the emphasis is placed instead on the perceived symbolic meaning of the vat itself, rather than any of the events the viewer has been following. As they return to their ship, Morty berates Rick for the unoriginality of his fake acid vat scheme, accusing his grandfather of never listening to his ideas.  Back in their garage, Morty becomes increasingly frustrated and insinuates Rick does not listen to his ideas because he&#8217;s incapable of creating them, citing a place-saving video game for life as an example. Rick feverishly drills away before he ostensibly admits Morty is right &#8211; then murders him on the spot   and uses his newly built place-saving device to reverse it.   The idea of Rick failing, just as much as the idea of Morty succeeding at literally anything, is played for laughs. While Rick&#8217;s delicious pettiness is certainly on-brand entertainment, its ham-fisted repetition prevents further insight into his and Morty&#8217;s characters. Episodes like season three&#8217;s &#8220;Pickle Rick,&#8221; which introduces a family psychiatrist who is unfazed by Rick&#8217;s pickle put-on, demonstrate his impressive intellect while also criticizing how he uses it to validate his own toxicity.   [Related:    &#8216;Killing Eve&#8217; season 3 recap &#8211; episode 5: &#8216;Are You From Pinner?&#8217;       ]   The rest of the episode is largely dedicated to Morty&#8217;s antics with the place-saver device, which allows him to effectively redo moments in time without consequence.   Some of the montage sequences are blissfully mundane, with Morty using the device to get more free samples of ice cream or to reorder a dish at a restaurant. Others are pointlessly cruel and not explained by Morty&#8217;s newfound ability to erase consequences. After all, what does he gain by pushing an old man in a wheelchair into the street?  Back in Rick&#8217;s garage, Morty learns that the device doesn&#8217;t actually prevent his consequences but displaces them into other versions of reality. Morty, torn apart with guilt, allows Rick to converge his actions into the present reality.  However, unlike his grandson, Rick is never tasked with the burden of consequence, even having committed far worse atrocities in past episodes. His holier-than-thou speech to Morty, ironic or not, disregards the power Rick holds to shape reality away from the shrapnel of his explosive path.  With masses of angry entities like AARP, the American Civil Liberties Union and Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor gathered in the yard, Morty prepares for his final reckoning &#8211; only for Rick to provide a solution in the form of a fake vat of acid. The petty payoff is a satisfying full circle to the episode's title but perhaps an unsatisfying resolution to Rick's character as a whole.  Because while Morty wearily submerges himself in fake acid, Rick once again rises to the top &#8211; bones and all.

The remainder of the Pac-12 mens basketball tournament, all upcoming postseason events and every other Pac-12 game has been canceled, the conference said in a statement released Thursday morning. The conference announced Wednesday it would be limiting attendance at all events to essential personnel only, but now not even the players will take the field or court in the coming weeks.    UCLA mens basketballs conference tournament run, which was scheduled to begin against California on Thursday night, will be canceled as a result.

The annual event, usually held in Pauley Pavilion, will transition to a virtual platform in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The constraints of Zoom and YouTube Live, where the event will be held this year, pose challenges for such a large-scale gathering, such as navigating potential technical issues. Despite these difficulties, organizers from the Pediatric AIDS Coalition at UCLA have attempted to preserve as many elements from the physical event   as possible, said PAC president and fourth-year neuroscience and Spanish student Sophie Ahmad.  Being held Saturday to honor the original event, Dance Marathon will aim to destigmatize HIV/AIDS by bringing awareness to the UCLA and broader Los Angeles community, Ahmad said. She added that the virtual experience will also address the intersectionality of HIV/AIDS in relation to COVID-19, emphasizing how the latest pandemic affects those with other conditions.  Were encouraging everyone to stand the entire time like we normally would  we know that its not 26 hours, but we hope people still get a little taste of what it feels like, Ahmad said. This also allows people who have never been able to come to watch  like my grandmas going to be able to come for the first time.  This year, encouraging participants to Unite, Dance Marathon will be divided into three sections to account for the shorter time period: ""Learn,"" ""Remember"" and ""Unite."" The ""Learn"" section will introduce the events mission of raising awareness for HIV/AIDS, while ""Remember"" will serve as a stand-in for the annual vigil held to honor the victims of the condition, Ahmad said. During the vigil, child ambassadors from the beneficiary Camp Laurel will share their stories with the audience. She said the last portion, ""Unite,"" will be the most upbeat portion of the event, featuring performers and a reveal of how much the organization has raised for the cause.   [Related:    Student musicians support AIDS awareness in waning hours of Dance Marathon   ]   Because of the technical challenges of gathering a large number of speakers and performers, Dance Marathon will have a combination of live speakers from both UCLA Health and PACs primary beneficiary, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and prerecorded content largely from performers. Appurva Goel, PACs executive director of outreach and fourth-year economics and communication student, said the organizations goal is to retain the spirit of the physical event by balancing the way content is transmitted for Dance Marathon. She said the virtual event also provides an opportunity to bring in speakers from outside the LA area and will feature speakers from New York and Oregon.  We have essentially pulled together this event in three to four weeks, as opposed to usually a year of planning, Goel said. One way we worked with this was finding the perfect balance between prerecorded videos and speakers.  The events performers, which will consist primarily of UCLA students and alumni, will be a mix of a cappella, bands, solo artists and dance groups, Ahmad said. Drag queen Lorelei  a staple of Dance Marathon in the past  will also return to perform and provide LGBTQ+ representation. Third-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student Akshay Anand will perform his original song Cherry, written specifically for the event, during the vigil. He said the song is based on the looming feeling of uncertainty that has characterized the past month.   [Related:    Dance Marathon 2020 cancelled following COVID-19 concerns   ]   I wrote this song about being stuck at home and being afraid of losing the memories that I made, (and) not being able to share with people the stories that fade away, Anand said. Its about being alone in a time when you want to be surrounded by people and appreciating the time you have with others, which I thought fit well with this period.    Beyond uniting students over shared feelings of isolation and loss, Goel said this years Dance Marathon aims to highlight the continued existence of HIV/AIDS in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly given the potentially adverse effects of COVID-19 upon those already suffering from the immunodeficiency virus. She said she hopes the event will act as a reminder that the pandemic exacerbates existing issues like HIV/AIDS by drawing attention to the intersectionality of the viruses.  We want this event to be a break for students and participants to break beyond the four walls of their house and do something different to try to bring some normalcy into our corner, Goel said. But we also want to show that the pandemic has a very tangible impact on a lot of other things right now as well.",['cap-kaia-sherry'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/1d4a1283.jpg

The curfew will be implemented for one night from 8 p.m. on Saturday to 5:30 a.m. on Sunday  .   Garcetti extended the curfew for another day at a press conference Sunday. The curfew will remain in place from 8 p.m. on Sunday until 5:30 a.m. on Monday.  The curfew will remain over the entire city of Los Angeles.  Garcetti said the goal is to keep all Los Angeles citizens safe and give law enforcement and firefighters space to keep the peace.   The curfew was put in place to increase the safety of demonstrators, law enforcement and all Los Angeles citizens, Garcetti said.   Garcetti enacted the curfew in response to several protests around LA, including a protest where a police car was burned down near West Hollywood that was declared an unlawful assembly by the Los Angeles Police Department around 5 p.m.  Garcetti extended the curfew across the entire city of LA, with an exemption for people traveling between work, people seeking emergency medical care and emergency responders, according to several tweets from Garcetti.  The city of Beverly Hills is also on curfew over the same time period, according to a tweet from Lili Bosse, the mayor of Beverly Hills.  The curfew will be placed downtown but police will be monitoring all parts of the city.  Garcetti said COVID-19 testing centers in LA were temporarily closed for safety reasons.  Certain COVID-19 testing centers in Los Angeles will remain closed Monday, Garcetti said at the Sunday press conference. He added that the Dodger Stadium testing center would remain open  Monday .  Right now, it is so critical for us to reestablish the peace in this city, so that we can do that work and have those conversations, Garcetti said at a press conference.  Protests in LA near the Fairfax District on Saturday resulted in a standoff between police officers and protesters. Many buildings were vandalized and several LAPD cars were set on fire.  Just under 400 arrests were made at the Saturday protests, said LAPD Chief of Police Michel Moore.  The protests started after George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died while under police custody in Minneapolis. Footage of his arrest shows a police officer arresting Floyd with his knee on his neck.  The prosecutors report said the police officer had kept his knee on Floyds neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Video footage shows Floyd repeatedly telling the police officer that he could not breathe. Floyd was pronounced dead an hour later at the Hennepin County Medical Center.","['cap-saumya-gupta', 'cap-shruti-iyer']","['los-angeles', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.breakingcurfew.TS_.jpg

To be fair, the movie does have its share of the latter, but hidden among the gore and the gunshots are characters with surprising emotional depth and development. &#8220;Extraction  ,&#8221; releasing Friday on Netflix, is the premiere directorial effort of &#8220;Avengers: Endgame&#8221; stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, whose incredible action sequences demonstrate his mastery of stunt work. The film pairs Chris Hemsworth &#8211; in his bread and butter action role as a macho gunman mercenary &#8211; with Rudhraksh Jaiswal, who portrays a young and innocent foil to Hemsworth&#8217;s hardened character. Thankfully, the stars' roles make more use of their range of acting than action movies normally do.     [Related:    Movie review: '21 Bridges' fails to develop characters with archetypal action-movie plot   ]   The film begins with Ovi Mahajan (Jaiswal), a 14-year-old scion of an Indian drug lord, being kidnapped by the criminal agents of a Bangladeshi crime boss. Hemsworth, portraying Tyler Rake, is hired to rescue   and extract him back to India &#8211; a mission that imminently goes awry.   Without delay, the action begins, as Tyler goes to work dismantling heavily armed enemies with adrenaline-inducing, mind-numbing combat. Tyler is able to secure Ovi early on in the movie, but the central conflict of the rest of the film is focused on the long journey out of Bangladesh after his extraction plan fails.    The first half of &#8220;Extraction&#8221; primarily follows Tyler defeating a horde of unnamed enemies as he ferries Ovi through the city of Dhaka toward India. Fight sequences follow the pair as they are chased by cars through the open streets, then relentlessly pursued through cramped apartment rooms and walkways. The action sequences are engaging and grounded, with the impact of every bullet and punch felt through the palpable sound design and Hemsworth&#8217;s gritty acting.     Hargrave's talents as a stunt coordinator are on full display in the intensely thrilling combat, especially as a shaky camera follows Tyler from apartment rooftops to car chases without a single cut. The added dimension of Tyler having to protect the defenseless Ovi from hostiles creates a tension that is otherwise absent in action movies &#8211; especially ones where the main character is as skilled and seemingly unbeatable as Tyler is.  Despite the exhilarating combat, however, the initial half of the film does little to challenge the conventional norms of a mindless action movie. Tyler does exhibit kindness under his rough exterior as he starts to genuinely care for Ovi as more than just a mission target. But besides these actions in protecting Ovi from enemies, there is little character development or exploration for a full hour of the film.   [Related:    Movie review: It&#8217;s not just the boys who are bad, the movie is too   ]   Luckily, once the midpoint is reached, &#8220;Extraction&#8221; shifts emotional gears, providing Ovi and Tyler the space for a heart to heart during a brief respite from their chase.  Ovi&#8217;s character is precocious and relatable, demonstrating guilt over his father&#8217;s criminal activities and an interest in Tyler as a person. Tyler, in turn, displays an emotional sensitivity stemming from a heartbreaking backstory   which he confides to Ovi. Their relationship   becomes the crux of the film and makes them more relatable than ordinary action characters &#8211; although this is mainly because of Hemsworth and Jaiswal&#8217;s poignant acting rather than any unique writing.  The bond between Tyler and Ovi increases the suspense in the latter half of the movie as well. Tyler's desperation to return Ovi home as he fights through Dhaka becomes more dramatic and sympathetic, making &#8220;Extraction&#8217;s"" second half and ending more moving than a typical action   thriller normally is.  However, while the film may be more stirring than its more braindead competitors, it's still primarily     focused on gore and combat. For every minute of sensitivity in character, there are 10 minutes of pure adrenaline. And while this means that the characters cannot be completely fleshed out in the two-hour screen time of &#8220;Extraction,&#8221;   the heartwarming   interplay between Jaiswal and Hemsworth prevents the film from being another piece of shallow entertainment.  Between the two co-stars, their rare, quieter scenes provide the emotional foundation that elevates &#8220;Extraction&#8221; from an ordinary action flick to a legitimately moving film.

Words, but no action.   These contradictions occurred well before our tenure as campus leaders but were first encountered within the 2019-2020 academic year during finals week of winter quarter. As other institutions across the country eliminated strenuous examinations, extended spring breaks to allow students to adjust, and offered substantial financial support for students amidst the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic, UCLA&#8217;s Academic Senate offered mere recommendations &#8211; no requirements.  We know what happened next.  Not only were many of these recommendations outright ignored by countless faculty across the university, but, for many students, it was too little, too late. Finals were already underway, and students had no recourse to change possibly damaging grades to Pass/No Pass or eliminate them altogether.  But, this isn't the end of the story.  As spring quarter began, the 2019-2020 Undergraduate Students Association Council and other student leaders released a  series of demands  to accommodate the needs of and promote equity for students. These recommendations centered around both the accessibility of courses for students who are unable to attend at specific hours of the day and calling on UCLA to implement universal Pass/No Record grading for all students with the possible option of revealing grades. We urge UCLA&#8217;s Academic Senate to consider implementing these recommendations in the future.  It is clear now that, had UCLA&#8217;s Academic Senate and administration listened to student leaders then, students would not be burdened with the same degree of inequity in their courses that exists now.  And now, once again, many of our most vulnerable Bruins face nearly identical circumstances. Many faculty continue to  outright dismiss  the effects of systemic racism on Black students and are unwilling to accommodate students beyond the bare minimum, despite other universities taking clear actions months ago in an attempt to address inequities in education relating to COVID-19 and violence against Black people.  Moving forward, UCLA must move beyond simply  tweeting out solidarity , and act on it. Whether that be holding professors accountable for their insensitive emails, taking actual steps toward the development of safe and welcoming spaces for Black students on campus and addressing inequities in academics that will continue far beyond this academic year.  After all, you are what you do, not what you say you&#8217;ll do.    Until then, UCLA&#8217;s solidarity will be no more than a tweet with no traction.

And for the California State Lottery, which amassed nearly a staggering  $7 billion  in 2018 alone, the rise in profits has seen a disturbing rise in problems for California's public school students.  In late February, a statewide audit revealed the California Lottery  owes  $36 million to the state&#8217;s public K-12 schools, community colleges   and institutions of higher education     &#8211; and that figure is only for the 2017-2018 fiscal year.  Established in   1984 to provide  additional funding  to California&#8217;s public schools, the California Lottery initially pledged  34%  of its annual revenues to the state&#8217;s public education system. However, in 2010, the state legislature removed this requirement and instead allowed the Lottery Commission to arbitrarily determine an amount that  &#8220;maximizes&#8221;  funding for public education.  While school districts across the state have effectively been robbed of millions of dollars, perhaps no district stands to suffer as acutely as the Los Angeles Unified School District. In January 2019, a  six-day teacher strike  over  low wages and inadequate funding  wracked the country's  second-largest  school district. A little more than a year later, voters  rejected  a bond proposal that would have given California's public schools $15 billion to upgrade aging infrastructure.  The LAUSD simply cannot afford to lose more money, particularly from an agency whose mission is to fund public education.   State legislators have a moral obligation to hold the California Lottery to higher standards of accountability. To start, officials must impose regular audits and pass legislation that establishes a stricter allocation of the California Lottery's revenue. In addition to increasing schools&#8217; budgets for more teachers, textbooks and technological equipment, such measures can help the LAUSD prepare for unexpected emergencies, such as the public health  crisis  the United States now finds itself in.   And with  no end  in sight to the current COVID-19 pandemic, this increased accountability will help the district mitigate the devastating impacts of school closures and lost instructional time.  Because in times of crisis, students should not be left to shoulder the failings of an unchecked and irresponsible system.  Currently,  85%  of students in the LAUSD live in households that fall below the poverty line. As schools across Los Angeles transition to online classes for the  remainder  of the academic year in response to a statewide order, students without the resources to afford technology and reliable access to Wi-Fi are excluded from receiving an education simply by virtue of their socioeconomic status.   Jasmine Lozano, a sixth grade teacher at Dr. Julian Nava Learning Academy in Los Angeles, said school closures have made it more challenging to educate her students as an already fragile education system   deals with   the fallout of the   coronavirus outbreak.  ""Access to technology (and the) internet has been the largest issue, even when we&#8217;ve provided the resources and materials for it,"" Lozano said. ""I&#8217;ve been on and off the phone for weeks with parents trying to make this all happen.""  While the district has taken  steps  to eradicate barriers to online learning, students are still struggling.   LAUSD Superintendent Austin Beutner  reported  that one-third of the district&#8217;s 120,000 high schoolers have not attended classes daily since the start of remote learning on March 16.  For Remi Torres, a UCLA   doctoral student who specializes in research on early childhood and psychology, this is unsurprising.   &#8220;All children do not have equal resources to computers, good internet, books (or) intellectually stimulating materials,&#8221; Torres said. &#8220;Learning remotely is also not something children are used to and is more challenging for students that are already underperforming.&#8221;  Any additional dollars would have gone a long way in providing better services to students in a time of crisis, whether it be  meals ,  laptops  or training in online education for both teachers and parents, who, Lozano said, often cannot secure stable internet access for their children due to language barriers.     Without the proper infrastructure to secure funding, schools will be left scrambling for additional resources during unprecedented times, leaving already marginalized populations hung out to dry. And within the LAUSD, those populations are not insignificant. Currently, an upward of  17,000  students are homeless. For these students and their families, the pandemic will only exacerbate haphazard living circumstances.  &#8220;The COVID-19 pandemic is exposing injustices already in place,&#8221; said Hannah Chung, a UCLA medical student and co-director of communications for the organization Los Angeles COVID Volunteers. &#8220;The call to self-isolate and stay at home is an order that is a luxury for those who have a place to call home and for those whose jobs can be done through a computer.&#8221;  Another injustice is disparities in mental health. According to a recent  study , the economic impacts of COVID-19 on low-income families has led to a decline in the mental health of both parents and children.   Torres said that poor mental health will interfere with students' ability to learn and retain information, meaning the LAUSD may need to allocate more resources toward ensuring students are caught up on instructional material once schools open.   But the funding to do so   will not appear out of thin air.   Considering the long-term effects of this pandemic, it is necessary for California to implement higher standards of transparency for the California Lottery to ensure that public schools get what they need &#8211; and deserve &#8211; in the years to come.   Although money from the California Lottery accounts for only about  1%  of the state&#8217;s annual education budget, the lottery system has given a total of  $34.2 billion  to public education since its establishment nearly 40 years ago. The cumulative benefits of these funds for students, particularly those who are at a higher risk of subpar educational outcomes, would outweigh any additional costs incurred by the state for imposing stricter accountability measures.  California must hold its institutions to a higher standard.  Because without such foresight, the problems will only continue to grow &#8211; in both number and severity.

Happily,   &#8220;Promortyus&#8221; sheds the smugness of last week&#8217;s episode &#8211; favoring the endorphin rush of hijacks and hijinks the show is known for &#8211; yet fails to execute a concept that feels wholly original.  As the episode&#8217;s title foreshadows, &#8220;Promortyus&#8221; runs the gamut of sci-fi franchises but does not meaningfully add to the genre&#8217;s repertoire, making viewers wish they&#8217;d just rewatched &#8220;Prometheus&#8221; instead.  Traversing through the New York City-esque metropolis of Glorzo, Rick and Morty realize the tentacled aliens have attached themselves to unsuspecting hosts, using their bodies to industrialize their planet. While under control of the Glorzo, Rick spouts ""alt-right"" talking points and touts miracle pills on YouTube in an Alex Jones spoof, becoming the planet&#8217;s laughingstock. Meanwhile, to Rick&#8217;s chagrin, Glorzo Morty is a world-renowned scientist.    While the Glorzo gag cleverly alludes to worldbuilding elements that become important later in the plot, the aliens themselves are underwhelming. With a cyclopslike eye placed strategically atop a mass of writhing tentacles, the Glorzo are eerily reminiscent of the classic Daleks from ""Doctor Who"" when unarmored &#8211; with parasitic Daleks featured in its latest season. L  ike with   &#8220;Prometheus,&#8221; the Glorzo characterization exists primarily to earn brownie points from casual followers of the sci-fi nerd canon.   [Related:    TV review: Layers of irony in 'Never Ricking Morty' derail narration, criticize show's fanbase]    Meanwhile, Rick and Morty are exposed as impersonators when the duct tape on their faces isn&#8217;t as strong as they had hoped. Shooting through a horde of hosts, the duo find their spaceship and zoom around the planet in an enthralling ""Star Wars""-esque battle of exploding tentacles.    This leads to one of the episode&#8217;s funniest moments as     Rick and Morty fly toward the Glorzo rendition of the twin towers, lasers poised &#8211; veering off at the last second to lay waste to the Glorzo Pearl Harbor instead. Subverting expectations that the show swerve away from cheap 9/11 jokes, the humor derives from the notion that Pearl Harbor is somehow the more tasteful choice, emphasizing the complete moral vacuum of the show's titular characters. These one-offs, though not intrinsic to the storyline, are certainly inextricable from the well-known brand of off-color humor in &#8220;Rick and Morty.""  Leaving behind a decimated planet, Rick and Morty return home to a normal family dinner with Morty&#8217;s parents, who remark on the absence of his sister, Summer. The two realize they forgot Summer on Glorzo and race back, only to find her as the pampered empress of the Glorzo through an oddly placed flashback sequence.   [Related:    'Killing Eve' season 3 recap          &#8211; episode 4: 'Still Got It'   ]   In a cave full of wet eggs set in the flashback, Rick and Morty become Glorzo hosts while Summer learns the species lay eggs in their hosts before exploding 30 minutes after their birth. She helpfully recommends, &#8220;Maybe, uh, don&#8217;t do that?&#8221; and is crowned queen. With her teenage drawl and pointedly blas&#233; attitude, Summer&#8217;s ascension to power is a far more hilarious use of her character than as a placeholder in Morty&#8217;s imagination in &#8220;Never Ricking Morty.&#8221;  The flashback moves to follow Rick and Morty&#8217;s Glorzo selves, Bruce and Steve, respectively, who overcome a mutual enmity and begin to make out. Uncomfortably, the scene seems to believe that gayness in and of itself is a punchline. There&#8217;s not much humor, just the initial gross-out of implied incest. In fact, the scene banks on the same self-impressed immaturity as when Chang from &#8220;Community&#8221; yells &#8220;Ha, gay!&#8221; in a classroom discussion about respect   &#8211; e  xcept without the irony.  In the last moments of the episode, having caught up to present events, the three escape   into the spaceship by Morty playing a harmonica   &#8211; a reference that&#8217;s too specific to be generally appealing and too nonsensical to work on its own. Similarly, the episode as a whole relies too much on other franchises without adding anything to the tropes it capitalizes upon, as demonstrated by the show's final scene.   At home, Rick and Morty are overcome with stomach pain and believe they&#8217;re about to lay Glorzo eggs, an ending that appropriately encapsulates &#8220;Promortyus.&#8221;   Rather than birthing a new, original species &#8211; or episode idea &#8211;   it turns out they just have to fart.

Her son  Mikey Perez  was just a toddler, traveling with his mother and the UCLA softball team in Oklahoma City when he walked for the first time in a hotel room, with the whole team surrounding him.  ""All (of my mom's) players, I still know them today,"" Perez said. ""And I always hear the good old, 'You were so small last time I saw you. So its nice to have those connections in her softball world, even today.  Thanks to his mother's position as a coach for UCLA softball since 1994, Perez grew up around the program, constantly exposed to the sport and the team. For Inouye-Perez, that meant it was never hard to come by a babysitter on the road  she had around 20 players who were more than happy to watch her son.  But for the now-UCLA baseball sophomore infielder, his relationship with his mother instilled a passion for both baseball and softball, and a love for the Bruins that would guide him to be the player he is today.  ""Just being around the school for so long, its always been a dream to come and play baseball here,"" Perez said.  Perez was born into an athletic family. His father, Gerardo Perez, played college baseball at Loyola Marymount and now coaches the baseball team at Gahr High School  Mikey Perezs alma mater  in Cerritos, California. Mikey Perez's mother has won eight national championships with UCLA softball  three as a player, three as an assistant coach and two as the head coach.  But Inouye-Perez was one decision away from never winning her last four titles.  When Perez was born in 2000, Inouye-Perez was in her seventh year as an assistant coach for the Bruins softball team. She was prepared to step down from her role to commit herself to raising Perez, but then-head coach Sue Enquist convinced her not to.  I knew the commitment to the program, Inouye-Perez said. I told coach Enquist that I think it would be best for me to head in a different direction and she said just the opposite. She said, No way, we can put a playpen in the bullpen, well do whatever you need. So it was really encouraging to do both.  Growing up with two coaches in the family, there was plenty of athletic wisdom to be passed on. However, Inouye-Perez said she always made a devotion to herself and to her son.  She was going to be a mom to him and a coach to her players.  ""(My parents) have always done a great job of not being overwhelming with overcoaching,"" Perez said. ""They definitely do a great job of making sure to separate being a coach and being a parent, and knowing when to be one or the other.""  But with Inouye-Perez's natural coaching instincts, the line between mom and coach did almost   get blurred every now and then.  There was a moment one time when my husband wanted me to get on (Perez) for something, Inouye-Perez said. And I did with kind of a coach-y tone, and Ill never forget the look on his face  just, Wait, what? And then I made a decision. I didn't want to be in that role, I didn't want to be his coach. I was always his mom.  When it came time for Perez to be recruited for college ball, it was another new experience for Inouye-Perez. She had gone through recruitment herself as a player, and now she did it on a yearly basis as the head coach of the winningest collegiate softball program in the nation.  This time around, she would be experiencing recruitment as a parent.  For Perez, he said the decision to commit to UCLA upon his graduation from high school was easy. He had grown up roughly 35 miles from UCLA, attending baseball games and softball games alike in the hills of Westwood  his whole word was in Southern California, and he said he knew he wanted to stay close to home.  UCLA baseball coach John Savage said he knew that having two coaches for parents and frequently being around the environment of a strong collegiate athletic program were good building blocks for a player like Perez.  Youre talking about him growing up in a very competitive atmosphere, growing up going to UCLA softball and baseball games and really growing up a Bruin, Savage said. He checks a lot of boxes when you talk about personality, talent and love for the school. He knows what it takes to be a Bruin.  Once Perez made it to UCLA, the dynamic with his parents changed. In high school, he spent the majority of his time with his dad, being on the same campus and team. In college, the roles flipped and Perez said he sees his mom much more than his dad.  While the run-ins arent frequent, Perez and Inouye-Perez are both grateful for the moments they have together.  ""When I do have some downtime, when I don't have classes certain days, we're able to go into Westwood and get some breakfast, which is always nice,"" Perez said. ""My roommates and I, and some of the other baseball guys, will try to go over to (Easton) Stadium and support (the softball team). It's also good for me to catch up with the people that have helped me grow up in the softball world.""  Similarly, when Inouye-Perez finds time in her schedule, she said she has always taken the opportunity to see her son in action as a Bruin.  After UCLA softball had mercy-ruled Cal Poly on March 8, Inouye-Perez told the team she had to shorten the postgame festivities so she could rush across town to Dedeaux Field, where UCLA baseball was taking on USC in the Southern California College Baseball Classic.  In what would ultimately be UCLAs final game of the season, Mikey Perez made his ninth start of 2020 and racked up a career-high three hits in the Bruins 15-3 win over the Trojans.  She definitely must have brought some good luck or something, Perez said. It was good that I was able to have a decent performance in front of her. That was really nice to see her there.  Since the end of their respective seasons and the announcement of the stay-at-home order because of the coronavirus, Perez said he's taken up cooking  preparing for life in off-campus apartments next year. The sophomore sometimes makes meals for the whole family, with his favorite dish being spareribs, a recipe passed down from his mother's side.  But Perez's new adventures in the kitchen aren't the only way he and his mom have connected while quarantined. The two said they like to watch Netflix and go on masked bike rides together.  ""(Staying at home has) definitely been a bit of change,"" Perez said. ""Its nice just to get that family time that we don't usually have, (with) everybody out and about, busy with seasons of their own.""  When the measures are lifted and quarantine comes to an end, the Perez household will be able to return to their normal, busy lives.  Until then, Perez and his mom are at home, as a family.

LA COVID-19 Volunteers , established by UCLA medical students last month, now has over 300 student volunteers, who are assisting families of health care workers with free services such as child care, pet sitting and errands. LACV is also helping to make and distribute personal protective equipment and cloth face masks to those at greatest risk of infection.  The group consists of four teams, each focused on a different area of service: personal protective equipment recruitment, health care worker services, community partnerships and communications.  The volunteer group began as separate COVID-19 relief efforts, headed by UCLA medical students. UCLA medical student and third-year class vice president Sarah Andebrhan reached out to these students and connected them into one cohesive health care initiative, which became LACV.  We are really pleased by the outpouring of support from the community, our Bruins on the UCLA campus and our many supporters, volunteering to provide child care for our employees, offering to bring in meals for those working, and assist in any way possible to confront this pandemic, said Johnese Spisso, president of UCLA Health.  Andebrhans initial goal was to develop a support system for students and workers with children. Andebrhan worked with fellow third-year medical student and young mother Elyse Conley to establish LACV.  Andebrhan connected Conley to third-year medical student Mona Deng, who reached out to an existing COVID-sitter program at the University of Minnesota in order to create a similar model in LA.  Conley and Deng became co-directors of what is now the health care worker services team. Their team assists in matching families of health care workers with volunteers who buy and deliver groceries to them, and offer babysitting and pet-sitting services.  LACV expanded to include personal protective equipment management after Andebrhan contacted David Geffen School of Medicine Vice Dean for Education Clarence Braddock, who informed her of similar efforts by first-year medical students like Rose Paneno.  The personal protective equipment team, which is now managed by Paneno, has several ongoing initiatives, including a program to ask local businesses in the greater LA area for donations of personal protective equipment supplies, such as medical grade face shields, surgical gowns, goggles and N95 masks.  We are trying to see if any local businesses like tattoo parlors, nail salons, dentist offices, textile and clothing makers are willing to donate to hospitals in need, ... as these businesses tend to have a lot of these materials and they are shut down because of social distancing protocols, Paneno said.  Although Paneno hopes to expand the delivery of personal protective equipment, at the moment volunteer efforts are focused on Olive View and Harbor UCLA medical centers, the two facilities in greatest need within the UCLA Health system.  As we expand, we will be able to provide more resources to other hospitals as well, Paneno said. But right now, those are the two that have reached out to us and said that they have the greatest need at this time.  The personal protective equipment team is also leading efforts to create disposable face shields needed by health care workers in the UCLA Health system. Volunteers have created nearly 6,650 face shields so far.  Conley, health care worker services co-director of LACV, has begun fundraising via  GoFundMe  for a new initiative within LACV called LA COVID Food Corps.  The money will be used to purchase at least 200 hot meals per week for janitorial staff, emergency department and internal care unit physicians in one of LAs  safety-net hospital  s , Harbor UCLA Medical Center, where staff treat some of the sickest and most socioeconomically vulnerable patients in the area.  Conley added that the funding will also be used to purchase critical items and food for hospital workers earning wages at or below the  livability index  for Los Angeles County, a quantitative and qualitative tool that measures quality of life and satisfaction of residents in a given city.  Health care is meant to be a collaborative effort, with the patient front and center, supported by a team partnership of health care workers, who use their knowledge to reach the goals of the patient, Conley said. I believe that we have a truly beautiful opportunity to really engage and serve our greater community, before we are full-fledged physicians.  In developing LACV, Conley said she hoped to create a program that would engage individuals with their community, allowing them to realize the impact of this pandemic on different levels of society.  What we are trying to do is break down the institutional walls, build community based on the desire to serve, and have it be about the joint struggle we are engaged in, regardless of the letters behind your name, such as MD, DO, or NP, Conley said.  Paneno added that students of all capabilities, majors and schools are encouraged to join.  We are working in tandem with UCLA, but we are open to every school, and every group of students that is interested in helping in this crisis, Paneno said.",['cap-sarah-nelson'],"['campus', 'los-angeles', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.coronamed1.courtesy.jpg

The finalized set of rules, which will go into place in August, give more rights to those accused of sexual misconduct. The Department of Education first    released    the proposed rules in November 2018.    Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced she would begin reviewing Title IX laws, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded programs, in 2017 after claiming the current process does not give the accused due process.    The new rules define sexual harassment to include quid pro quo harassment by a school employee, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking.    In an effort to ensure due process for the accused, the rules require schools to offer equal rights of appeal for both parties of a Title IX inquiry.    Colleges are also required to hold live hearings that allow both victims and the accused to be cross-examined for credibility. Additionally, schools are only required to investigate complaints submitted through a formal process.    However, survivors do not have to come face to face with the accused or answer questions posed by the accused during the hearing.    The rules aim to protect those accused of sexual misconduct from being unjustly prosecuted, DeVos said in a press release.    ""Too many students have lost access to their education because their school inadequately responded when a student filed a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual assault,"" DeVos said.    The University of California Office of the President, UCLA and UCLA Title IX Office did not respond to immediate requests for comment.

Gavin Newsom granted Los Angeles County permission to reopen restaurants, barbershops and hair salons Friday.    Restaurants, barbershops and hair salons will now   be able to offer in-person services while following    social distancing guidelines    set by the county.    There are nearly 50,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in LA County and over 100,000 in California, according to the California state government    website   .    Newsom granted the county permission to partially reopen after the county submitted a    variance application    to the state to determine if they met the California Department of Public Healths guidelines to reopen.    The variance application is submitted by counties that want permission to reopen their economies while the stay-at-home orders are active.    LA County officials provided evidence in their application that their number of COVID-19 cases was low enough for the county to respond to an increase in cases if stay-at-home orders were loosened  ,   according to the Los Angeles Times.    The application showed less than 8% tested positive in LA County in the last seven days, thereby meeting the CDPHs guidelines.    The state required counties to prove their infection rate was low enough to reopen if they had less than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents over a two-week period or lower than 8% of people who tested positive for the virus in the last seven days.    The county stated in the application that 6.5% tested positive in the past week.    In the past four days, 8% of people tested had the coronavirus.    LA County had nearly 100 cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks.    The county also included its community mitigation plan   in their application, which estimates how the pandemic will affect the county in the upcoming months.    LA County joins over 40 other counties in California whose variance applications have been approved by the state, according to LA Times.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti directed the city&#8217;s homeless population of approximately 59,000 to move indoors in response to the  exponential  spread of the new coronavirus in LA County. The WRC was one of the first 13 temporary shelters open in the city.  The initiative came after California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all Californians to stay home and as the city scrambles to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. A total of  1,465 cases and 26 deaths  related to COVID-19 have been confirmed in LA County as of Friday.   New research  published by faculty from UCLA, Boston University and the University of Pennsylvania estimates that the pandemic could cause 400 deaths and hospitalize 2,600 people experiencing homelessness in LA County.  Given executive orders to practice social distancing and avoid gatherings of 10 or more people, the influx of homeless residents to recreation centers may seem counterintuitive. Some are concerned these temporary shelters could become &#8220;hotbeds&#8221; of COVID-19.  Street Watch LA, a homelessness advocacy organization, tweeted Saturday that the mayor&#8217;s shelter initiative for those experiencing homelessness could contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus.  &#8220;Crowding people in shelters doesn&#8217;t seem like a great idea,&#8221; said Rhiana Caterisano, a member of Street Watch LA. &#8220;It&#8217;s the opposite of what you want when you want to quarantine people.&#8221;  UCLA public health expert and professor of epidemiology Timothy Brewer said the shelters could allow health officials to isolate and contain those with the virus.  &#8220;On the upside, having individuals in a setting where you can rapidly identify and isolate them, as opposed to letting them be on the streets where they could become symptomatic and spread infection in the community, may reduce the risk of transmission,&#8221; Brewer said.  However, Brewer acknowledged that there is a risk-reward trade-off. He said asymptomatic individuals could still arrive at shelters and spread the virus.  Screening people for the disease and taking temperatures before they enter the centers would help mitigate potential dangers of being clustered in enclosed spaces, Brewer said.  The LA City Council passed a  motion  March 17 to use currently unoccupied city properties as emergency housing. It stipulated the beds be at least 6 feet apart and set out provisions for hygiene services.  The preambles of the motion stressed the urgency of sheltering people experiencing homelessness in light of closures of public facilities, where such people frequent to maintain hygiene.  The same motion called on Newsom to make hotel and motel rooms available for unhoused residents, a move homelessness advocates are lobbying for. The next day, Newsom signed an executive order that extended the state&#8217;s power to do just that.  Under California Government Code Section 8572, when a state of emergency is declared, the governor is given the authority to seize any private property for purposes related to the emergency. This includes commandeering hotels.  Newsom&#8217;s executive order handed over most control to the counties, which are now expected to identify and secure leases with available hotels and motels.  The LA County Emergency Operations Center is the office responsible for finding isolated medical sheltering facilities for COVID-19 patients, as well as for people experiencing homelessness.  It has so far secured two sites to house people that have tested positive for COVID-19 or are awaiting test results and either cannot stay at their homes or are experiencing homelessness, said Vanessa Martinez, a spokesperson for the LA CEOC, in an emailed statement. The two sites are Dockweiler RV Park in Playa Del Rey and the Sheraton Fairplex Hotel &amp; Conference Center in Pomona.

You&#8217;re going on the road on our second senior-day sellout, expecting to win, from two months ago when nobody would have expected you to have a chance.&#8221;  And less than a week after the loss to its crosstown rival, No. 2 seed UCLA men&#8217;s basketball (19-12, 12-6 Pac-12) will travel to Las Vegas for the Pac-12 tournament, facing off against No. 10 seed California (14-18, 7-11) on Thursday with a spot in the semifinals on the line.   A win against the Trojans would have marked the Bruins&#8217; eighth in a row &#8211; their 12th in 14 games &#8211; and potentially locked them into an NCAA tournament at-large bid. But as UCLA heads to Las Vegas, it will likely have to string together a few more wins to avoid settling for a National Invitation Tournament bid in the coming weeks.  UCLA&#8217;s NET ranking of No. 76 sits only above Utah, Washington State and California in the Pac-12, while ESPN&#8217;s Joe Lunardi still has the Bruins listed as &#8220;on the bubble&#8221; &#8211; indicating their NCAA tournament status is largely still in the air.  &#8220;We kind of forgot (how losing) felt,&#8221; said freshman guard/forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. &#8220;We got a taste of what it feels like to go on a hot streak, and losing is not something we take well to. It&#8217;s a good reminder, that&#8217;s not something we ever want to feel again.&#8221;  While Cronin&#8217;s players voiced their excitement to return to their previous winning ways, the first-year coach said the Bruins will need to clean up their offensive game plan if they are to prolong their stay in Sin City.  Against USC, UCLA shot just 28.6% from the field in the opening half and coughed up the ball nine times in the second half en route to its second-lowest offensive output all year.  &#8220;It was a low-scoring game,&#8221; Jaquez said. &#8220;When you have nine turnovers in a low-scoring game, it&#8217;s like a million.&#8221;  The Bruins' lowest-scoring game was their 50-40 victory over the Golden Bears on Jan. 19, the only time the two teams met this season.  After Saturday's loss to USC &#8211; which ended UCLA's chance for at least a share of the Pac-12 regular-season title &#8211; junior guard Chris Smith said the Bruins' first opponent in Las Vegas should be ready for a ""pummeling.""  Smith walked back those sentiments somewhat Tuesday but said he still believes in his team's ability to win games in the tournament.    &#8220;I was just really mad, I don&#8217;t like losing,&#8221; Smith said Tuesday. &#8220;I let my emotions get the best of me. I could feel the energy in the locker room, nobody was happy with the results we got. Everyone was pretty pissed off. After losing, you got to be mad, you have to be looking to figure out what you did wrong.&#8221;  And though Cronin said he had poked fun at Smith&#8217;s aggressive postgame comments, he did have one precaution for his leading scorer.  &#8220;We might want to leave that to (redshirt sophomore forward) Cody (Riley),&#8221; Cronin said. &#8220;You got to be able to bench press a certain amount to talk about pummeling anybody.&#8221;  Tipoff against Cal is set for 6 p.m. on Thursday.

At UCLA, our community is remarkably united by similar feelings of loss, confusion and concern, but also by light, hope and perspective that the pandemic has brought to the forefront. In Columns From Quarantine, Daily Bruin staffers and community submissions highlight the personal stories that mark this unprecedented moment. If you have a quarantine story to tell, you can submit it  here&nbsp; or email&nbsp; columnsfromquarantine@gmail.com      /   (Andrea Grigsby/Illustrations Director)  The last time I saw my boyfriend, we were sitting in his car. I gave him a valiant smile and told him I would see him soon. In our heads, we had not fully processed the extent of the pandemic; in our heads, our little world would be preserved. We were healthy, we were close and we were in love.  Its been a month since then.  When we first started getting serious, I was halfway across the world for winter break. We counted the days, impatient for when we could finally start our journey together. I would set alarms for 1 a.m. to talk to him when he woke up. He would send me songs that reminded him of me. Over those three weeks, we drafted plans for spring break: go to our favorite pizza restaurant, visit his childhood spots and destroy each other in Wii Sports. Little did we know, those plans would still have to wait.   ""We were healthy, we were close and we were in love."" The three-week experience over winter break taught us to be patient. However, when we were once again separated, it seemed especially unfair. My boyfriend and I are only 10 minutes away from each other, but those 10 minutes have turned into thousands of minutes before we can meet again.  We realized how much harder it was this time. It boiled down to two reasons: the pain in knowing how close we were, and the anxiety of not knowing how long it would be until pizza picnics and night drives began again. But the commitment to being safe, not just for us but for our loved ones, was what we both held tightly to.  Throughout the world, countless people are experiencing the same hardship, in which we can no longer show our love through closeness, but by walking away. In a truly perilous moment in our history, we are experiencing a threat to our human necessity to love openly. Whether its partners, friends or family, people express endearment by being there for one another. Now, we are stripped from that role, and loved ones have no choice but to view each others safety from a screen, in a social distancing-induced long-distance relationship.  In our case, that distance isnt very long  I am, in fact, approximately 1.8 miles away from him.  The feeling of being so close yet so separated has permeated the past month on lockdown  we often talk about the foggy Bay Area weather and how it felt driving through our empty neighborhoods. But that innate desire to just hop in the car and drive over crept into my mind on more than one occasion.  Some partners have succumbed to this desire. Being in the same shoes has shown me the difficulty of viciously blaming them. It has also shown me that staying apart can allow a partnership to flourish in new ways.  When I knew we would be apart again, part of me felt hopeless. But he reminded me of what we have nurtured since the day I took that 10-hour flight, and I realized that while feeling assured was hard, giving up would be harder.  There are moments when you are scared that the ice will crack. They will always be there in a relationship  global pandemic or not. A relationship will never be an easy, one-way street. I learned that the pain we feel now is necessary for our bond to grow.  When you are stuck in a situation like this with no choice, its a chance to show that you can make it. Its a perfect way to establish trust and demonstrate the dedication needed to not only keep things alive now, but blossoming for years to come.   ""I learned that the pain we feel now is necessary for our bond to grow.""   In the weeks since quarantine began, we found ways to accomplish this goal. Keeping the camera on, we did homework, watched movies, brushed our teeth and even took naps together. We let each other know how we were feeling every day and talked through those feelings. We explicitly expressed our dedication to working through this. We talked, talked, talked, until everything we said repeated.  Because that was what we needed.  [caption id=""attachment_378878"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]  (Courtesy of Cecile Wu)[/caption]  I was expecting an undoing, but what I really got was a blessing. I finally feel completely secure in a bond Ive created with someone, and that if we can get through this, we can work through any problem.  As I finish this up, I look over at him, temporarily living in the little box on my screen.  Yes, the horizon seems never-ending. We are tired of seeing the people we love in that little box. We are tired of hearing their words through grey bubbles. We are tired of waiting for when we can hold them again.  Regardless of how I get to see him, I will never be tired of loving him. For each person to find that commitment, I think, is all we need to get us through.  And in time, well all come out of our boxes and back into the world, together.

Since she won over the show's judges and viewers in her initial audition, the second-year global jazz studies student has blazed through the competition and was voted into the top-10 contestants this season. As the show &#8211; which now has contestants record their performances from home &#8211;   comes to a close, James said she hopes to continue with both songwriting and school in her budding career as a musician.  Amid her hectic filming schedule, James spoke with Daily Bruin's Jessica Li to reflect on her experiences on the show as a student and musician.   Daily Bruin:  How would you describe your journey to making it to the top 10?   Sophia James:  I surprised myself, because I realized that it pays off to be yourself and do your own thing. I was so touched with how much everyone rallied votes and was reaching out and sending me kind, beautiful messages of support.   [Related:    Student learns lessons of competition in process of auditioning for &#8216;American Idol&#8217;   ]    DB:  How has your performance style evolved since you first auditioned?   SJ:  I've done a lot of growing as an artist since I started ""American Idol."" I think I was still trying to figure out my lane. I learned along the way that I'm more of a singer-songwriter type artist than I thought. Ever since this process has started, it has compelled me to do a lot more songwriting and inner reflections of discovering who I am. It's helped me evolve and become more of an individual and develop more of an identifiable sound with my music.   DB:  What has your experience been like transitioning to an online format of ""American Idol?""   SJ:  It was definitely a huge transition going from the big lights and stage and the whole spectacle of it back into our homes and filming from home. They could have easily just said ""That's a wrap,"" and canceled the whole thing, but I'm really grateful that their production team was creative enough to find a way to continue the show from home. (""American Idol"") is the first to do anything like that, and to be just a puzzle piece in that history-making television was really cool.   DB:  What has it been like to perform from home?     SJ:  Some of my friends on the show have been saying it's more comfortable for them because that's where they grew up and learned music. There is an element of comfort to it, but I also feel a lot more vulnerable performing from home. When you're on stage, you have that safety net of a cheering crowd and lights and a live band and everything that's going on. Now, it's literally just us &#8211; take it or leave it. It's really a little bit daunting inviting all of America into our little home. But at the same time, I think it's a really beautiful experience knowing that everyone else is home and, hopefully, finding comfort in what we're doing.   [Related:    Spring Sing&#8217;s move online meant to maintain event&#8217;s original sense of community   ]    DB:  What have you learned from your experience, and how do you feel like you&#8217;ve grown as a person and a musician?   SJ:  Confidence has been a really big thing for me. I never really believed in myself. I always knew that I loved singing and loved music and wanted to pursue it, but I never allowed myself the validation of ""This is something that you can succeed at."" The whole process of (""American Idol"") has been really validating, especially hearing from the three judges that they want to continue to hear me sing. It's been a lesson of being confident in myself and believing that I can succeed in this business.   I tend to be really self-critical. I put myself down a lot, but hearing all these people that I respect telling me that they believe in me and all of these new supporters telling (me) that they believe in me is really eye-opening.   DB:  What are your short-term plans for the future after the show? Do you plan on continuing school or going into performing?    SJ:  I actually took a quarter off for spring quarter. I do plan on returning in the fall. I would love to complete my bachelor's degree, and I think education is one of the most important things in the world. I hope to simultaneously work on music and start gigging and performing.   More short-term, once (""American Idol"") ends, I plan on going full-throttle on songwriting, recording and releasing music. I have a lot of songs in my back pocket that I&#8217;ve never shared with the world, and (""American Idol"") has really given me the confidence to want to share my music.

After graduating with a degree in costume design and entrepreneurship in 2019, the alumna started her own clothing company, Simplicity Vintage, in September. After working in Los Angeles' fashion scene, she said she discovered how unsustainable the industry is  and she no longer wanted to contribute to the problem, prompting her to start her own business.

After being laid off from her job, Wallfish said she started selling colorful masks online. Initially, she only sold to friends and family, but as the demand for masks increased, Wallfish experienced a sudden growth in her companys popularity. But because of the financial hardships many people are facing, Wallfish said she wanted to ensure that her masks would be both practical and reasonably priced.  Affordability became a huge goal for me, Wallfish said. I wanted anyone to be able to buy one. I had a lot of friends and family tell me I was undercharging, but I really enjoyed the creative challenge of making masks at a manageable price.   [Related:    Graphic: Mask On, Keep Your Mask On   ]   Wallfish created her own website and also promotes her products through social media. In addition to selling her masks for $7.50 each, she said the order and delivery process has also been an obstacle to her small company. As of right now, she is unable to do any pick-ups, said Anne Schneider, a Simplicity Vintage costumer. Even though Wallfishs company is technically considered an essential business, she has been asked to deliver all orders and strictly adhere to social distancing practices.  Its hard because I do a lot of the sewing work in my garage, Wallfish said. People walk by and want to purchase masks right there on the spot. Its really difficult to have to turn them away.

(Kanishka Mehra/Assistant Photo editor)[/caption]  One of the reasons passersby are attracted to the masks is because they are covered in colorful prints and distinctive designs, ranging from fruits and vegetables to flowers and polka dots. Wallfish said her background in costume design has helped her produce masks that are both attractive and functional. The masks are made with 100% cotton and she offers two different styles: one with elastic around the ears and another that wraps around the head.  Along with the fit of the mask, Wallfish said the aesthetic is also very important. Combining cute prints with utility, she said, helps incentivize people to comply with the safety orders. She has also started selling matching scrunchies and headbands along with her masks, encouraging people to find creative ways to express themselves during quarantine.   [Related:    Student ties in comfort with personal brand in clothing line created in quarantine   ]   Shany Albalak, one of Wallfishs close friends, said she and her boyfriend bought coordinating masks: a watermelon and a lemon lime print. Albalak said the masks are vibrant and eccentric, unlike other ones shes seen. Most people are wearing medical masks or ones with solid colors, but Wallfishs fun designs add levity to the pandemic, she said.  This has been especially true for Schneider, she said. Her father is a first responder and has been personally impacted by Wallfishs masks.  This is a very intense time for us, Schneider said. Hes very involved with this crisis and has been making some tough decisions in the hospital. But on his way to and from the hospital, he wears the masks and always comments on how cute they are. They have really brightened his day, and it makes everything a little less depressing.

But at the moment, the means to do so aren't fitting the bill.  UCLA  Safe Ride  is a student service designed to provide safe and reliable transportation between campus,   on-campus housing and select nearby residential and urban areas. Existing pick-up locations span a region including Wilshire Boulevard, the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs and Hedrick Hall, as well as the North Village. And from these limited spots, rides can only be called from 7 p.m. until 12 a.m., Monday through Thursday.  Safe Ride vans are operated by Community Service Officers, or CSOs. The program is overseen by the UCLA Police Department and is partnered with UCLA Transportation, all with the goal of ensuring riders are kept safe with   rapid communication channels between drivers and the police force.  Certainly, the objective of the Safe Ride initiative is to   keep UCLA students safe. However, these good intentions arent worth their weight in accessibility and effectiveness. This program is a step in the right direction, but should further expand its services to best serve the student population.  If UCLA is going to spend time and money developing a student transportation service, it should be comprehensive. The university must reevaluate its transit systems and plan how to better protect students.   Safe Ride advertising strategies must   be improved   and   the hours, days and pick-up locations need to be extended   in order to best serve the student body.       And while the streets of Westwood lie dormant, UCLA has the perfect opportunity to do exactly this.  Because at the end of the day, student   safety should be one of UCLA's top priorities.  One of the biggest problems Safe Ride faces is   its lack of   publicity.   Many students have either never heard of or only vaguely remember what Safe Ride is, not to mention how to access its services.  For example, Bradley Whiteside, a third-year computer engineering student, said the service was only vaguely familiar.  I think I learned about (Safe Ride) during orientation, but Ive never used it, Whiteside said. I dont think Ive heard of any of my friends using it before either.  Likewise, Zev Marx-Kahn, a first-year environmental science student, said he tried to use the Safe Ride service once. However, it normally slips his mind.  A lot of times I forget that it exists, Marx-Kahn said. Sometimes, I just would not think of it as an option for getting somewhere.  And this is through   no fault of his own, or any other student left unaware.   New student   orientation is simply   not enough. UCLA should badger the student body with   information about important   safety measures like Safe Ride until it is ingrained in students' psyches.  UCLA can achieve this   through social media initiatives, collaborations with popular student organizations and, of course, traditional advertising   measures.    But   if UCLA promotes this service, it needs to be prepared to appropriately serve a large population every day.  Active a measly four nights a week and five hours a day, the standing Safe Ride program either fundamentally misunderstands the social habits of college students or lacks the capacity to be effective.  These deficiencies mean students must rely on companies they are more familiar with, such as Uber and Lyft, to travel to and from campus.   In December,  Uber  revealed that in 2018 there were 3,000 reports of sexual assault on rides in the United States. Similarly,  Lyft , which some consider to be the safer alternative to Uber, is facing dozens of lawsuits accusing the company of weak background checks and not doing enough to protect passengers.  Across town,  USC  has made student transit security a top priority  and by doing so, puts UCLA and its insufficient safety initiatives to a shame.  The closest program to Safe Ride on their campus is called Campus Cruiser. It is operated by students and is designed to function similarly to rideshare apps like Uber and Lyft. However, it is functional all week, well   into the early morning   hours.  Mahin Tahsin, a fourth-year business administration and economics student and the former USC Undergraduate Student Government vice president, said that in addition to Campus Cruiser, students have access to free Lyfts within a certain radius of campus. And as a result of student safety advocacy, availability ebbs and flows with daylight savings.  The hours were changed to match when the sun goes down, Tahsin said. It is a program for student safety and theoretically more dangerous situations would happen when it is dark outside.  Sabrile McGinn, a third-year business administration student at USC, said everyone she knows uses the service.   "" You can go to any bar, any house, any party thats close to campus and you have a free, safe ride,"" McGinn said. ""I've literally never heard anyone say anything bad about it.""  It's evident that UCLA's safety measures pale in comparison to this ingenuity and accessibility.   While it's disappointing when the Bruins   don't beat the Trojans in sports, it is humiliating to fall behind   in security.  It is important to note that the financial structures and demand for advanced security measures sharply differ between UCLA and USC.  At UCLA, funds for transportation services like Ride Share are limited. But as many students would certainly agree, this is a program worth a greater cost. UCLAs Safe Ride should, at the bare minimum, work to achieve the same daily operating schedule available at USC.  Some may argue that for-profit rideshare apps like Uber and Lyft may be the easy and cheap alternative to costly renovations. However, that isnt necessarily the case.

Those who have personal items in a locker in the John Wooden Center, Sunset Canyon Recreation Center, North Pool, Student Activities Center and Kinross Recreation Center can collect their belongings Monday and Tuesday from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m., 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 5 to 7 p.m.    Lockers will not be cleared and belongings will remain secure for those who cannot immediately retrieve their belongings.    The email did not state what the current status of student memberships or program registration is. However, McMahan said UCLA Recreation appreciates students patience while the department develops the resources to process the membership and registration   requests.    UCLA announced Friday it will move all classes online wherever possible through spring quarter. Since then, other campus entities and programs have shut down, including athletic team practices, the Hammer Museum and the Fowler Museum.    However, the campus itself remains open, including on-campus housing and facilities such as restaurants, stores and libraries.    There still have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at UCLA.

The San Diego campus is considering ending the 10-week quarter system, according to UCSD spokesperson Christine Clark. UCSD and six other UCs have been using the quarter system since 1966.  UC Berkeley and UC Merced are the only two UC campuses that have already been using the semester system in an attempt to improve the student experience. UC Berkeley transitioned to the semester system in 1983, and UC Merced began with the semester system since the campus was founded in 2005.  Charles Nies, vice chancellor of student affairs at UC Merced, said the campus decided to use the semester system because it thought it was important for students to have a longer period of time in their classes, especially for students running science experiments.  &#8220;When the campus was being developed, it wanted to focus on a structured experience and get learning outcomes for science and engineering, particularly with lab research,&#8221; Nies said. &#8220;The school looked at the advantage of a longer experience to create lab work.&#8221;  Nies said there were also economic benefits involved in the decision to implement a semester system, as the school only opens and closes twice instead of three times.  UCLA Chancellor Gene Block supported  switching to the semester system  at a meeting with the Daily Bruin Editorial Board in March 2019.  &#8220;The quarter system, in my view, is a failed system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most schools have moved away from it, and it&#8217;s really mostly a West Coast phenomenon now.&#8221;  Students at UCLA have also voiced their support for the semester system because of mental health and academic performance benefits.  The semester system could address student concerns about mental health, said Robert Watson, Undergraduate Students Association Council president and fourth-year political science student.  &#8220;When I think of the possibility of switching to a semester system, I think a lot about mental health concerns and the wellness of students on campus,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;Obviously, the quarter system is pretty stressful for everyone. It&#8217;s quick-paced tests on a very frequent basis.&#8221;  An additional benefit to the semester system is that it gives students time to recover from a poor grade earlier in the semester, Nies added.   &#8220;In the semester system, midterm grades are not binding,&#8221; Nies said. &#8220;They give an early alert to students who have enough time to recover. You can&#8217;t do this on a quarter system.&#8221;  While there are potential benefits to switching over to the semester system, UCSD has not finalized its decision.  Campus leadership has already had preliminary discussions about transitioning to the semester system, but no decision has been made yet, Clark said in an emailed statement.  Clark added that a semester system may be more advantageous for students because of better alignment with the timing of summer internships, which would allow students to begin working earlier.  The semester system would also make transferring courses from the California Community Colleges system to higher education institutions easier and keep classes at a more measured pace to reduce stress on students, Clark said in the statement.  Changing to the semester system will require time and approval by the UC Academic Senate and the UC Regents, she added.  While support for the semester system may seem popular among some students, others prefer learning with the current quarter system.  Hanna Schulte, a second-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student, said she enjoys the quarter system because it allows students to take a wider variety of classes.   &#8220;I think it provides an opportunity to take more classes, and if you end up not liking a class, then it&#8217;s over in 10 weeks,&#8221; Schulte said.  In any case, a UCLA transition to the semester system will most likely need a large amount of time and cooperation among UCLA faculty, Watson said.  &#8220;We all acknowledge that it would be a multiyear, costly process for the university and ultimately we have to get our faculty and professors on board as well,&#8221; Watson said.

Prosecutors will recommend the lower end of penalties for racketeering, which can result in up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. The plea deal, which Salcedo signed Sunday, will dismiss all other charges against Salcedo, including conspiring to commit bribery, mail fraud and wire fraud.    Salcedo will have to forfeit $200,000 as part of the plea, the amount of money he took from multiple families attempting to secure their childrens admission to UCLA. Both families accused of paying Salcedo and consultant Rick Singer for fabricating their childrens soccer profiles and arranging admission to the university have already pleaded guilty to separate criminal charges.    Xiaoning Sui, who paid Singers company $400,000 to recruit her son into UCLAs mens soccer program, pleaded guilty to federal program bribery in February. Bruce and Davina Isackson, who paid $250,000 for their daughters admission, pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering charges in May 2019 and are cooperating with prosecutors.    The former mens soccer coach received $100,000 from each familys payment, according to court documents.    Salcedo joins the dozens of parents, coaches and administrators who have already pleaded guilty or been sentenced for their involvement in the scandal since March 2019.

Even before the number of cases in the U.S. exploded in March, the coronavirus had already been wreaking devastation around the world since its discovery in December.  But as Americans realized where they lived was no longer a safe haven from the outbreak, public opinion, including that of students, converged to a state of uncertainty and concern.  The Daily Bruin took a look back at how students views changed in the past three weeks and the forces that shaped them.   A New Reality   About three weeks ago on March 11, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic.  A few hours later, Tom Hanks announced that he and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive for the virus while in Australia. The NBA suspended the 2020 season a half-hour later after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive, followed by his teammate Donovan Mitchell. A tweet from a Los Angeles Times reporter went viral.    what a year this last half hour has been   Matt Pearce  (@mattdpearce)  March 12, 2020       And that same day, UCLA began its first day of completely remote instruction, initially planned until April 10. It was the start of a period during which the campus shut down , spring classes went completely online , study abroad programs were canceled and commencement was thrown into chaos .  Students did not know what to expect. Some thought the school was taking it too far. Others thought UCLA should have acted faster.  Either way, they all faced a single dilemma: Should I stay or should I go home?  On March 15, Dayshawn Louden, a fourth-year African American Studies student, was shopping for groceries at Target with Fiona Wong, a second-year undeclared student, as they normally did.  Im not as freaked out, Louden said on March 15. I wash my hands daily. I carry a bottle of hand sanitizer, just do everything normally.  Wong said she and Louden thought social media was at fault for creating mass hysteria.  They're just not showing how high the recovery rates are. Instead, they're showing the bad parts, Wong said. Oh, it's spreading here, its spreading there. Yes, it's going to spread but it's not like you're going to get it immediately.  Louden said he recognized the dangers of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. But he said he was most concerned about the xenophobic language President Donald Trump used in his press conferences. Trump had repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the Chinese virus and a foreign virus.  Because we are in America, often things become racialized, Louden said. I don't want the face of the coronavirus to be like some Asian dude in a mask.  Despite his skepticism, Louden planned to return home to Carson, California. Remote instruction made staying on campus a meaningless expense, he said.  It would still be safe to stay on campus considering how many people are moving out, Wong said. She was only going back to the Bay Area because of a family emergency unrelated to the coronavirus.  Id rather be here, Wong said. What they're saying is just avoid mass crowds. ... I guess they're just trying to contain it. Theres nothing wrong containing it, but I think freaking out over it and overstocking is not very (helpful).  About two hours after Louden and Wong spoke to the Daily Bruin, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti started shutting the city down to contain the pandemic, ordering restaurants and bars to close or stop offering dine-in service.  Carol Lin, on the other hand, had been monitoring the spread of the pandemic back at home in Atlanta, as well as in Los Angeles. Lin feared as the pandemic progresses, UCLA might put in place a campuswide quarantine before she could fly home.  Its inevitable, said Lin, a second-year business economics student, on March 12. The spread of the coronavirus to the UCLA campus is ultimately going to happen.  Lin said the university should have notified students earlier of its decision to cancel classes. Fulton County, which includes Atlanta and is the most populous county in the state, announced the closure all of its public schools March 9 after a middle school teacher tested positive for the virus.  They probably already had to make the decision to go online at least a few days before the actual announcement, Lin said. Letting students know and have that peace of mind is better than what they did, which was (waiting) until the day before to tell us.  [caption id=""attachment_377795"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""620""]  Travelers wait in a line to check in at the Los Angeles International Airport on March 16. Air traffic at LAX significantly dropped following the spread of COVID-19. (Jintak Han/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Lin flew home March 19, hours before Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered Californians to stay at home . She had decided the benefits of flying home and taking classes remotely outweighed the risks of traveling during a developing global pandemic, even as airport personnel began testing positive for the coronavirus.  Moving classes online is one step, but if the virus is still spreading after spring break, I don't want to be stuck here, Lin said. Either way I'm gonna be stuck somewhere so it might as well be at home. And especially right now it's not as bad as it's going to be.  For others, the universitys response to the spreading coronavirus, not the pandemic itself, was the final straw.  Zoe Igarashi, a third-year exchange student from Waseda University in Japan, visited UCLA to study international development. But once UCLA moved instruction online until April 10, Igarashi saw no purpose in staying in the United States any further.  The reason I wanted to study abroad is to communicate with friends here and make real conversation with Americans, Igarashi said on March 15. And also to be more active. If theres no physicalness, theres no point.  Igarashi decided to end her exchange program a quarter early and booked a flight back to Tokyo for March 19.  I know that the staff at LAX tested positive, so thats kind of scary, Igarashi said. My mom told me not to take off (my) mask during the entire fight. I'll try to do that.   Coming to Terms   Two weeks later, the world hardly looks like the same place.  The 2020 Olympics were moved to 2021. The United States overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus cases. Gov. Gavin Newsom put California under a statewide ""stay at home"" order. A drive-thru testing center occupied a Jackie Robinson Stadium parking lot usually filled with UCLA baseball fans.     [caption id=""attachment_377796"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""620""]  A woman returns a coronavirus test kit at a drive-thru testing facility next to Jackie Robinson Stadium. (Jintak Han/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  The number of reported cases of COVID-19 at UCLA has now grown to seven, after its first reported case March 16. Chancellor Gene Block moved commencement ceremonies online, then reversed the decision and apologized following student outcry.  And Lin, Igarashi, Louden and Wong were all under self-quarantine after returning home from Los Angeles.  My backpack, the one that I brought on the plane, I left it in the garage because I'm very scared, said Lin on March 23 from her room in Atlanta. I don't want to bring any virus inside.  Once Lin had gotten home on March 19, she said her doctor recommended she immediately isolate herself in her room.  Luckily I have access to my TV, Lin said. But like for the most part, I'm in my room. And if I do want to go out there a little bit, like in my house, I have to wear a mask. I try not to sit down on anything.  Lin said she was glad she was home, although she said she was a bit concerned about taking classes over a three-hour time difference.  When Igarashi flew home to Japan on March 19, the Japanese government only recommended she quarantine herself in a hotel or isolate at home.  My friend was thinking to stay in a hotel because she couldn't go back home, Igarashi said on March 23. (But she said) if the hotel site knows that you're (one of the) people who came back from abroad, they won't be able to take your booking ... because (its) kind of risky.  Quarantines became mandatory in Japan on March 23. Luckily, Igarashi said, Waseda University starts remote instruction for the upcoming semester after April 20.  My parents, they definitely wanted me to (be) back home, Igarashi said. It's the safest place, you know?  Annette Regan, an adjunct assistant professor of epidemiology at UCLA, specializes in respiratory and infectious diseases. Regan said although cultural differences limit any comparison of containment strategies between countries, social distancing is the best way to counter the spread of the coronavirus.  It's really, really hard to completely control respiratory viruses, Regan said. In the absence of having an effective vaccine, really our best control measure is this social distancing. ... What it's really trying to do is make it so that the virus spreads more slowly for the community.  Igarashi said she was worried for her friends in Japan, who were holding large gatherings without any social distancing.  I feel like they are not that worried about (COVID-19), Igarashi said.  Louden and Wong packed up to leave Westwood on March 25. Louden was going back to Carson and Wong was waiting for a friend to drive her up to San Francisco.  Honestly, I don't want to leave, Wong said. I feel like college is where I want to be.  The continuing flood of concern about coronavirus on social media didnt frighten Wong any further. Shes just tired of reading about it, she said.  I definitely think it's getting more serious, Wong said. I don't think it's ever been not serious.  Regan said although the ""stay at home"" measures are crucial to containing the coronavirus, they may have exacerbated the publics dependence on social media.  We have the ability to create this panic spiral where it gets communicated constantly through our lives while we're stuck at home, in the news, and then we all communicate it through different channels, through Facebook, through Twitter, through Snapchat, Regan said. And then it just constantly becomes all-consuming and it creates this panic and anxiety.  Instead, Regan said the press has a duty to keep the public informed, including about those who have died from the virus, but it should do so without inciting panic.  We had our first death under 18 in LA this week, Regan said. We've seen a couple cases (of) people in their 20s that were in the hospital with COVID. And I think sharing stories like that are important to show that it's not just older adults that are going to be impacted by the virus.  Louden said he viewed the pandemic more seriously after learning about 80% of people in California who tested positive for the coronavirus  which he thought mainly affected the elderly  were under the age of 65.  Oh, wow, Louden said. That's staggering.  Both Louden and Wong quarantined themselves in their rooms after returning home.",['cap-jhan'],"['a-closer-look', 'campus', 'international', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.news_.changingperspectives.file_-1.jpg

But for Anay Mehta, that means taking a computer science midterm at 5 a.m.  Mehta, a first-year mechanical engineering student, lives in Dubai. All of his classes occur between 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. GST, which is 11 hours ahead of PST. Mehta plans to attend three of his four classes in real time, with the exception of a 3 a.m. computer science lecture, to avoid falling behind.  &#8220;It just wouldn't be healthy to stay up for that class,&#8221; Mehta said. &#8220;There's just no way. I would completely screw my mental health.&#8221;  On March 13, UCLA moved all classes online for spring quarter. It also encouraged UCLA students to go home; by March 24, 80% of the students living on the Hill had moved out.  However, in the 2018-2019 school year, 12% of undergraduate students and 26% of graduate students at UCLA are international students and those that returned home face a new problem: time zones.  Many professors across departments have opted to record lectures to let international students attend class at better times. However, some have not.  Jin Lee, a second-year geography/environmental studies student, had to drop a class that only held live Zoom lectures in the middle of the night on Malaysia Time.  Since the lecture slides posted on CCLE only contained outlines of information, Lee would have had to catch up by purchasing and reading a $120 textbook.  Some professors, especially those teaching performance-based classes, face higher barriers to making their classes accessible to students of all time zones.  Communication 1: &#8220;Principles of Oral Communication&#8221; requires students give four speeches to their classmates over the course of the quarter. Lecturer Karen Mack has committed to accommodating students who cannot give speeches over Zoom by allowing submission of videos in place of live presentations.   However, those who opt out of live presentations lose the benefit of immediate peer and instructor feedback, she said. Although Mack has a number of students taking her course from the eastern hemisphere, each of these students has expressed their willingness to attend class and present speeches in real time.  &#8220;We're going to try and retain as much of the original spirit and feeling of the course as possible with the understanding that it may be difficult this quarter,&#8221; Mack said.  Tiara Thompson, a teaching assistant for Theater 20: &#8220;Acting Fundamentals,&#8221; another performance-based class, does not plan to record her classes. The group environment is integral, she said.  The course, which is typically collaborative, has had to be restructured to incorporate more individual work as a result of the challenges presented by laggy and faulty audio, Thompson added.  Even some professors who are making accommodations for students who cannot attend lectures have not been able to adjust exam times.  For Mehta, this means taking that 5 a.m. midterm.  &#8220;Nobody's writing a final or a midterm at 5 a.m. in the right state of mind,&#8221; Mehta said. &#8220;Definitely not when you had lecture the same night, or morning, rather.&#8221;  Freshman pre-business economics student, Mihnea Tatu-Chitoiu will also have to take what was meant to be three 6 p.m. exams at 4 a.m. instead. Tatu-Chitoiu lives in Romania, which is 10 hours ahead of PST.  &#8220;That's really not something you're happy to hear, but at the same time, I would say that ... I really love what I'm studying, so I'm gonna make this effort to stay awake until 4 a.m.,&#8221; Tatu-Chitoiu said.  In addition to detaching students from their courses, time zone discrepancies mean international students have a harder time connecting with their friends and peers to collaborate.  As about 70% of the UCLA student population were California residents in the 2018-2019 school year, international students will inevitably have friends with drastically contrasting schedules, Mehta said.  &#8220;I have to stay up past 2 a.m. after my lectures to work on homework with my friends ... otherwise, I'm essentially expecting them to be awake, doing homework with me when it is 11 p.m. (in California) at the earliest, and that's assuming I get out of bed and immediately start doing math without eating breakfast,&#8221; Mehta said.  To help confused students, some professors have reached out personally to provide reassurance.  Lee said her English instructor sent an email prior to week one inquiring about students&#8217; time zones and various difficulties imposed by the closure of campus. The professor ensured that Lee would be paired with peers in compatible time zones for any group projects.  Furthermore, the professor understood that Lee would not be able to attend or participate in class and set up appointments, aside from those that are normally scheduled, to guarantee her the opportunity to ask questions.  &#8220;She's going way above and beyond for international students, which I really appreciate,&#8221; she said.  Some professors have also increased the flexibility of deadlines, allotting 24 hours to complete exams, and connecting students with teaching assistants who share similar time zones to alleviate complications.  Despite extensive efforts by some professors to create an equitable experience for students outside the PST region, certain issues remain unsolvable by nature.  The school system in Romania doesn&#8217;t use much technology, Tatu-Chitoiu said, so he doesn&#8217;t have much experience using computers for education. He added that he is concerned he will not have access to assistance from instructors or other UCLA services when encountering struggles with online learning platforms.  Most of the time he and others in different time zones will be sending emails when those who can provide help are asleep, he said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not anyone&#8217;s fault, it&#8217;s just the way it goes,&#8221; Tatu-Chitoiu said.  Regardless of the frustrations induced by learning in different time zones, many students have expressed their sympathy for professors.  &#8220;(The circumstances) are absolutely god awful, but the professors themselves are doing the best they can,&#8221; Mehta said. &#8220;It's not like the situation is the way it is for lack of effort on anyone's part.&#8221; ",['cap-megan-mccallister'],"['a-closer-look', 'international', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/ILLO.png

For the first time in program history, UCLA women's basketball has a recruiting class made entirely up of international prospects. Forward Izzy Anstey is from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, guard Gemma Potter is from Warrandyte, Victoria, Australia, and forward Emily Bessoir is from Munich, Germany.  Bessoir was the first of the three to commit on June 14. The German native put up 7.7 points and 9.3 rebounds during the FIBA U19 Women's Basketball World Cup 2019 in Bangkok, Thailand  where all three recruits were on display and where UCLA coach Cori Close coached for Team USA.  After the summer games, Bessoir played the 2019-2020 season on TS Jahn Mnchen in the 2nd Bundesliga South, Germanys second womens league. She averaged 17.9 points, 12.3 rebounds and 2.1 steals in 31 minutes per game over the course of the season.  Close said Bessoir's 6-foot-4 frame coupled with her shooting ability  shown in her 32% from beyond the arc last year  make her an elite offensive threat.  (Bessoir) can play the three, four or the five  she's versatile, Close said. She is a great shooter. It starts with her ability to score off the catch and she can play both inside and outside as well as attack off the bounce.  Anstey  the daughter of former NBA player Chris Anstey  averaged 7.9 points and 8.1 rebounds in the U19 Women's Basketball World Cup in 2019 while representing Australia.  With the departure of senior forward Ally Rosenblum, both Bessoir and Anstey will come in as the tallest players on the team at 6-foot-4. Close said their addition to the team will fill help fill an area in which the Bruins are lacking.  That was a major priority for us  having those two come in is huge, Close said.""(Size) was a major weakness of ours and a major hole that we were able to fill with (Bessoir) and (Anstey).  The Bruins also lost two guards in the offseason after redshirt senior Japreece Dean was drafted to the WNBA and freshman Jaden Owens transferred to Baylor.  Potter  who averaged 2.1 points during a championship season with the Canberra Capitals of the Women's National Basketball League in Australia  will be the only guard Close can add to her rotation next year. She will join a roster that still boasts eight guards, despite the two departures.  Close said Potters value is on the defensive end, where she will help shoulder the perimeter defensive role with current freshman guard Charisma Osborne.  (Potter) really takes a lot of pride in being a lockup defender, and I'm really excited about that, Close said. That was really shouldered by (Osborne) on the perimeter this year and (Potter) can do that in a (6-foot) body. She's also a good slasher to the basket, but I like her athleticism and her toughness above all else.  UCLA currently has two international players on its roster in junior guard Chantel Horvat and freshman forward Brynn Masikewich, who hail from Australia and Canada, respectively.

With social distancing measures  forbidding  large gatherings,   studio   audiences quickly diminished down to only the shows&#8217; staff members or no audience at all. Back in March, former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg guest  hosted  ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" to a spread-out audience of Kimmel staffers, friends and his husband. That same night, ""The Daily Show"" host Trevor Noah  sang  a goodbye tribute to his studio audience. The landscape of late-night was changing rapidly, but many of these shows persisted where they could, bringing humor to the United States during a time when it needed them most.  And because the ascending severity of the pandemic forced much of the United States to stay at home, a sudden and hastily concocted transition into the digital realm began for late-night shows whose core identities lived within studio walls and live audiences.    [Related:    Second Take: TikTok is savagely redefining rap music&#8217;s cultural significance ]   Thankfully though, most late-night shows haven&#8217;t seemed to miss a beat   during this early transition period as hosts adjusted to recording their shows at home, often with only their show producers serving as their audiences over Zoom. In fact, the new digital realm has   forced many of these shows to fervently dig deep into their creative pockets in order to keep their output fresh and exciting within this looser format  . For example, the final sketch of the 45th season of NBC's ""Saturday Night Live,"" titled  ""Dreams,""  features liberal use of green screens to depict cast members' humorous but poignant dream scenarios of what they miss the most about life in New York City before the pandemic started.  And while these unfortunate times have put a hold on   Hollywood, it&#8217;s wholeheartedly admirable that late-night comedy shows have adapted to these new spaces to continue providing the U.S. with some much-needed laughs.  As easy as it may seem for a late-night host to set a camera down on a table, hit record and start monologuing &#8211; it&#8217;s not. The loss of a live studio audience could have proved detrimental for many of these hosts who have spent prior years feeding off crowd energy on the stand-up stage. Conversely,   SHOWTIME hosts Desus Nice and The Kid Mero have found their comedic energy over the years through the immediate feedback of riffing off each other in person, which now has to be replicated over Zoom   with minor lag.  But even despite the mountains of technical difficulties, the makeshift aesthetic of these shows&#8217; early quarantine efforts will always highlight a sincere desire on their end to make things work. Jimmy Fallon&#8217;s wife Nancy serves as the camerawoman for his ""At Home Edition"" monologues, Stephen Colbert did his first at-home monologue in his bathtub and Kimmel recorded his monologues directly from his phone before he was able to start using a proper green screen setup. The early transition period for these shows could have resulted in disastrous, disjointed messes, but late-night hosts made use of what &#8211; and who &#8211;   they could.  Concurrently, such makeshift efforts have fueled a heightened sense of homeliness and togetherness for audiences. Hosts and guests are typically seen in proper suits and fancy dresses with studio lights blaring upon them, but audiences are instead getting peeks into their home lives as they &#8211; and their A-list celebrity guests &#8211; share what they've been doing with their families to pass the time at home in quarantine.   [Related:    Second Take: Quibi bites off more than it can chew in attempt to make streaming more accessible   ]   In that same vein, quarantine has forced many of these late-night shows to explore new avenues of creativity that otherwise would have never been discovered.   ""DESUS &amp; MERO"" aired a  fully animated  interview with writer Malcolm Gladwell along with a Zoom  cookalong  with The New York Times food columnist Alison Roman &#8211; both which were efforts cultivated from the circumstances presented by the pandemic.  Similarly,   ""Saturday Night Live""   completely revamped its structure and reneged on many of its long-standing traditions in order to produce three at-home shows between April and May. The shows were filmed beforehand, and the cast's inability to perform inside Studio 8H has stretched the show&#8217;s creative limits to take on more of an amateur ""early YouTube sketch comedy-style"" approach.  New cast member Chloe Fineman &#8211;   who had a standard-fare first year on SNL with limited opportunities to perform   &#8211; was able to stand out in the at-home format by filming solo sketches focused entirely on her   impersonations. She produced parody MasterClass  sketches  featuring comical  impersonations  of actor Timoth&#233;e Chalamet and screenwriter Phoebe Waller-Bridge, among others &#8211; all of which found a spotlight in SNL's at-home format.  Even with this new transition, ""Saturday Night Live"" proved it is still the cultural touchstone it has been for more than 40 years. The show&#8217;s   comedic portrayal of life in quarantine   &#8211; along with Michael Che's and Colin Jost's pointed commentary on coronavirus-related news during its ""Weekend Update"" segments &#8211;  highlighted   a strong understanding of the public consciousness and zeitgeist even amid a global pandemic  .  While it could be argued that these late-night comedy shows haven&#8217;t been the same as their traditional studio counterparts   &#8211;   and are therefore less enjoyable &#8211; it would be irrational to discredit them for a lack of effort.    It's impossible to recreate a one to one copy of each show&#8217;s respective formats, but they are all trying, despite the technical hiccups. The balance these shows have found in sticking to their traditional structures while expanding the creative limits that the digital realm can offer has ultimately made for innovative, gut-busting and fascinating television in the coronavirus era.  The collective work of late-night shows proves that comedy will ultimately have its healing effect on a distressed, pandemic-stricken country &#8211; no matter what, where, when or how it's produced.

The Editorial Board does not have any Black members. In fact,    our newsroom    has historically been and continues to be largely devoid of Black student journalists.   We recognize that this lack of inclusion is an unacceptable disservice to the UCLA community, and for this we apologize.    The long process as we attempt to remedy our own lack of inclusivity and diversity, however, is no excuse for silence on our part in the present.    We recognize that these protests are not only the result of Floyds death, but the result of ongoing institutional racism and generations of police brutality and racially motivated killings that took the lives of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Philando Castile, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland. The list goes on, even though it should not.    Rather than speak on these pertinent national issues with a glaring lack of Black voices, the Board asks that our readers reflect on the work and guidance from the    Afrikan Student Union    in the following Q&amp;A.    We thank ASU for their time and energy and hope the UCLA community finds value in this dialogue.    ---------------    The following is a lightly edited Q&amp;A between representatives from the Afrikan Student Union and Daily Bruin Editorial Board. ASU is represented by its current chairperson, Alexandria Davis, and its incoming co-chairperson, Alexander Dunkwu. The 2020-2021 Daily Bruin Editorial Board is represented by editor in chief Melissa Morris, managing editor Lucy Carroll, opinion editor EJ Panaligan and outreach director Marilyn Chavez-Martinez.    EDITORIAL BOARD:   What have your experiences been like as leaders of the Afrikan Student Union during this time?    DUNKWU:   I think it's just been in our communities, a lot of exhaustion. As students its a trifecta and we're getting hit from every angle of our identity. I just think there's just a lot of exhaustion in our community specifically, starting with regards to schools, and if you look on the news, all you see is these protests that are nationwide in response to the death of George Floyd. And so I think its just a lot of exhaustion, I would say. I would say, just fed up, I feel like.    DAVIS:   For me it's a lot of exhaustion, frustration, lack of positivity, lack of being able to see positives gain, positive things gaining. On one hand, I'm proud to see Black folks organizing, I'm proud to see non-Black allies organizing as well, but I do wish we were organizing for not another murder of Black life at the hands of police. It's been frustrating, being a leader because I wish I could just  sometimes I wish I could just prioritize my emotions and my mental health being a Black person, but I also have to be considerate of the student population that we engage with and uphold and how they are as well   and making sure our voices are   heard.    It's difficult managing being an advocate while at the same time being a student. Being a student leader is the perfect phrasing of that just because we say being a student comes first, but a lot of times that leader role has to come first. It's really been hard, especially that it's finals  especially that police brutality has been consistent, for most of my life. So it's really hard to see positivity. And it's been hard to come together around these issues too because there's been some division in the community in talking about protesting and looting and understanding those things too. But I do think it's a point in time where people can really engage (and) educate themselves and some people are taking on that cause and other people are not.    EB:   How do you feel about UCLA and UCPDs response to the national and local news and unrest?    DAVIS:   Has there been a response?    EB:   Or lack thereof.    DAVIS:   There was that email that (Chancellor) Gene Block sent, and then that tweet that (Block) sent saying Black Lives Matter. I do think the response has been rather lackluster. I think it's very face value, surface level, and there's a lot of depth to what's going on and we need to deal with that. (Block) will say, Black Lives Matter, while simultaneously telling us that there's no real space for a Black resource center on campus and I feel like those things are connected because they impact Black life. So I think there could have been a better job of a response. I also think theres been a lack of understanding on how to proceed during this time with finals. We're trying to figure out how that is and we put together a petition regarding that and are waiting to hear a response from the Academic Senate to figure out what finals are going to be like. But I think it's been rather lackluster, very surface level.    DUNKWU:   Yeah, I just think its very hypocritical, I would say. For one, in the email that was sent, you have the head of UCPD signing the email. Just the police thing in their entirety just is something anti-Black. You can't be hearing me say Black Lives Matter and have this institution that is the cause of this, cosign that. So I feel like thats a little hypocritical. I've seen (Block)s tweet, saying Black Lives Matter and stuff like that. Its hypocritical again, because you have Bunchy Carter and John Huggins, who were two Black UCLA students that were murdered on this campus and they were not given any recognition by the university. The only recognition they were given was by students or faculty. So it's just, its a little hypocritical to say that Black lives do matter at UCLA when (its) history, the universitys history that it has failed to correct, shows that thats not true.    DAVIS:   Yeah, keeping those things in mind, just responding that way, like (Dunkwu) said, is very hypocritical. Theres so much more to be done, and theres so much that hasnt been done.    DUNKWU:   Also, to say that youve been meeting with UCLA, specifically, youre talking about admin. Because weve tried to reach out, and its very  its not ill-intentioned  it just doesnt seem to get anywhere.    DAVIS:   Right, and they said that theyve been reaching out to leaders and stuff like that, but wheres your reaching out to the Black community or either reaching out to the Afrikan Student Union to have a conversation with the Black community that hasnt happened at all. And its not very likely to happen.    EB:   To jump back to something that you were just talking about: Can you tell us more about the petition that youve been circulating calling on UCLA to adjust finals?    DAVIS:   Yeah, so the petition came out of the understanding that mental health isnt normally prioritized on this campus, but it was prioritizing Black mental health and its the result of the work of my successors, Simone (Walker) and (Dunkwu). But, I would say that Simone did a lot of work to advocate and put this out.    DAVIS:   I don't know how many signatures it's gotten, but we just used the petition to allow people to express their grievances, and not only students  community members, alumni, whoever wanted to engage and express why or how this is affecting folks, how these times are affecting folks and their ability to complete normal tasks or their ability to complete assignments as large as finals. On Sunday night I know we reached 10,000 responses, and I know it's more than that at this point. I did send those responses as well as a letter to the Academic Senate demanding that finals either be postponed or at least transitioned into low stakes assignments for students.    DUNKWU:   I feel like UCLA also prides itself on accessibility in regards to its education, and education right now as a Black student I feel is a bit inaccessible.   We are in the middle of a pandemic. You literally turn the TV on and you see, yet again, there's another murder of somebody who looks just like us, and this time it was a trifecta.   So I think it's a little hard for a Black student who has to juggle everything else, while also thinking about finals  . I think it's inconsiderate as well for professors, departments, the entire institution to act like it's not that big of an issue to our community    EB:   What advice, if any, do you have for students who want to show their support for anti-police brutality and Black Lives Matter causes, but arent sure how?    D  UNKWU  :   I would say, avoid performative allyship. I know theres been a lot of things like Black Lives Matter chains, and although awareness is key, I feel like there's a way to move in respect to the community that's going through this. So just reaching out to somebody whos Black, asking, How can I support you,"" How are you  things like that. Just being there for people, I feel, and also the idea of awareness and avoiding performative allyship.    DAVIS:   Yes, I agree completely with what (Dunkwu) said. Avoid performative allyship, inform yourself of what actually is going on, and the history of police brutality  but also the history of what the police are and where they come from, which is rooted in slavery. I think it's important not to depend on information that you're receiving by asking your Black friends  so not depending on them to educate you, but rather you educating yourself.      And   I understand some allies to the community have felt the need to take it upon themselves to engage in action  or they're so angry and frustrated that they want to engage in action. But imagine how angry we are, and ensure that these actions and things that you're engaging in are rooted in supporting the safety and the needs of the Black community, rather than just disregarding that completely.    Social media is not it. That's not where it stops. Making a post on social media is not it, posting in those social media chains, saying Black Lives Matter online is not it. You can also donate to the multiple sources and bail funds that exist across the country for things that are going on.    You can engage in calling legislators and talking to folks  like the Los Angeles budget was being approved today and I encourage folks to call offices to change the budget that funds the police more than any basic needs within the budget. So just acknowledging and understanding these things, but also I want to emphasize checking in on Black folks too. People love to engage in Black culture but refuse to check in on those Black people that create this culture, so check in with those friends that you say you value so much, and just do a general mental health check. That's important too.    EB:   Are there any resources, like places to donate or anything else, that youd like to bring to students attention?    DUNKWU  : A lot of these freedom funds that are popping up, a lot of these projects are happening. I know a big one is the    Minnesota Freedom Fund   . If you look at our    demands   , we list some  I think it was the Minnesota Freedom Fund and it was a lot of other freedom funds in a lot of these other cities where these protests are happening. As well as that, I would say, trying to  and it gets a little bit tricky because you don't know what's official  but just giving back to the families of the victims.    DAVIS  : Yeah, I agree with that.    EB:   If the activism and donations start to slow down over the next few weeks, what do you think students should continue to do to show their support for these causes?    DUNKWU  : I think just continuing to apply pressure onto a lot of these, like I think (Dunkwu) was saying, applying pressure to like the mayor's office, or like these government things. But I think specifically for UCLA, I would say, try and just email professors on behalf of Black students, just trying to invoke them to be conscious that there's a lot going on in this world right now, and finals should be the last thing Black students have to worry about.    DAVIS  : Yeah, I completely agree with what (Dunkwu) says. But, also I feel like   for Black folks, being Black doesn't end. This doesn't end. And this won't end unless there's actual change.   This doesn't end for us. So the same way it doesn't end for us, it shouldn't end for allies or people that say that they care about Black lives. So my hope is that the posting does not stop. My hope is that the protesting does not stop until there's actual change that's made and not just a change specifically with George Floyds murder, with everyone that's been murdered by the police, with the police as an institution. So, yeah, that's my hope. This work isn't done until it stops, and it doesn't stop for me, because I'm still Black at the end of the day.    EB:   Is there anything that you wanted students to know generally, or anything we havent asked that you would like to address?    DAVIS  : I would say, I know there are some concerns and questions about how specifically people in the Westwood area or people around UCLA can get engaged in something thats supporting Black folks that also centers (around) Black folks, especially after the protest today was canceled. I will say that ASU is in the works of something for folks to be able to support, but were not going to give out definites right now. But we will definitely keep yall posted on what is going to come next, and what that looks like, and make sure all of the necessary precautions are made in whatever action is done, seeing the violence and different tactics that have been utilized by both the police and the National Guard across the country, with the current protests right now.    And   we also want to affirm we engage in this, not because we are ASU and we feel like we are the organization thats going to get everything done and we have to take a stake in this and were better than folks because were engaging in ASU. Its simply a priority to us because we are Black, and we know that these things and changes need to be made.    DUNKWU  : (Davis) kind of hit everything on the head. I would just say be informed. I feel like we already touched on this, but just be informed of what the impact of something as small as a Black Lives Matter chain that people put on their Instagrams can have on Black students. Or even just being mindful of sharing these graphic videos of these victims being killed, its traumatic. And its repeated trauma. So I think just being conscious of that, I would say.    DAVIS  : Yeah, I especially echo what (Dunkwu) just said, for those non-Black folks that are allies. And I also want to emphasize were supportive; and when I say we  we, I, ASU  are supportive of protesting.   Were supportive of taking action against police brutality and the current political climate that is basically taking our lives away.   In no way, shape or form are we not encouraging protesting.   But we are emphasizing being conscious when youre protesting and safely protesting and protecting yourself.   Its very difficult to be safe in conditions where the organizations that are in place dont want us to be safe. So remembering to take those precautions when you do decide to engage in protests is also an important point we want to make.

The university is working on providing support to students and faculty who were  verbally attacked  during the incidents, which took place during the first week of spring online instruction, Chancellor Gene Block  said in a campuswide email Wednesday.  &#8220;To all those who were targeted, to all those whose classes or meetings were disrupted, to all those whose sense of belonging was compromised, we promise we will do all we can to make sure UCLA fulfills its goal to create an equal learning environment that rejects bigotry and respects the value and dignity of everyone in our community,&#8221; Block said.  Block added that law enforcement is working with UCLA to put a name to those accountable for the Zoombombing incidents, and he also said that  those who experience incidents of bias can report them on the Office of the Dean of Students  website .   Dean of Students Maria Blandizzi said in a Facebook  post  that her office received reports of Zoombombing incidents, and added that her office will continue to hold students accountable to the Student Conduct Code, which prohibits harassment and disorderly behavior.  &#8220;As our campus community makes a challenging, uncertain transition to online learning amidst global panic and rising fatalities, certain individuals are choosing to spend their time by harassing, belittling, and attacking some of us,&#8221; Blandizzi said. &#8220;And that is not OK.&#8221;  Zoom has in place a set of features for additional security while in the classrooms.  Meeting hosts can silence and disable the video of participants. Hosts can also restrict participants&#8217; ability to chat among one another while the class is going on, as well as remove them from a meeting.  &#8220;We are deeply upset to hear about the incidents involving this type of attack,&#8221; said Janine Pelosi, Zoom&#8217;s chief marketing officer. &#8220;We take the security of Zoom meetings seriously and in order to prevent such incidents from occurring, we strongly encourage users to arrange their settings so that only hosts can share their screens, and utilize features such as 'Waiting Room' and host muting controls.&#8221;  Zoom has encouraged education users in particular to follow this guidance   and it recently updated the default screen sharing settings for the education users so teachers by default are the only ones who can share content in class, Pelosi said.  Professors, like Tim Groeling, who teaches communication at UCLA, are engaging with their departments to protect and secure the online learning environment.  &#8220;We talked about it as part of a faculty meeting,&#8221; Groeling said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to restrict access to enrolled students by using passwords or other means.&#8221;  Groeling said dealing with both the Zoombombers and the outbreak altogether may be unnerving, but added that he hopes the interruptions will be a short-term inconvenience.

The UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and UCLA Extension are hosting a program called COVID-19 Virtual Training Academy, which aims to train 10,000 to 20,000 contact tracers statewide, beginning with 1000 individuals per week in Los Angeles.  Contact tracing aims to break the chain of infection by preemptively identifying and isolating those who have come into contact with a COVID-19 patient, in order to prevent them from potentially infecting others.        LA Countys initial training cohort, which began May 6, consisted of roughly 550 trainees, who were civil servants with viable qualifications, such as language abilities and recent background checks. LAs second cohorts training began Monday.   &nbsp;        When a patient tests positive for COVID-19, a case investigator from the response team will reach out to the individual to identify who they have been in contact with since their infection, said Michael Reid, an assistant professor at the UCSF Institute for Global Health Diplomacy and Delivery.  The contact tracers will then follow up with the identified contacts to check if they have developed symptoms, and advise them to get tested and self-isolate for 14 days, said Reid.  Contact tracing is particularly important in preventing infections as California starts to relax restrictions, said Michael Prelip, a professor from the Department of Community Health Sciences at UCLA FSPH and co-leader of UCLAs response team.  ""If we do have a good system of testing, (tracing) and investigation, tracing it should make it easier to reduce some of the restrictions that are in place, said Prelip.  It is estimated that between 100,000 and 300,000 contact tracers are needed across the U.S. to have an impact on the spread of the coronavirus, said Reid.  On May 4th, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed training up to 20,000 case investigators and contract tracers in the state of California through this program.  It's crucial to identify all individuals infected by COVID-19 and their close contacts since a significant amount of transmissions occur before symptoms show up, Reid said.  (Contact tracing) is a basic principle of infectious disease control. (Whats challenging) about COVID-19 is the scale of the responses that's needed, Reid said. People have so many contacts, you need to mobilize a large workforce of people in order to respond effectively.  The trainees, who are chosen by the department of public health, are mainly civil servants who have been put out of work by the pandemic, Prelip said.  The training program takes a total of 20 hours, 12 of which are spent in live webinars covering COVID-19 epidemiology and the logistics of contact tracing, Reid said. Trainees also learn mandatory health insurance portability and accountability rules, confidentiality, communication skills, health coaching and motivational interviewing.  In the San Francisco contact tracer training demo, Susan Philips, an infectious disease specialist at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said that in order to encourage cooperation, the Department of Public Health will provide support to those in need, such as food or alternate housing arrangements.  Part of our effort today is also to make sure that people understand what we're doing and when we call they understand the purpose for it, Philip said.  Every call is a different person with a different story and different challenges, Reid said. Some people need to work and cannot afford to quarantine, while others may already be heavily symptomatic and require instant medical attention.  Contact tracers are specifically instructed to not ask for immigration status in order to encourage maximum cooperation, Philip said.  Immigration status has no bearing on the type of this work, and it has no bearing on the information we collect, Philip said. So people should not be concerned that that might be a barrier to working with us on this.  In the training demo, Reid added that contact tracers are instructed to not release names of the infected contacts or the dates of interaction.  The way that the prompt works is we ask are you aware of coming into contact with ... an individual suffering from COVID-19? Reid said. Sometimes they'll say yes, it was my mom or my sister but we don't volunteer the name of the individual even if they ask us for that information.

With most of the main characters together in Mexico &#8211; besides Emilio (Brandon Larracuente), whose Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status causes him to remain in Los Angeles &#8211; &#8220;Diaspora&#8221; reveals the family's shifting dynamics.    The extended season finale, however, doesn&#8217;t have many shocking moments or cliffhangers. Rather, it neatly wraps up most of its storylines, making &#8220;Party of Five&#8221; feel more like a limited series rather than a show with the potential to air for multiple seasons. The 10th episode results in a fitting ending should the lackluster ratings fail to push the series forward for another season.   [Related:    &#8216;Party of Five&#8217; season 1 review &#8211; episode 9: &#8216;Mexico&#8217;   ]    During its 10-episode run, &#8220;Party of Five&#8221; has remained mostly apolitical despite its subject matter. The show has focused on deportation and immigrant rights, yet there haven't been any direct references to President Donald Trump&#8217;s presidency or certain legislation passed under his watch. But in Wednesday&#8217;s episode, the characters expressed their growing frustration with the American justice system, grounding the show a bit more in the current political environment. The series has had to walk a fine line in terms of not appearing too preachy, but the Acostas' disappointment in the American justice system felt fully warranted in the season finale.      The timeliness of the show becomes particularly noticeable when Emilio    is forced to go to a parenting class by child services. He   walks out in frustration, clearly blaming the government for tearing his family apart. Valentina (Elle Paris Legaspi) is similarly irritated when her parents try to instill the idea that their home is in America. After all, from the 12-year-old's perspective, it was American laws that separated their family in the first place.    The other Acostas also find themselves in similarly desperate situations in the season finale. After accidentally revealing her interest in women &#8211; and seeing her mother&#8217;s resulting   shock and sadness &#8211; Lucia (Emily Tosta) forces herself to sleep with a boy who works at the hotel their family is staying at. The moment is a frantic attempt for Lucia to convince herself otherwise of her own sexuality, and it's the first time her character feels relatable and more than just a carbon copy of the stereotypical activist.   And as a last resort,   Javier (Bruno Bichir) also begs Gloria (Fernanda Urrejola), his now estranged wife, to consider having another baby in hopes of saving their marriage. The scene is emotional and devastating, another testament to the pair's compelling acting. Their chemistry is undeniable even in somber moments. Gloria refuses,   citing how it would be selfish to have another baby while her five children are alone in the states,    but   Val comes up with a new idea to bridge the gap that&#8217;s grown between   her parents.      The 12-year-old convinces   her mother and father to let her and baby Rafa   stay in Mexico indefinitely   so as to give them another opportunity at parenting. The decision is a shock for everyone, especially Emilio, who takes it the hardest. In conversation with Natalia (Sol Rodriguez), the 24-year-old admits that, rather than hampering his life, being a guardian to his siblings actually gives him a reason to be a better person.   [Related:    &#8216;Party of Five&#8217; season 1 review &#8211; episode 8: &#8216;Dos y Dos&#8217;   ]   Val then shares a touching goodbye with her older brothers, and the Acosta family ends the series more separated than when it began. But it's in these moments when &#8220;Party of Five&#8221; shines, as it examines the complexities of a family. What the show lacks in dramatic tension, it makes up in touching scenes and strong relationships between characters.   Still, other plot points take up space in what could have been a more exciting episode. Beto (Niko Guardado) and Ella&#8217;s (Audrey Gerthoffer) relationship troubles resolve themselves much too quickly, as she shows up unannounced   in Mexico and receives Javier and Gloria&#8217;s blessings. Emilio and Natalia also    suddenly   take their relationship to the next level as they officially    label   themselves boyfriend and girlfriend. The two travel to New York for a songwriting competition, something Emilio can do now that he isn't responsible for Val and Rafa.   As the siblings are now   even farther apart than before, &#8220;Diaspora&#8221; does set the ground for new possible storylines. But, while there are certainly unanswered questions, the series feels mostly concluded. Whereas most television seasons end on a titillating note, this finale lacks tension and doesn't inspire any burning desire to return for more episodes. Nevertheless,   the show deserves credit for its ability to shine a light on a timely topic, which   may be reason enough for Freeform to renew it for another season.  After all, the Acostas reflect the struggles   millions are facing &#8211; it feels only right for them to continue their story.

Friday, they'll be together again  albeit, not in person.  The teammates have crossed paths here and there in the decades since they secured UCLA men's basketball's 11th title in an 89-78 victory over Arkansas on April 3, 1995, but Edney said almost the entire team will be hopping online to reminisce together Friday night.  ""We're all going to be getting on one of these Zoom calls and doing a 25-year reunion celebration thing, so I know that will be fun,"" Edney said. ""It was (Bailey's) idea, he reached out to us a couple days ago. And then he set it all up and everybody responded.""  Bailey said he had to pull out all the stops to get everyone on the same page for the meeting, using email, text, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger to get in touch with former teammates, managers and coaches from Los Angeles to Japan to Croatia.  ""I've been getting a lot of Zoom meetings for work and family,"" Bailey said. ""When people started calling and reminding me that it was the reunion (Friday), I figured it'd be great to get the guys together and see what everybody's up to.""  The Bruins have yet to win a title in the quarter-century since Edney and O'Bannon left, making the 1995 tournament run the last time UCLA stood alone atop the college basketball world. Several moments of that campaign have been immortalized, such as Edney's late-game heroics against Missouri in the second round.  With 4.8 seconds left on the clock, coach Jim Harrick called a timeout with his team down 74-73. Instead of drawing up a play for their All-American and leading scorer O'Bannon, Harrick called Edney's number.  [caption id=""attachment_377965"" align=""alignright"" width=""196""]  Tyus Edney averaged 12.1 points and 5.2 assists per game across his 125 career games with the Bruins. Edney's buzzer-beater against Missouri in the second round of the 1995 NCAA tournament kept UCLA men's basketball's title hopes alive. (Daily Bruin file photo)[/caption]  ""It was a tough memory at first  we were struggling, Missouri had a really good team, so they were basically outplaying us,"" Edney said. ""Most of the time, we looked to (O'Bannon) ... to bail us out. This time, coach said, 'I want you to shoot the ball  do you understand what I'm telling you?'""  Edney took the ball the length of the court and hit the teardrop layup in traffic as the final buzzer sounded, keeping the Bruins alive en route to an eventual Final Four trip. In a double-digit victory over Oklahoma State in the national semifinals, however, Edney hurt his wrist and his status for the championship game was up in the air.  ""Going into the championship, I started panicking because that night and the next morning was a nightmare,"" Edney said. ""I kind of begged (Harrick), 'Please coach, let me see if I can do it.' But it was just too bad, so that was tough to sit out most of the game. He let me start, but I was a liability, ... so I became a cheerleader.""  Not every cheerleader gets to hold the trophy at the end of the game, but Edney did. In his absence, Cameron Dollar took over at point and ran the offense well enough to win the game.  Dollar  who averaged just 3.4 points and 3.1 assists per game during the 1994-1995 season  played 36 minutes in Edney's place, leading the team with eight assists and four steals.  The pair of point guards only totaled six points in the game, but O'Bannon and Bailey more than made up for that.  The two combined for 56 points and 26 rebounds, with O'Bannon never subbing out the entire game. O'Bannon's championship-winning 30-piece capped off his final season with UCLA, a season in which he averaged 20.4 points and won the John R. Wooden Award, Pac-10 co-Player of the Year and Final Four Most Outstanding Player Award.  Then-freshman Bailey had scored just two points in the game prior against Oklahoma State, but he said he knew he would bounce back when the title game came around.  ""I knew I was going to have a good game because of the style of play,"" Bailey said. ""Arkansas, they were known for playing fast-paced  40 Minutes of Hell and pressing the entire time  so I knew that would be conducive to the way I played. I was excited for it.""  There won't be a men's basketball champion crowned in 2020 now that the NCAA has canceled all winter championships because of the coronavirus outbreak, meaning redshirt seniors Prince Ali and Alex Olesinski won't get the chance to match the 1995 team's accomplishments.  ""Since I've been an 18-year-old kid, I've known March Madness is coming around, I get that feeling, I get excited, you never know what's going to happen,"" Bailey said. ""To not have that this year, I really feel for the kids because I know how special it was to us.""  Edney, who was an assistant coach for UCLA from 2017 to 2019, said he's tried reaching out to some of the veterans on the team to try to talk them through these tough times.  ""A couple of the seniors, I'm trying to help out, see what their next move is and see if there's anything I can do,"" Edney said. ""The guys coming back, obviously they have time, but the seniors are the ones getting the bad end of the stick.""  Despite ending the season as a projected play-in No. 11 seed in ESPN's bracketology, UCLA has snuck its way into some outlets' early top 25 rankings for 2020-2021.  Edney wouldn't take a hard stance on whether or not the 1995 team could beat the current iteration of the Bruins, but he did express a sliver of confidence in his former teammates.  ""Oh, you're trying to cause some controversy,"" Edney said, laughing. ""I don't know, I think we would have done alright.""",['cap-sam-connon'],"['mens-basketball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-03-at-6.28.10-PM.png

The board accepted UC President Janet Napolitanos recommendation 23-0, meaning the UC system will make standardized tests optional through 2022 and fully suspend the use of the tests for admissions by 2024.    The UC will also work to make a new test that would be available to California high school students to use in admissions. If the UC is unable to create a new test by fall 2025, the University will not resume its use of the SAT or ACT in admissions considerations, according to the recommendation.    The decision went against the Standardized Testing Task Forces    report    published in January, which stated the UC should conduct additional research before making a decision to go test-optional.    [Related link:    Report recommends retention of UC standardized testing admissions requirement   ]    The Standardized Testing Task Force was created by the Academic Senate in January 2019 at Napolitanos request to examine the degree to which standardized test scores predict student success and whether alternative measures of testing should be developed.    The regents discussed the item for about five hours before finally reaching a decision.    Alumni Regent Christine Simmons said that decades of data support that standardized tests are exclusionary and discriminatory.    Its time to innovate how we teach, Simmons said. Its time to reassess what success in education looks like. We have this antiquated model, ... and it starts with that test.    While Academic Senate chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani agreed that the tests are discriminatory, she said that the senates report found that their use in the UC system is not.    The main reason we are looking at SATs is because they are racist, Bhavnani said. No one disputes that. What the task force found, however, was that the way in which the UC uses them stops them (from) being (discriminatory).    Bhavnani suggested that the UC take a different approach to allow the University to gather more data.    Similarly, Regent Jay Sures proposed that instead of following Napolitanos recommendation, the UC make standardized tests optional for two years and then look at the data before making a decision.    However, Napolitano said at the board meeting that she believes it is time for the regents to make a decision about standardized testing.    We have been talking about this for decades, Simmons said.

It will never be enough to proclaim that Black Lives Matter, and then proceed to continue teaching classes as if those same Black students are unaffected by what&#8217;s happening.   On May 25, 46-year-old George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis when a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on his neck for more than seven minutes, all while other officers did nothing but watch. In the same vein, our nation&#8217;s history underscores that this is not an isolated incident, but rather that police brutality and anti-Blackness are deeply woven into the fabric of our society.  Many of our students who are impassioned and embroiled within the fight for the Black community are on the frontlines, figuratively and literally. There have been UCLA students who have gone to show their solidarity and have been brutalized by police at these protests, whether they were shot by rubber bullets or tear-gassed for exercising their constitutional right to protest. There have been countless students who have made a choice to set aside their formal academic studies to call for justice in the United States. Such a decision should be honored.  Beyond those who are on the ground, many of us have been active on social media and bombarded with images of murder and  the mass militarization of our neighborhoods  while simultaneously attempting to organize online.  We must hold our university faculty and professors accountable to hear these concerns and not be complicit in their response. The current political climate not only weighs heavily on the hearts and minds of Black students, but white, Latinx, Asian, and indigenous allies who are far too tired and fed up with the injustices we face as Black people. This is not just a &#8220;Los Angeles&#8221; uprising, but rather an international movement.  As UCLA students, we are intimately aware of the fact that we attend one of the nation&#8217;s most prestigious and challenging institutions. Yet, as if it was not enough to witness the killings of Floyd, Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, we are still amid the world&#8217;s worst public health crisis in decades. It is because of these circumstances, that we must place the well-being of our students above that of academic rigor.  We call upon professors to move to making finals optional wherever possible, or provide accommodations such as those listed within the  Academic Senate&#8217;s guidelines  regarding final examinations. You cannot expect students to study, write papers and take tests under these types of physical, mental and emotional conditions.  The university has  committed  to value the lives of Black students, and we must not leave out our professors from that very same promise.

So much so, that the week in which California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued the  shelter in place  order the search question how to glow up peaked in its popularity on  Google . On  YouTube , the global average daily viewing of videos with titles containing the phrase workout at home has increased over 200% since March 15. And on  TikTok , as of Friday the hashtag #coronaglowup, which began during this period of quarantine has more than 4.6 million views.  The term ""glow up""  emerged in the early 2010s  as a play on the phrase ""grow up,"" and sparked a trend in the latter half of the decade of pitting a recent photo against an older one from adolescence to show off one's positive physical transformation.  While at first ""glow up"" referred to holistic development (i.e. both mental and physical maturity), over the years, the phrase was narrowed to usually reference physical change. Now, the process of glowing up is a self-initiated one that typically entails weight loss, clearer skin and anything else that leads to appearance improvement.""  Noelle Cho, a fourth-year business economics student, suggested that while ""glowing up"" began with a positive motive, it carries with it many negative cultural consequences.  ""It was like a boost of self-confidence when most people start that (process),"" Cho said. ""But gradually it's turning into a person pressuring themselves to conform to this ideal image of the beauty standards of society.""  Interestingly, it seems that the pressure to perfect one's physical appearance hasn't disappeared in times of self-quarantine, even when most of us aren't seeing many people day-to-day.  Helen Zhong, a fourth-year gender studies and sociology student and co-director of UCLAs Body Image Task Force linked this pressure for self-generated improvement to the desire for control in the midst of this anxiety-inducing time.  It feels like a very easy thing to latch onto if you're stuck at home with nothing to do, and things feel really overwhelming, Zhong said. Maybe people are kind of looking for a sense of control, and it's a very common belief that your appearance or your weight or your body is something that you can control. ... I think that that is kind of the dominant narrative.  Similarly, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health adjunct professor, William J. McCarthy, further said that this idea of complete control of your outward appearance and inward emotional state   is an illusion.  What you think of as yourself is really a super-organism that indeed contains human cells, but it also contains a lot of stranger cells (called) microbial cells that are not human, McCarthy said. No one has total control, because we are dependent. We are interdependent with these microbes and in fact with our fellow humans.  Clearly, some things about our bodies are not possible to change. But, ""glow-up culture"" also seems to encourage another impossible feat: expecting dramatic bodily transformations to occur over increasingly short periods of time.  The unrealistic expectation can be observed in the thousands of workout videos with such titles as Intense Ab Workout (Flat Tummy in 1 WEEK) 5 minute Fat Burn and 1 Week Flat Stomach Workout (Intense!).""   These types of videos and extreme diet plans garner millions of views, but promise results that may be unattainable and feed into a culture of fast results.  Perhaps the greatest current example of this is the massively popular ""2 Weeks Shred Challenge"" created by Chloe Ting, a fitness YouTuber. In fact, just one video from the program, ""Get Abs in 2 WEEKS,"" has more than 75 million views, and the TikTok hashtag ""#chloetingchallenge"" that was inspired by the program has more than 87 million views.  However, McCarthy argues that these rapid physical changes are not the best way to approach improving one's health.  ""This (trend of ""glowing up"" is a) very natural human tendency to want to make good changes in a very short time,"" McCarthy said. ""And I understand where it comes from because people are frustrated, and they want an answer immediately. But that's not the way Mother Nature works. She works slowly.""  The search for a quick transformation can lead to unhealthy weight control practices, including fasting and extreme caloric restriction, compensatory exercise and stimulant consumption, such as ephedrine and caffeine.   These extreme solutions and rapid weight loss attempts are not only ultimately unsustainable but can damage ones physical health.  Additionally, the cultural obsession with glowing up is a breeding ground for eating disorders, which can arise as a  result  of popular cultures unrealistic beauty standards and peer pressure. In fact, the  greatest environmental contributor  to eating disorder development is the sociocultural idealization of thinness  the very thinness that is encouraged by glow up culture.  ""It's all good intentions at the beginning, like, 'I'm trying to be fit, I'm trying to be healthy,'"" Cho said. ""But it's so easy to go overboard because ... you look in the mirror, and you see the difference and you see that, 'Oh, I'm losing weight, I'm thinner, so I feel better about myself.'... People are trying to make their bodies fit into a cosmetic mold""  So then, what does well-being look like in this age of pressurized improvement?  ""It's important to keep in mind that you deserve all the things that everyone deserves,"" Zhong said. ""You deserve to eat and to take up space and to, you know, be happy. And you don't need to ... look a certain way to deserve those things.""  Self-improvement is good. Healthy choices are good. Physical activity and nutritious food have been proven over and over again to improve both mental and physical health  things which are especially crucial now.  ""My two pieces of advice (for quarantine): 30 minutes of exercise a day, and make sure you feed your microbes well,"" McCarthy said.  But, as Cho advised, it is important to not be swept away by the results of healthy actions rather than enjoying the process.  ""Feel happy that you're doing something exciting, instead of, 'Oh, I need to work out because I sat in my room for however long staring at my Zoom lecture, so I need to burn this calorie off,'"" Cho said.  With millions of people around the world confined to their homes, shelter-in-place creates a place for self-focus, and it might seem like a great idea to undergo a complete physical, mental and spiritual metamorphosis.  However, as Zhong suggested, this metamorphosis should not take priority.  ""There's so much talk about self-improvement during quarantine, and that's not something that we owe to ourselves or to anyone,"" Zhong said. ""This is a pandemic, you know, it's a global disaster basically. ... We shouldn't feel like we need to do anything except get through it.""  Not to worry, Bruins. The world is not going to fall apart if you don't have abs in two weeks.

The plan splits all of UCLAs student-athletes into one of four groups: Group 1 contains all fall Olympic sport student-athletes who live locally plus the football team, Group 2 is composed of mens and womens basketball student-athletes, Group 3 comprises the remainder of fall Olympic sport athletes and all other student-athletes who live locally and Group 4 consists of all the remaining student-athletes.    The statement does not clarify what is considered local for student-athletes to return with their respective groups.    There is no current timetable for when groups two to four will be allowed back on campus, but for   members of Group 1, the voluntary activities of Phase One start as soon as Monday and student-athletes will have the choice to participate.    The mode of transportation that the student-athletes use to return to Westwood will determine whether or not they must partake in a seven-day quarantining period before attending team-sanctioned activities. Student-athletes who arrive by personal vehicle will be exempt from the quarantine period, but those traveling by plane must self-quarantine before reporting for medical screenings.    Once the quarantine period  for those who need it  has passed, all the student-athletes will undergo tests for COVID-19 and antibodies. Assuming they are cleared by medical personnel, they will enter Phase Two.    Phase Two is the return to athletic training, meaning that voluntary workouts  including strength and conditioning activities  will be permitted, given that each workout is performed in groups of 10 of fewer student-athletes, with athletic performance staff supervision.    Everybody who enters an athletic facility will need to abide by the following protocol: daily temperature screening, daily wellness survey, face coverings worn at all times (unless activity suggests otherwise), physical distancing of at least six feet at all times, designated student-athlete groups of 10 or fewer and limited use of facilities  specifically, only where athletic performance and sports medicine activities are taking place.    In addition, all equipment will be frequently cleaned and sanitized between use by the designated groups.    Phase Three is the return to practice. Student-athletes and staff who have cleared the first two phases will be permitted to return to permissive voluntary captains practices, and organized practices that lie within the Pac-12 and NCAA guidelines. The plan noted that there is no current timetable for when Phase Three will be allowed.    Phase Four is the return to competition and also has no concrete implementation date. Designated student-athletes and staff who cleared the first three phases will be allowed to participate in competition, given that the Pac-12 and NCAA guidelines are met. Specific plans for each sport will be announced based on state and local guidelines.    The plan also includes information about the fueling of the student-athletes via pre-packaged food and ready-to-drink beverages. All staff working with the student-athletes are required to wear face coverings and participate in physical distancing and are encouraged to avoid large social gatherings.

This would be the first fee increase because of referendums in four years.  This years ballot features two referendums  Cultivating Unity for Bruins and Good Clothes Good People Basic Needs, which would increase student fees by $45 and $0.99, respectively. The CUB referendum would fund a Black Resource Center, pay rent for the Transfer Student Center and create more spaces for meditation, while the GCGP referendum would fund the addition of school supplies and hygiene products to USACs GCGP redistribution center.  A referendum is a proposition placed on the USAC ballot by students to increase student fees. Any student can draft a referendum and present it to USAC. The council then votes whether to put the referendum on the ballot, which they do in most cases, said USAC President Robert Watson.  Students can also collect a petition with 10% of the student bodys signatures to bypass USACs process and put a referendum on the ballot directly, Watson said.  The last time referenda were on the ballot was in 2016, which consisted of The Green Initiative Fund referendum, the #UCLAStudent Wellness referendum, the Social Justice referendum and the Daily Bruin and Bruinwalk referendum. All four passed, raising yearly fees per student by $101.97, and maintaining a $14.40 TGIF fee.   All data for the below graphs was gathered from the registrars office and from what was available on USAC budget reports.      Graph courtesy of Bernard Mendez, Kelly Chen, Laurel Woods, Mattie Sanseverino, Sydney Kovach and Keri Chen.   Eighteen referendums have been passed in the history of USAC. Students now pay $294.57 toward referenda fees each year, not including the Undergraduate Students Association Fee, according to the UCLA Registrars Office  website .  The USA fee has risen over the years from $24 in 1982 to $262.28 today, in part because of added referendums. Students pay $556.85 a year toward referendums and referendum-related fees.  Some of these funds are managed by USAC, such as the Bruin Bash Fee, but others are directed by the groups that drafted the referendums. Fees have also risen over the years because of inflation.  The council has the ability to endorse referendums, but cannot enact them, Watson said.  Both referendums on this years ballot are endorsed by USAC. The movement was nearly unanimous, with only one council member, General Representative 2 Orion Smedley, abstaining.  Besides needing majority approval to pass, referendums have a 15% voting threshold, meaning that if less than 15% of the student body votes in the election, both referendums will automatically fail. The University of California Office of the President lowered the threshold last year from 20%.  Several social media posts have expressed disapproval toward USAC for supposedly raising student fees amid a global pandemic. One  UCLA subreddit post  from April titled USAC is once again trying to increase your fees! Vote NO on both referendums May 4-8. This is not the time to increase student fees. has received more than 700 upvotes.  We get pretty frustrated when we see people saying USAC is trying to increase student fees, and USAC wrote these referenda, Watson said. USAC did not write these referenda, nor is USAC leading them. Referenda can come about from any student.  However, USAC may be able to use money from the referendums if any funds collected are not spent for its intended purpose by the end of the year, said Roy Champawat, director of the Student Union. The funds will be labeled as ""surplus"" and the following years council can put the funds into contingency or USA programming funds, which are distributed to student groups.  The council can also vote to send the surplus back to where it came from. If, for example, there was a $10,000 surplus for Bruin Bash in a previous year, the council could vote to send that surplus back to Bruin Bash to use for the coming year. However, students would still pay all Bruin Bash fees for the coming year, despite the additional funds it may have received, Champawat said.      Graph courtesy of Bernard Mendez, Kelly Chen, Laurel Woods, Mattie Sanseverino, Sydney Kovach and Keri Chen.   The council ultimately decides how this extra money will be used. This years surplus was  distributed within USAC.   Students can remove or change a referendum in the same way they approve it  by proposing the idea to USAC or drafting a petition, which can put it on the ballot, Watson said.  However, typically referenda are used productively to an extent where there's not a need to lower the fee, he said.      Graph courtesy of Bernard Mendez, Kelly Chen, Laurel Woods, Mattie Sanseverino, Sydney Kovach and Keri Chen.   Watson said some fees could be increased, since for example, the cost to hire artists for Bruin Bash, operate Ackerman Union and Kerckhoff Hall and maintain aging buildings on campus go up each year.  Changing or removing a referendum has never happened before, Watson said.  It hasn't happened for a good reason, he said. These things are designed to stay in place so that they can be used consistently year to year.  Alexandria Davis, chairperson of the Afrikan Student Union at UCLA, is one of the authors of the CUB referendum. Davis said the process of creating the CUB referendum took several months.  After meeting with Mother Organizations, the Transfer Leadership Coalition and other groups to discuss the lack of funding for underserved communities, Davis, along with others, drafted the referendums goals. When setting the price, they took into account building costs from ASUCLA, which are set at $6.89 per square foot, she said.  Six percent of what we earn (from the referendum would go) to a programming fund specifically for the Black Resource Center, which was my specific ask, Davis said. Now there's a $60,000 programming budget each year for the Black Resource Center.  For all referenda, 25% of funds return to financial aid. This is intended to offset the added cost that students on need-based financial aid will have to pay, Watson said.  All ballot language and supplemental ballot language is binding, Watson said, so money can not be spent in any other way than what is written.  A lot of students just read the ballot language and think, This is too broad, what does this even mean, etc., Watson said. Theyre supposed to be broad so that they can be used in many different ways (within the ballot and supplementary ballot language) as the years go by.""

Among the groups speaking out in support of the protests is the UCLA gymnastics program, which has been at the forefront of the movement in the Bruin community.   &#8220;Our hearts ache for the hurt in our country,&#8221; UCLA gymnastics said in a statement on Twitter. &#8220;We must address racial prejudice and violence. We must do better. The fear and danger suffered by the black community is real. Let&#8217;s educate, organize and implement plans for change.&#8221;  Not all programs, however, have been as vocal.   Of the eight Pac-12 gymnastics programs, UCLA was the first to release a statement. Oklahoma &#8211; the reigning national champions &#8211; also waited multiple days to release an official statement on the matter.  In addition to their initial statement, UCLA gymnastics has also continued to share additional information in the form of articles, donation and petition links for various causes and even tips about which hashtags to use to best help the movement.  Sophomore Margzetta Frazier &#8211; who was a second-team regular season All-American and a first-team All-Pac-12 honoree on bars this past season &#8211; said she is proud of her school and that she couldn't see herself at any other institution.  &#8220;Although UCLA is not perfect, it is certainly ahead of most schools with its activism in change and equality for others,"" Frazier said. ""I am very proud to say that I go to a school that rewards inclusivity and is a big advocate for equality.""      Frazier is one of many individual Bruin gymnasts who have voiced their opinions, tweeting her support for ending racism.  With almost 8,000 followers on Twitter, Frazier said it is especially important to use her platform now because of the reach that it currently has.  &#8220;Now is the perfect time to finally educate and to teach people to dismantle what they think they know about racism,&#8221; Frazier said. &#8220;I have a platform that reaches people of many countries and many ages and races, and I am doing my part in helping the Black experience be of equality and justice.&#8221;  Other UCLA gymnasts &#8211; both past and present &#8211; have also found ways to get involved.   Current Bruins such as senior Felicia Hano and freshman Kalyany Steele have turned to social media in order to get their messages across, posting on both Twitter and Instagram in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.  Hano &#8211; who is of Mexican descent &#8211; encouraged people of different races to start a dialogue about racial issues, and Steele took part in ""Blackout Tuesday,"" an initiative in which people posted black screens on social media platforms, among other acts, to show solidarity.  Rechelle Dennis, who competed at UCLA from 2014 to 2018, shared a survey on Twitter for Black student-athletes to tell their stories through the platform ESSENCE Girls United. Hallie Mossett, a Bruin gymnast from 2013 to 2017, shared a video of herself on Twitter reciting a poem titled ""Freedom Is"" that she wrote three years ago and says still resonates with her today.   Coach Chris Waller said he is proud that these athletes expanded their platforms and found their voices.   &#8220;I can't say enough about how proud I am for our student-athletes to be active politically and socially,&#8221; Waller said. &#8220;We talk so much about how gymnastics is simply a platform for us to learn life lessons, and those life lessons should be applied to our life and the greater world.&#8221;  This isn&#8217;t the first time that the Bruins have used their platforms as a means for social change, as they have spoken out about social issues in the past.  In the aftermath of the USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal, UCLA co-hosted the ""Together We Rise"" competition along with Oklahoma to honor the sexual abuse survivors of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.  Waller said Valorie Kondos Field &#8211; the UCLA gymnastics coach from 1991 to 2019 &#8211; was instrumental in instilling a culture that promotes and celebrates the athletes&#8217; voices.  &#8220;The cornerstone of the program under (Kondos Field was) the basic idea that when any person figures out how to be their own best self, they will shine the brightest, be the most self-confident and ultimately help UCLA gymnastics the most,&#8221; Waller said.  Despite everything that has been taking place &#8211; ranging from the protests to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic &#8211; the team has still found ways to stay together. Daily text messages and phone calls between coaches and athletes keep the team connected.  A team call with a sports psychologist has also been planned for the athletes to discuss what has been happening and to give the players a place to vent.  According to Frazier, the team has also been in contact to make even more plans to share its message of unity as a group.  &#8220;Behind the scenes, we are working on a few projects to get our message across to all age groups and races,&#8221; Frazier said. &#8220;We hope that we can educate at least one person on equality.&#8221; ",['cap-jon-christon'],"['features', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.sp_.gradissue.margzetta.AB_.jpg

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was signed into law on March 27, is providing $1,200 a month to each American adult whose individual income is $75,000 or less. The CARES Act also provided colleges with emergency aid for their students.   The University of California received $260 million in funding from the stimulus package, with UCLA specifically receiving about $36 million.   However, undocumented immigrants, including students in the UCLA community, were excluded from payments in the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos released guidelines in late April specifying that the funding given to colleges cannot be used to support undocumented or international students.   Some undocumented students who have a work visa through DACA are able to receive unemployment benefits, but for many other undocumented students it is not possible, said Valeria Garcia, program director for the Undocumented Student Program at UCLA, in an emailed statement.   &#8220;As the Pandemic and Stay-at-Home order continues, undocumented students like everyone else will need to receive additional support,&#8221; Garcia said in the statement.  In order to support undocumented California residents who were left out of the stimulus package, California Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to provide them with cash payments.   Newsom's package, the Disaster Relief Assistance for Immigrants, includes $20 million for Los Angeles County. The Los Angeles area contains 31% of California&#8217;s undocumented population, which is the highest percentage of any area within the state, according to Newsom&#8217;s Disaster Relief for Immigrants Project fact sheet.   Newsom plans to give 150,000 adult undocumented immigrants a one-time stimulus payment of $500. The payments will be funded by a combination of taxpayer money and charitable contributions, according to CNBC.   &#8220;We are proud to be the first state in the nation to announce a project for direct disaster relief assistance to undocumented residents, and this assistance will certainly help these individuals and families during this pandemic,&#8221; said Scott Murray, a spokesperson for the California Department of Social Services, in an emailed statement.   UCLA also plans to provide $200 universal impact awards to undocumented and international students using the university&#8217;s private and institutional grants.   Garcia said in her email she believes this money could help undocumented students at UCLA, but pointed out that these funds may not be enough.  &#8220;These funds will be critical in supporting some of the basic needs for undocumented students and their families,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;(But) it&#8217;s important to note that these funds do not equal the amount that is given to individuals through the CARES Act.&#8221;  The Undocumented Student Program remains open virtually to support undocumented students with access to legal help, grant or scholarship programs, and professional and student staff who can help, Garcia added.  Rick Tuttle, a former instructor of public policy at UCLA, said he believes many undocumented students have lost their jobs because of the isolation and shutting down of many establishments.  Without a source of income, Tuttle said some undocumented students may be unable to pay for essential items, such as groceries.  &#8220;We are all living together in this country whether we are documented, undocumented, ... and yet part of our community of fellow human beings are being left out,&#8221; Tuttle said. &#8220;In some cases, I imagine there's a level of desperation setting in.&#8221;  Tuttle added that politicians should move beyond their partisan biases in order to support the entire community.  &#8220;I hope Congress and the president will get together and remedy this,&#8221; Tuttle said. &#8220;We need to set aside all the politics of the last few years and just help us all through this.&#8221; ",['cap-lily-flick'],"['california', 'campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ns_.DACAcoronasupport.file_.jpg

Napolitano said in a    letter    to the UC community on Monday that the UC will also freeze salaries for nonunionized staff employees and nonstudent academic appointees next year, meaning these employees will not see salary increases.    The UC campuses and Office of the President are also developing budget scenarios that anticipate cuts for the next fiscal year, and are looking to reduce expenses, like through eliminating nonessential travel, Napolitano said.    We continue to work closely with the State of California and the federal government to secure any and all additional funding available to help address the shortfalls, Napolitano said. Much of the funding is designated for student financial aid, and while we are grateful for the funding, we do not anticipate full reimbursement for our losses.    The UC already faced a financial loss of almost $1.2 billion from mid-March through April   before California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a 10% cut to state funding for public colleges and universities in his    revised budget proposal    on Friday  .   The cut would reduce UC funding by $372 million.

With the Bruins sitting out the first round with a bye, they could potentially match up with all 11 of their conference foes at some point over the weekend. Heres a look at how each teams resume stacks up.    No. 1 seed Oregon (24-7, 13-5 Pac-12)   MVP: Payton Pritchard Most Interesting Stat: 39.6% 3-point shooting percentage (No. 4 in NCAA) Pac-12 Championship Odds: 5-to-4  [caption id=""attachment_377097"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Daily Bruin file photo)[/caption]  The battle for Pac-12 regular-season supremacy between the Bruins and the Ducks came down to each teams last game Saturday  with Oregon riding a three-game win streak and UCLA on a seven-game winning run. Oregon secured the win on the last day of Pac-12 play while UCLA fell to USC on a last-second 3.  UCLA suffered its largest loss of the season in terms of point differential to Oregon on Jan. 26, losing by 21 points in Eugene. The Ducks shot 57.1% from the field and 47.8% from 3 to score 96 points  the most scored by the Bruins or their opponents this season.  Oregon also picked off a season-high 15 steals, six of which came from guard Chris Duarte  three days after the junior notched eight thefts against USC. The score would have been even more lopsided if not for freshman guard/forward Jake Kymans 20 points  more than he cumulatively scored in his next six games.  No visiting team came away from the Matthew Knight Arena happy, as the Ducks swept their slate of 17 home games. Away from home, they posted a mortal 7-7 record on the season.  The Ducks are placed on the other side of the bracket of the Bruins, so the only possible encounter between the two teams would be for the tournament title.  Coach Mick Cronin called for Oregon guard Payton Pritchard to become the poster child for college basketball in a press conference Jan. 21. The Pac-12 Player of the Year is the only player in the conference averaging more than 20 points per game and is shooting 41.5% from deep.  After leading Oregon to the tournament title last year by winning the Pac-12 Tournament Most Outstanding Player award, Pritchard came back for his final season, increasing his points, rebounds and assists averages in the process.   No. 3 seed Arizona State (20-11, 11-7 Pac-12)  MVP: Remy Martin Most Interesting Stat: 73 points per game (No. 1 in Pac-12) Pac-12 Championship Odds: 10-to-1  [caption id=""attachment_377098"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""966""]    (MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  The Sun Devils drew the hype before the season had even begun, and coach Bobby Hurleys team seemed to live up to expectations with a hot nonconference start.  The teams only two losses before Dec. 14 came against Colorado in China and defending national champion Virginia by just three points.  Arizona State was more up than down in conference play but split the conference series against Oregon, Arizona, UCLA, USC, Washington and Washington State. The Sun Devils had the hottest offense in the league, averaging 73 points per game in conference matches.  However, their top-tier offense was balanced by the second-worst conference defense allowing 72.5 points per game.  The Sun Devils were led by guard Remy Martin, who is the second-leading scorer in the Pac-12. The roster included three additional players averaging more than 10 points per game, helping relieve Martin of some of the scoring burden on his nights where his shot was not falling.  Despite dropping three of its past four games, Arizona State still finished with the No. 3 seed in the conference tournament, good for a first-round bye. And should it defeat the winner of Colorado and Washington State on Thursday, it could potentially face UCLA in the semifinal.  In the two contests against the Bruins, Martin scored 15 points in a winning effort and 30 in the Sun Devils loss at Pauley Pavilion. Should the two teams meet in the tournament, the supporting cast around Martin will be the difference maker in the outcome.   No. 4 seed USC (22-9, 11-7 Pac-12)  MVP: Onyeka Okongwu Most Interesting Stat: 64.3 points allowed per game (No. 1 in Pac-12) Pac-12 Championship Odds: 10-to-1  [caption id=""attachment_377099"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  The Trojans love to play in Los Angeles.  Across 15 games at either the Galen Center, Staples Center or Pauley Pavilion, USC was 16-2 on the year, including wins over LSU, both Arizona schools and UCLA.  But outside of city limits, coach Andy Enfield and his squad were 6-7.  While forward Onyeka Okongwu roams the paint and averages 16.2 points and 8.6 rebounds per game, teams should be wary of crashing the lane.  If defenses swarm inside, guard Jonah Matthews will be waiting to pounce. The senior averaged 38.1% from deep on 5.8 attempts per game and spaced out the Trojans when teams decided to put pressure on Okongwu.  The Trojans should be able to make it to at least the semifinals of the Pac-12 tournament after they secured a first-round bye after beating UCLA on March 7.  Despite currently sitting on the bubble in recent forecasts, a three-game winning streak to end the regular season  coupled with a No. 43 NET ranking  should be enough to put the Trojans safely into the NCAA tournament.  USC and UCLA can only meet in the finals of the tournament, and the Bruins should be glad about that. The Trojans were the only team to beat the Bruins twice this season, with an 11-point win in Westwood on Jan. 11 followed up with a last-second victory in the rematch.   No. 5 seed Arizona (20-11, 10-8 Pac-12)  MVP: Zeke Nnaji Most Interesting Stat: 1.3-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio (No. 1 in Pac-12) Pac-12 Championship Odds: 3-to-1  [caption id=""attachment_377100"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Jintak Han/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Even with three potential lottery picks in the upcoming draft, the Wildcats season thus far has been a series of ups and downs.  After starting the season off by ripping nine straight wins, Arizona is .500 since then.  The Wildcats talented trio of NBA-bound freshmen  Pac-12 Freshman of the Year forward Zeke Nnaji, guard Nico Mannion and guard Josh Green  have not disappointed, combining for 54% of their scoring this year.  While Mannion was the most hyped out of the three recruits, he has struggled to score efficiently, shooting 39% from the field. Nnaji is fourth in the Pac-12 in field goal percentage  converting 57.3% of his attempts for 16.3 points per game  and is fifth in the conference with 8.6 boards a game.  Despite its star-studded roster, Arizona has attained success this season through defense, ranking 15th in the nation in adjusted defensive efficiency, according to KenPom.com. The team is stifling opponents at the rim, allowing them to shoot 54.1% while shooting 66.1% from the same area on the other end of the court, according to Haslametrics.  The Wildcats are a lock to make the NCAA tournament, ranking 14th in the country in the NET rankings, despite being the only top-20 team with more than 10 losses.  While Arizona would undoubtedly be a formidable opponent, UCLA will be comforted by its two wins  both at home and away  against the Wildcats this season. They will also not have the support of the conference-leading 13,654 fans that showed up on average to the McKale Center during the Pac-12 tournament.

The Buffaloes currently average 69.8 possessions a game, ranking 234th in the nation  just ahead of the Bruins 68.2 possessions per game.  Both teams also have similar mentalities attacking the glass, posting the two best rebounding margins in the conference. Colorados rebounding margin is slightly behind UCLAs 5.6 rebounds per game advantage, led by Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year Tyler Beys Pac-12-topping 9.1 boards a game.  Colorado coach Tad Boyle has a veteran-laden group at his disposal, with six of his seven leading scorers being upperclassmen. Their collective experience has helped them go 4-3 in games decided by two possessions or fewer.  The Bruins are one of the best teams at heading to the charity stripe, averaging 31.8 free throw attempts per 100 possessions  good for 12th in the country, according to Haslametrics  but the Buffaloes are also one of the best teams in the nations at restricting opponents from getting to the foul line. Colorado allows 18.5 free throw attempts per 100 possessions and commits a conference-low 14.5 fouls per game.  Junior guard Chris Smith averaged 22 points and 8.0 rebounds across UCLAs two wins over Colorado. Colorado guard McKinley Wright IV led the Buffaloes in scoring and assists across the two matchups, averaging 17 points and 4.5 assists, with his assists making up more than half of his teams total across both encounters.  Colorados Feb. 22 loss to UCLA started a season-long losing streak, a four-game skid it will carry into the Pac-12 tournament.   No. 7 seed Stanford (20-11, 9-9 Pac-12)  MVP: Oscar da Silva Most Interesting Stat: 48.9% of field goal attempts near rim (No. 1 in NCAA) Pac-12 Championship Odds: 16-to-1  [caption id=""attachment_377102"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Like the Bruins, the Cardinals tournament hopes rely on their performance in the Pac-12 tournament.  Joe Lunardi has Stanford as one of the ""Last Four In"" and UCLA as one of the ""Last Four Byes."" If the Cardinal manage to avoid the upset against the Golden Bears in the first round, their matchup against the Bruins could quite possibly decide which team gets to go dancing.  Stanford started the season 15-2 but lost seven of its next eight games. In the matchup against UCLA  the last game before the start of its skid  the Cardinal handed the Bruins their worst home loss in terms of point differential of the season. Guard Tyrell Terry dropped a career-high 24 points to lead Stanford to its first victory in Pauley Pavilion since 2005.  However, since that loss, UCLA has turned a new leaf, finishing its regular-season slate 11-3.  The Cardinal are the best team in the country at getting shots near the basket, taking 48.9% of their attempts from that region, according to Haslametrics. Redshirt sophomore forwards Jalen Hill and Cody Riley will have their hands full protecting the rim and guarding Stanfords leading scorer forward Oscar da Silva, who averages 16.1 points per game. The German big man heads into postseason play having scored 15 points or more in six of his last seven games.  Both teams are on different paths than they were on heading into their first meeting, and the stakes could not be higher if they match up once again Thursday evening.   No. 8 seed Oregon State (17-13, 7-11 Pac-12)  MVP: Tres Tinkle Most Interesting Stat: Tres Tinkle, 2,214 career points (No. 1 in OSU history) Pac-12 Championship Odds: 80-to-1  [caption id=""attachment_377103"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""875""]  (Joe Akira/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  Oregon States all-time leading scorer could potentially be playing his last collegiate match ever in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament.  Forward Tres Tinkle is leading the team offensively, posting 18.4 points and 7.0 rebounds per game. He is also atop the Pac-12 in steals, averaging 1.8 takeaways per game.  Tinkle overtook Hall of Famer Gary Payton  who scored 2,172 points from 1987 to 1990  to become Oregon States all-time leading scorer against Stanford on March 5. Coach Wayne Tinkle gave his son the game ball after the match to commemorate the occasion in a father-son bonding moment in the locker room.  Tres Tinkle has helped the team reach 42nd in adjusted offensive efficiency according to KenPom.com, but its adjusted defensive efficiency lags behind at 158th in the country.  In the lone meeting between the two schools, UCLA edged Oregon State 62-58, buoyed by 11 points in 19 minutes by guard Jules Bernard  one of the sophomores three double-digit scoring outings in conference play.  The Beavers do a great job protecting the basketball, averaging 11.6 turnovers per game, best in the conference.  Despite Tres Tinkles heroics for the Beavers, they seem doomed for an early exit playing No. 9 seed Utah in the first round and then No. 1 seed Oregon if they advance. Wayne Tinkle could not rely on his son to save the team from two separate four-game losing streaks in conference play.   No. 9 seed Utah (16-14, 7-11 Pac-12)  MVP: Timmy Allen Most Interesting Stat: 14.2 free throw attempts allowed per game (No. 1 in Pac-12) Pac-12 Championship Odds: 80-to-1  [caption id=""attachment_377104"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Tanmay Shankar/Assistant Photo editor)[/caption]  In the early going, the Utes appeared to be a formidable team  but that was before they began to stumble in conference play.  Utah had nonconference wins over Kentucky, Minnesota and BYU on its resume. However, its last game before Pac-12 play  an 80-52 loss to No. 6 San Diego State  was perhaps a foreshadowing of more losses to come.  Eventually finishing ninth in the league, Utah lost every road game against conference opponents while posting a 7-2 record in Salt Lake City. Although they wont have to play any more true road games, the Utes have not won outside of their home state since Dec. 18, so stringing together wins in neutral territory might be difficult to do.  Forward Timmy Allen is the offensive catalyst for the Utes, finishing fifth in the conference in scoring with 17.5 points per game.  However, a sleeper pick for the Utes most important player in its possible title run is guard Both Gach. The sophomore had 28 points in the victory against Colorado and averages 11 points per game to keep the team afloat if Allen rests.  Utah will be matched up with Oregon State in its first-round matchup after splitting the regular-season series with the Beavers.  In the event that Utah breaks through its side of the bracket to face UCLA in the finals, the Bruins should be confident in coming out with a win. Cronins squad was one of two teams that was able to beat Utah twice and were the only team to beat the Utes by double digits at the Jon M. Huntsman Center.   No. 10 seed California (13-18, 7-11 Pac-12)  MVP: Matt Bradley Most Interesting Stat: 61.3 points per game (No. 12 in Pac-12) Pac-12 Championship Odds: 80-to-1  [caption id=""attachment_377105"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Kanishka Mehra/Assistant Photo editor)[/caption]  California will end its season in Las Vegas barring a miracle run to the Pac-12 championship.  Standing in the way of the Golden Bears chances is their road/neutral site record, which stands at 1-13, compared to a 12-5 home slate in Berkeley.  The biggest obstacle for California is its lack of shooting. The Bears are last in the conference in points scored per game, 3-pointers made and 3-pointers attempted.  The Bears guard Matt Bradley was the only player on the squad to average more than 10 points per game, and the sophomore plays on a team where the leader in assists  guard Paris Austin  averages 2.5 assists per game.  The low-scoring nature of the offense led to some of the Bears struggles on the road, as California only broke 60 points in two of its nine conference road games this year. Additionally, they were twice held to 45 points or less.  California will face UCLA in the second round should it progress that far. In the teams lone game this year, a defensive battle ended with the Bruins on top 50-40. Given coach Mick Cronins focus on defense and the woeful shooting from California, expect another defensive-focused game if these two meet.  California will open up tournament play versus its rival Stanford, a team with which they split the season series, with each team winning its home matchup. However, the Bears scored 52 points exactly in each contest, so holding the Cardinal under that number should be the goal.  If they cant, the Bears season will come to an early  but unsurprising  conclusion.   No. 11 seed Washington State (15-16, 6-12 Pac-12)  MVP: CJ Elleby Most Interesting Stat: 73.5 points allowed per game (No. 12 in Pac-12) Pac-12 Championship Odds: 80-to-1  [caption id=""attachment_377106"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  While their conference performance has seen more success than their in-state rivals, the Cougars have alternated between hot and cold.  Washington State started the season 3-4, falling to non-Power Five teams including Omaha and Colorado State. Within conference play, Washington State is currently 2-1 against the top two teams in the Pac-12, with its loss to UCLA coming by just three points in Westwood  However, it was swept by Arizona, Stanford, California and Utah, which currently sit between fifth and tenth in the league.  Much of the Cougars offense runs through forward CJ Elleby. The sophomore currently ranks fourth in points per game and seventh in total rebounds in the conference. When teams are able to lock Elleby down, the Cougars can turn to guard Isaac Bonton, who is the only other Cougar to average more than 15 points per game.  The Bruins and Cougars have played two tight games this season, with both contests needing an extra period to determine a winner. The home team prevailed on each of those occasions. But at a neutral site, neither time will be able to rely on the home faithful to fuel them in crunch time.  Bonton led Washington State in scoring during both matchups versus UCLA, scoring 40 points across 79 minutes played in the two games. The Bruins ability to contain Bonton and force the Cougars to go to other offensive options will determine the fate of the two squads should they meet in the semifinals.   No. 12 seed Washington (15-16, 5-13 Pac-12)  MVP: Isaiah Stewart Most Interesting Stat: First place in Pac-12 in 2018-2019, last place in 2019-2020 Pac-12 Championship Odds: 100-to-1  [caption id=""attachment_377107"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Washington added two freshmen projected to go in the first round of this years NBA Draft, yet somehow plummeted from the top of the Pac-12 last season to the bottom this year.  The two freshmen  forwards Isaiah Stewart and Jaden McDaniels  are leading the Huskies in scoring. Stewart is third in the conference in rebounds and blocks per game and sixth in field goal percentage.  Behind Stewarts 7-foot, 4-inch wingspan, coach Mike Hopkins has put together a menacing defense, leading the Pac-12 in blocks at 6.1 per game  more than a full block more than second-place Oregon State  and ranking 32nd in adjusted defensive efficiency, according to KenPom.com.  However, the teams heavy reliance on the two freshmen hurt them in clutch situations, as the team went 2-10 in games decided by two possessions or less. Both games between the Huskies and the Bruins were closely contested.  In UCLAs Pac-12 opener, the Bruins eked out a 66-64 victory that was a one-possession game for the final 15 minutes. In the next meeting, UCLA overcame a seven-point halftime deficit to sweep the regular-season series.  Washington has a rough tournament schedule, facing No. 5 seed Arizona for an opportunity to play No. 4 seed USC in the quarterfinals and then potentially No. 1 seed Oregon in the semifinals.  With UCLA positioned on the other side of the bracket, it is unlikely that the two teams paths will collide again this season.","['cap-dylan-dsouza', 'cap-jack-perez']","['mens-basketball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/preview.png

Protests across LA County started Friday after the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody.    The curfew originally lasted from 6 p.m. on Sunday to 6 a.m. on Monday.&nbsp;    Kathryn Barger, the chair of the LA County Board of Supervisors, said she enacted the curfew to preserve public order and safety in an executive order.&nbsp;    The curfew order does not apply to credentialed media, people experiencing homelessness, individuals seeking medical care, people traveling for business purposes and law enforcement, including the National Guard and military personnel.    Those who violate the curfew will receive a misdemeanor, which is punishable by a fine up to $1,000, and up to six months in jail.    Barger also announced a local emergency because of the protests. This is the second local emergency this year, after LA County officials declared a local emergency March in response to the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;    LA Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a curfew in the city of Los Angeles from 8 p.m. on Sunday to 5:30 a.m. on Monday.    The Los Angeles County curfew supersedes Garcettis curfew and all other local curfews in the County of Los Angeles that are less stringent than the countys.   Los Angeles County reinstated the curfew Monday from 6 p.m. through 6 a.m. Tuesday.  The County further extended the curfew Tuesday morning from 6 p.m. on Tuesday through 6 a.m. on Wednesday.  Los Angeles County extended the curfew for the fourth day, from 9 p.m. on Wednesday to 5 a.m. on Thursday.  Citywide curfews in Santa Monica and Beverly Hills were announced Monday morning.  The curfew in both Beverly Hills and Santa Monica began June 1 starting at 1 p.m. in business districts, and at 4 p.m. for the rest of the city.  The Beverly Hills curfew extended through 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday. However, LA Countys curfew supersedes local curfews that are less stringent.  Beverly Hills has reinstated its curfew from 1 p.m. on Tuesday to 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday.  Santa Monica will also reinstate its curfew from 2 p.m. on Tuesday to 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

Since mid-March, the Asian Pacific Policy &amp; Planning Council and its partners have received around 1,500  reports  of anti-Asian harassment.  Hate crimes  are on the rise. And, according to  NBC , federal agencies are doing little about it.  It's horrifying, but hardly surprising, that the president is now calling COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus,"" adding to the stereotyping of Asian Americans.      What's more surprising is when that hateful rhetoric comes from campus.  Stephen Bainbridge, a professor of law at UCLA, took to Twitter to post statements accusing some of his Chinese students of harboring the virus, sparking outrage among the student body and leading to an  apology  on his blog. His tweets not only  perpetuate  xenophobia and encourage racist stereotypes, but also violate the UCLA Faculty Code of Conduct.  So where national officials have failed to guide discourse without stereotyping, UCLA's administration has an opportunity to set the record straight.     UCLA must proactively   take better action to protect victims of hate crimes and discrimination on campus once school begins again. Adding two lines to the end of emails condemning xenophobia is simply not enough. But most importantly, we need a legislative systemic change to repair the racial and economic disparities that continuously disadvantage   minorities.  Even on a diverse campus like UCLA's, the pandemic has caused concerns among the student body regarding discrimination.  Amy Ho, the civic engagement coordinator for UCLA's Asian Pacific Coalition and a third-year political science student, said xenophobic comments have affected Asian Americans, and she does not know if there is an immediate solution in sight when national leadership emulates the same behavior.  ""Trump made a half-hearted comment saying how he doesn't condone racism or violence against Asian Americans,"" Ho said. ""I think that the damage is already done  this is deeply rooted racism and xenophobia that has massed itself for the past few decades.""  And   Asians and Asian Americans are at the  forefront  of battling COVID-19 and searching for a vaccine, despite the surge in xenophobia.     But Asian Americans are not alone in being victims of discrimination related to the coronavirus.  African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. According to a  survey  by Johns Hopkins University, African Americans made up 73% of deaths in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, where the population is only 26% black.  The Washington Post  explained how counties with a black majority, in comparison to white majority, experience three times the rate of infections and nearly six times the rate of deaths.  Black Americans and women of color constitute a large portion of essential workers. Their low-wage, essential jobs displace them in poorer, overcrowded and often segregated neighborhoods with  lower-quality health care  than wealthier areas, causing communities of color to disproportionately suffer.  And it seems that UCLA might not have its students' best interests in mind when it comes to health care. UCLAs Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center is responsible for providing medical care to UCLAs students; however students who waive the UC Student Health Insurance Plan and choose to stick with the insurance they already have are forced to pay additional fees for health visits. UCLA is not making it any easier for economically challenged students to receive the health care they need on campus.  In addition to suffering from lack of health care, individuals from low-income populations may struggle to stock up on basic needs and sanitary products. In fact,  78%  of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and consequently, cannot afford to hoard items on the same level as many wealthier, and often white, Americans.  Those who can afford health care reap the benefits of treatment. Those who cannot, dont.  This cycle will surely impact students at UCLA. And without proactive education about xenophobia, accessible basic needs resources and increased access to health care at lower prices, underrepresented students will be hit doubly hard by the ugly divisions of this virus upon returning to campus.  Alexandria Davis, a fourth-year African American studies and political science student and chairperson for the Afrikan Student Union at UCLA, an organization that represents the social, cultural and political interests of black students and faculty, explains the feedback loop that keeps minorities disadvantaged.  The coronavirus has revealed racial disparities as well as economic disparitiesand how they are often linked,"" Davis   said.  "" People of color are more likely to be essential workers that put (themselves) at increased risk of getting the coronavirus and create a violent cycle.""  Though UCLA has tried to navigate this crisis and condemn xenophobia, the administration clearly has other priorities than supporting its marginalized studentsand lack a sense of urgency in doing so. In mass emails to Bruins, there is no information about support if you have been discriminated against, nor any word of action the university is taking to protect heavily affected minorities.  &nbsp;  UCLA needs to begin the conversation on the reality of xenophobia on its campus and how we, as a country, can prevent such egregious consequences for historically disadvantaged groups.  The nation is a long way from solving its racial inequalities  this pandemic only emphasizes that.  But for UCLA, that change can start much closer to home.",['cap-lauren-bui'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.campusclose.lk_.jpg

The junior guard for UCLA mens basketball declared for the 2020 NBA Draft early Tuesday morning, ESPNs Jonathan Givony reported. Smith is coming off a career year with the Bruins, in which he led the team in scoring and set personal bests across the board.  Smith is the first Bruin to enter the draft pool this offseason, and he was the only one expected to consider making the leap this spring. It is unclear whether Smith hired an agent or chose to retain his eligibility for the time being.  Smith is considered to be a potential second-round pick and is ranked No. 72 in ESPNs Top 100.  While individual predraft workouts would usually start in early-to-mid-April, this years process is going to be a little different.  The NBA notified its teams Monday they cannot conduct any in-person tryouts for the time being as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The NBA Draft Combine, which was scheduled to start May 21, is also unlikely to proceed, but teams are permitted to hold virtual interviews with prospects. They cannot watch live online workouts, however.  With no workouts or showcases on the horizon, Smiths final season in Westwood will serve as the biggest source of film for interested pro scouts.  Smith did not miss a game during his UCLA career, and he saw his playing time increase for the 2019-2020 season. Smith was averaging 5.1 points and 2.8 rebounds in 16.3 minutes per game entering his junior year, all while shooting 41.8% from the field, 24.7% from deep and 65.5% from the free throw line.  This season, Smith bumped those numbers up to 13.1 points and 5.4 rebounds in 28.3 minutes per game on 45.8% shooting from the field, a 34.1% clip from 3 and an 84.0% mark from the charity stripe. Smiths production boost was enough to earn him the Pac-12 Most Improved Player Award of the Year and a spot on the All-Pac-12 First Team.  With Smith gone, the Bruins will have rising sophomores Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Jake Kyman, as well as rising juniors David Singleton and Jules Bernard, heading up the wing rotation in 2020-2021. Incoming four-star freshman guard Jaylen Clark will likely be fighting for Smiths minutes as well.  Smith still has one year of collegiate eligibility remaining should he decide to return to UCLA before the June 3 withdrawal deadline.  The NBA Draft is currently still scheduled for June 25, but teams have also been told to prepare for that date to change.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['mens-basketball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/IMG_6661.jpg

While some of the destinations may be viable for travel by the start of the programs, IEO said there may be consequences from the measures taken to stop the spread of the disease.  Due to the recent elevation to pandemic status by the World Health Organization, we feel the best course of action is to suspend now in hopes of reducing financial risk to you as a student as well as to allow you time to consider alternate options for summer plans, the email read.

I remember him kneading dough on our kitchen counter as I watched on my tiptoes at 5 years old. I remember when his hands  aged with callouses that carried an endless history  enveloped my own and walked me home from kindergarten. Those hands taught me the order of operations and filled out countless sudoku charts. It was those hands I saw for the last time, when I visited him March 16 to finally learn the recipes for the dishes he made that I loved so much growing up.  That was the day before San Jose, California, went on a countywide lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus. My family made the trip to drop off a box of N95 masks for my grandparents, who live with my aunt and uncle. My grandfather was already coughing a little bit that day, but a cough was still just a cough back then  not a death sentence. When I hugged my grandfather goodbye, I fully believed that I would see him again when the quarantine was over.   ""I remember my grandfather's hands the most.""     Except, the next day, my uncle called and told us that a week ago, when they made a trip to Los Angeles, they stayed with a friend who had just tested positive for COVID-19. My house fell silent as we all absorbed the implications of what this meant  a two-week long period of self-isolation and a real possibility that we would lose both of my grandparents.  But while I expected the heavy silence and fear from my younger family members, I didnt expect for my phone to blow up. I received texts and calls from aunts, uncles and cousins that I normally talk to only once or twice a year for birthday wishes and holidays.  For the next two weeks, the coronavirus pandemic emptied the outside world of all its liveliness while unrest ruled over my family.  My grandparents were quickly admitted into the emergency room at the Washington Hospital Healthcare System after showing signs of a fever, and my aunt and uncle who took care of them were also tested for the virus. Within a day, my grandfather tested positive.  Forty-eight hours later, he was hooked onto a ventilator.  The virus became a horrifying reality for my family. Every update my uncle sent over our family group chat was another shock of anxiety. And as the only person in my household with a smart phone, I became the unwanted bearer of bad news. Pretty soon, I muted all of my notifications except for the group chat because every buzz put my father on edge.  My father also developed a cough during this time, yet he seemed ready to leave the house at any moment to run to my grandfathers side. I began making sure he fell asleep before I went to bed, in case he ran out the door in the middle of the night. It was moments like those that made me realize how painful this was for my family.  When my mom's father passed away, she was able to hop on a plane to Taiwan within three hours of the news. This time around, 19 members of my family scattered throughout the U.S. and Europe were desperate to move  but couldnt.  The inevitable update came March 25, when my grandfather, a 91-year-old man with hardly any preexisting conditions, passed away from the coronavirus.  In many ways, my family is lucky. My grandmother tested negative, my uncle and aunt contracted a relatively mild case of the virus, and the hospital they went to had available healthcare workers, tests and ventilators. There were mortuaries and funeral homes to turn to when my grandfather passed, and we're even able to live stream his cremation. I know these are luxuries that are out of reach to others struggling with the virus  those who live in areas where their hospitals, morgues and funeral homes are all at capacity.   ""While I am isolated at home with my parents and two cousins, my grandfather spent his last days alone because he had to be isolated in the hospital.""     But what hurts the most with COVID-19 is knowing that, while I am isolated at home with my parents and two cousins, my grandfather spent his last days alone because he had to be isolated in the hospital, too. My uncle was the only one by his side when they pulled the ventilator out, and instead of saying goodbye, all I have left of my grandfather are secondslong videos taken in a sterile hospital room.  The effects of COVID-19 didnt stop there, either. It upended more than our everyday lives as it stole even my grandfathers plans after death. He and my grandmother, married for more than 70 years, wanted to be buried next to each other. But instead, my family was forced to make plans to cremate him in case his body is still infectious.  I remember these moments when I sit restless in my house on day ""whatever-it-is"" of quarantine. I remember my grandfathers hands each time I scrub furiously at my own, and I ignore every desire of mine to go outside, because, while I lost a loved one, there are still countless others who are vulnerable.  My grandfather was meant to die surrounded by his children, grandchildren and even his great-grandchildren. Instead, he died struggling for every breath, surrounded by strangers he didnt know.  I remember this as I wait to hug my grandmother, to share the grief with my family, to hold a funeral to celebrate my grandfathers life  and Im reminded of just how real this virus is and continues to be.

The count includes at least seven contractors from the Purple Line Extension project, a planned subway line connecting Westwood to Downtown LA. Metro has been keeping a  track record  of employees, contractors and vendors who have contracted the virus and has recorded one death since March 22.  Metro saw its first confirmed PLE case on April 21 coming from a contractor working at the Wilshire/Fairfax station. Six additional PLE contractors tested positive for COVID-19 on May 1, including another one from Wilshire/Fairfax. Dave Sotero, a Metro representative, said that the projects  expedited timeline  remains unaffected by the pandemic.  In light of mounting cases, Sotero said Metro has seen a 70 percent drop in ridership which would contribute to estimated losses between 700 to 800 million dollars. Metros fundings for projects like the Purple Line Extension will also be impacted from a decrease in fares and sales tax revenues, he added.  xOther expenses, such as cleaning services, have cost Metro millions of dollars, Metro CEO Phillip Washington said in an interview with  LAist .  Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act which was signed by the president on March 27, Metro will receive an estimated 710 to 810 million dollars for COVID-19 related expenses. Funding will be disbursed on a rolling basis starting late April.  Metro has followed a systematic approach to containing the spread of COVID-19 among employees. If testing comes back positive, Metro will immediately conduct an investigation to find any other employees that were in close contact with the infected person and instruct them to self-quarantine for 14 days.  LA county has also made testing available for  anybody  as of Apr 28.  Sotero did not share the status of the seven contractors or those who they were in close contact with, citing a confidentiality policy. Metro employees are abiding by  social distancing regulations  and continue to use personal protective equipment including face masks and shields, he added.  Sotero said Metro employees have been the backbone for lifeline travel around LA county.  Metro frontline workers are dedicated and heroic public servants, Sotero said. This grave public health crisis has taken an emotional toll on many of them. They deserve credit for doing their jobs during this difficult time.  Public works, including public transportation, are essential infrastructure sectors according to the LAs  safer-at-home orders . Within closure zones, Metros work hours run from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. everyday.  Employees are still receiving regular pay, despite anticipated losses and the sudden drop in ridership. Sotero said Washington plans to maintain the workforce without any layoffs.  Metro adjusted its transit schedules on Apr 19, running a modified Sunday service everyday of the week. This new schedule hopes to reduce the pandemics strain on the economy and maintain Metros workforce of around 11,000 employees. Modified transit schedules plan to efficiently accommodate reduced demand by providing more predictable service.  We are doing everything possible to ensure our operators and public travel as safely as possible during the COVID-19 outbreak while providing lifeline transit service for essential trips in LA County, Sotero said.",['cap-arif-abd-aziz'],"['los-angeles', 'news', 'transportation']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ns_.freevoterrides.file_.jpg

But that doesn't make it any less true.  UCLA Athletics officially announced Jarmond would head up the department Tuesday, locking him into a six-year contract that makes him one of the highest-paid athletics directors in the Pac-12 and the country. While the Bruins  broke the bank  to bring in the Boston College athletics director, Jarmond broke a barrier by becoming the first African American athletics director in the university's 101-year history.  There may not be any athletics for Jarmond to direct for the time being, but he still has a laundry list of concerns to address in the coming months.  Jarmond will inherit a department that ran a  $19 million deficit  in 2019 and was a central focus of the nationwide  college admissions scandal  earlier last year. UCLA football has finished below .500 for four seasons in a row  something it hadn't done since the 1920s  and both the football and men's basketball teams posted historically low attendance numbers this year.  To win back the fan base's interest and trust that slowly faded away throughout Athletics Director Dan Guerrero's 18-year tenure, UCLA needs fresh blood and a new perspective.  Luckily for the Bruin faithful, Jarmond checks off all the boxes.  The athletics director is certainly not as important to a team's on-the-field success as a coaching staff or players, but Jarmond's experience calling the shots for big-time football programs at Michigan State and Ohio State certainly doesn't hurt. He was part of the search team that made former BCS champion Urban Meyer a Buckeye in 2012 and he almost single-handedly recruited Jeff Hafley to fill the head coaching vacancy at Boston College in December.  UCLA football coach Chip Kelly does have three years left on his contract, so Jarmond won't have to conduct another search right off the bat. If or when the day comes that Kelly is kicked to the curb, however, Jarmond has shown that he knows exactly what he's doing in that realm.  Men's basketball just hired a new coach in Mick Cronin last year, and its 7-1 record down the stretch brought a buzz back to Pauley Pavilion, so Jarmond shouldn't be expected to overhaul anything on the hardwood. But with his background as a former mid-major men's basketball player at UNC Wilmington and position on the NCAA Division I Mens Basketball Oversight Committee, Jarmond should know just how to manage the Bruins on the court.  Jarmond has more tangible concerns than changing team cultures, however, starting with the dollars and cents behind it all.  UCLA Athletics operated in the red for the first time since 2004 last year, and a lot of that had to do with the combined $16.4 million spent on buying out both former men's basketball coach Steve Alford and former football coach Jim Mora in a 13-month span.  Solving the problem won't be rocket science for Jarmond, who got his MBA from Ohio University and established himself as one of the best fundraisers on the East Coast during his time at Boston College.  When he first arrived in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, Jarmond set his new department a five-year, $150 million fundraising goal he dubbed ""Greater Heights."" Corny, pun-based branding aside, Jarmond put donors' money where his mouth was and raised more than $108 million in less than three years on campus  the most ever raised by an ACC program.  A 39-year-old charismatic leader can take a program a long way, and capitalizing on the sheer scale and reach of the Wooden Athletic Fund should be one of Jarmond's top priorities. Another way to make back some money is a tactic Jarmond used to turn things around at Boston College  start selling alcohol in stadiums.  Jarmond organized Boston College's first fan council to overhaul the on-campus game day experience, and the conclusion was to open up beer and wine sales at football and basketball games that fall. A similar program could be in the pipeline for Jarmond at UCLA if he wants to boost fan interest and profits simultaneously.  Putting the economics aside, Jarmond has some major decisions to make in terms of his staff and the program's academics, both of which he seems fit to make.  UCLA released multiple statements following the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal claiming it would overhaul how it admits and evaluates student-athletes moving forward. Even with new policies  possibly in place , administrators who have been tied to similar situations  such as senior associate athletic director Josh Rebholz  still hold major positions of power.  Chancellor Gene Block and the rest of the team searching for Guerrero's successor knew enough to pass over Rebholz for the athletics director job, but Jarmond faces the tough decision of whether to keep him and other members of the old regime on his staff moving forward.   [Related:  Wangs Word: Athletic director will need to resolve department, conference and brand issues ]   Jarmond ran a tight ship on the academic side at Boston College, as 12 Eagles teams finished in the top decile of their sport in the multiyear Academic Progress Rate rankings in 2019  tied for third-most in the Football Bowl Subdivision. UCLA men's basketball's APR in 2019 placed them right on the cusp of a postseason ban, meaning there is a lot of room for improvement under Jarmond.  Finding the right balance between cleaning house and retaining familiarity behind the scenes is a tall task, but one Jarmond will have to grapple with immediately.  He has the right background, the right tools and the right ideas that can help take UCLA Athletics back to its former heights.  All that remains to be seen now is whether he'll crumble under the pressure.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['athletics-news', 'sports', 'sports-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Frame-4.png

With the transition to online instruction in response to COVID-19, many graduation photoshoots have been canceled, leading alumna Murry Soriano to take   commissions for illustrations of the soon-to-be graduates on the UCLA Free &amp; For Sale page on Facebook. Soriano said although she graduated two years ago, she began   illustrating by gifting graduation portraits to her close friends who still attend UCLA. With the ongoing pandemic  , she said she felt the need to offer her work to all seniors to help capture their bittersweet final moments at UCLA.  When I found out that a lot of UCLA students wouldn't have the opportunity to walk the stage, I realized that I took my opportunity to walk the stage two years ago for granted, Soriano said. I didnt realize how important that was for me when I did it.   [Related:    UCLA moves spring graduation ceremonies online to curb spread of COVID-19   ]     So far, Soriano said about 36 students have expressed interest in her graduation illustration commissions. When a student reaches out to her, Soriano asks that they send a few reference photos and choose options ranging from half-body illustrations to those including multiple people, she said.       With the current stay-at-home order in place, fourth-year political science student Justin Ambrosio said   it was inevitable traditional photoshoots on campus would be sacrificed. He said to combat this he requested one of Sorianos illustrations to showcase his achievements despite his last quarter of college taking place online. In addition to the illustration route making it easier to practice social distancing, Ambrosio said he also wanted to support the creation of art during the current state of uncertainty and anxiety in the world.  I honestly appreciate it because (the illustrations) show the importance of the fine arts, especially in a time like right now, where were all practicing social distancing, Ambrosio said. These artists are also giving students like myself the ability to celebrate their accomplishments in a form for everyone to see.  Although seniors do not have the luxury to do in-person graduation photoshoots anymore, he said online illustrations still provide the perks of creative originality. Ambrosio provided the artist with seven full-body photos for reference, and made sure to include photos from different angles. He said he chose photos he felt most confident about in order to capture his best features in the final illustration.   Soriano said to cater to her customers' specific visions she allows them to choose every detail of their photos, including props, facial expressions, outfits and backgrounds.   [Related:    Graduate student exhibition highlights innovative works utilizing various media   ]   She also collaborates with her customers to ensure every detail is the way they want it. After examining the reference photos he had sent her, Ambrosio said Soriano noticed his arms were consistently crossed in every one of them, and drew him with the same pose. Throughout the process of her work, Soriano notes these patterns and sends her customers rough sketches and drafts, along with questions in order to gauge their satisfaction, Ambrosio said.  In one instance, Soriano said one of her customers, who is currently a masters student, wrote her thesis on boba. Soriano was asked to incorporate the drink into the students graduation illustration, so the final product showed the bubble tea drink placed in the student's hand. In the same vein, Ambrosio said he took advantage of the personalization aspect by asking Soriano to customize his outfit to incorporate his Filipino heritage.  In my illustration, Im wearing a barong, which is a traditional Filipino garment only worn for really special occasions, Ambrosio said. I told her to put that in because graduation is so important to me, and I wanted to tie that in with my culture.    In the period between canceling their photoshoots and commissioning an illustration, some students were disappointed the time planning for photos had been lost. Fourth-year international development studies student Valerie Gan said she had already bought dresses and mapped out ideas in anticipation for her photoshoot in spring quarter. However, amid a global pandemic, Soriano's illustrations have provided students the opportunity to have this experience within a different medium, Gan said.  ""It made me feel like I kind of had a photoshoot,"" Gan said. ""Most people post their graduation photos around this time, and even though I wasnt able to physically take my pictures, I was still able to post my own in a different way.""    It is evident illustrations do not have the same effect real-life photos have, because of the absence of in-person experiences and memories. However, seniors who have lost a great chunk of their college experience have found comfort in Soriano's illustrations. When reminiscing on the times that could have been spring quarter, students are able to fill that void by creating exactly what they've missed out on, Soriano said.  ""Ive received a lot of emails from students who were really happy to have another opportunity to do their grad portraits,"" Soriano said. ""Even though its small, (those messages) make me want to help out and capture the last bits of their college experience for them.""",['cap-julie-lee'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ae_.gradillos.ALK_.jpg

The protest attracted thousands and started peacefully in Pan Pacific Park in response to police brutality.    The Black Lives Matter movement organized the protests in response to the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis after an officer kept his knee on Floyds neck for nearly nine minutes while arresting him.    The protest against police brutality was one of several in Los Angeles   and among many nationally across cities including Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle and New York.    We're living in the middle of an uprising, said Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement. We are uprising not just for black deaths. ... We are rising for black life.    Many of the chants demanded to hold police officers accountable, prosecute officers who kill and defund the police.    We need you to remember that there is power that we each have individually, but that grows exponentially when were all together, said Melina Abdullah, a protester who spoke at the event.    Victims of police brutality also spoke at the protest before it became violent.    Fouzia Almarou, the mother of Kenneth Ross Jr., who was fatally shot by police officers after he attempted to evade arrest in 2018, said her son was unarmed and ran from the police out of fear, and the officer who shot her son was not prosecuted.    You have no idea what I go through every day without my son, but I know what we do, we fight, Almarou said.    After about an hour of speeches, protesters began marching and heading northwest until they were met by the police.    It is unclear who started the confrontation between the protesters and police.    At least two police cars were lit on fire around Fairfax and Rosewood Avenues by protesters who smashed the car windows and ignited the patrol cars.    When the Los Angeles Fire Department and LAPD arrived at the scene, they formed a line around   a   burnt car using guns with rubber bullets. After some confrontations with the protesters, the officers started getting into cars to retreat west. The protesters proceeded to chase down these police cars, successfully breaking a couple of their windows.   [caption id=""attachment_384514"" align=""alignleft"" width=""620""]  Protesters set at least two police cars on fire in West Hollywood after tensions flared at a protest against police brutality. (Jintak Han/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]   Throughout the confrontation, some protesters tried to hold back attacks against the police. Several of them peeled off people who were dashing toward the police. A woman jumped in front of the police line to try to stop people from throwing things at the officers.    Around 4:35 p.m., the police returned to the protest. Officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas on protesters, who retreated north.    The LAPD declared the protest an unlawful assembly around 5:30 p.m.      Riot police arrived at the protests around 5:30 p.m., while police sheriffs arrived with AR-15 assault rifles around 7:30 p.m.    In response, protesters spread out and started heading north sporadically. Lootings started on Melrose Avenue and spread through the entirety of the street despite police presence. Many protesters did not participate in the looting, while others attempted to mitigate the violence.    At the protest, police repeatedly fired rubber bullets at the crowd, including members of the media. One person was shot in the eye. A journalist was punched in the stomach by an officer.    Jarett Conner, who attended the protest, said he was holding up a sign when police started shooting rubber bullets at him. Justin Tanga, another protester at the event, then ran in front of him to shield him from the bullets, he said.    Ive never had a man do that for me, Conner said. The special thing about it was that hes white. Hes white so he heard my silence, he heard my cries, and he said he had enough.    LAPD Police Chief Michel Moore said they tried to facilitate a safe and peaceful demonstration, but was disappointed they were unable to maintain it.    Im saddened by this continued inability to express ourselves and our discourse in a manner that does not endanger public safety, he said.    In response to the city-wide protests, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti    instituted one-day curfew    citywide between 8 p.m. on Saturday and 5:30 a.m. on Sunday. People traveling between work, people seeking emergency medical care and emergency responders are exempt from the curfew.    Right now, it is so critical for us to reestablish the peace in this city, so that we can do that work and have those conversations, he said in a press conference Saturday.    Whether the curfew will be extended remains unknown.    Members of the media are currently not exempt from the curfew, said LAPD representative Mike Chan.    Garcetti also announced Saturday he will deploy 500 to 700 California National Guard Troops to enforce peace and safety.

Jarmond previously held the same position at Boston College and also spent time in Ohio State and Michigan State's athletics departments.    With the COVID-19 epidemic canceling any in-person introductions, Sports editor Sam Connon spoke to Jarmond on the phone Tuesday morning to gauge where he stands as he starts his new job in Westwood.    Daily Bruin : After you got the call from Chancellor Gene Block and UCLA offering you the job, how long did it take for you to make up your mind? How tough was it to leave Boston College?   Martin Jarmond : It was very tough to leave BC. What we've accomplished over the last three years, in my opinion, is significant, and anytime that you pour your heart and soul into a place, it's hard to leave. So the people are great here at BC, I had a great relationship with my president, and so it was very tough to leave  it wasn't an easy decision. And it's not so much about the opportunity to UCLA, but it was just the work that we had done here at Boston College. But it was very tough, it was not easy. Again, with the opportunity that UCLA presented and the ability to lead and be a part of an elite, academic and athletic institution, you just can't pass that opportunity up.   DB : UCLA isn't even going to be the biggest school you've worked at  Ohio State's student population is nearly 70,000  but it is certainly bigger than Boston College. Do you think you have a unique blend of a big-school and small-school mindset that sets you up for success in Westwood?   MJ : You're always a product of your experiences. And I think the best part of of my experience and who I am is I've been in different situations that require you to understand different complexities with an institution, whether it's a private Catholic Jesuit institution in the Northeast, or whether is a land-grant institution like Michigan State University or Ohio State. You know, they're all different, but there are some similarities when it comes to some of the things you have to do day-in and day-out to be successful. So I'd like to think that my experiences will help me as I move forward and listen and learn and try to get a grasp of where we are as a program at UCLA and where we go.   DB : Do you have any UCLA apparel already, or are you going to wait until you get to campus?   MJ : They sent me some stuff the end of last week. So, you know, it's kind of a strange time, as you can imagine. This is my last week at BC. You're kind of doing two jobs and trying to close things out the right way, but also trying to get acclimated somewhat to UCLA during a pandemic while I'm here in Boston, and I'll be here for a while. So it's been an interesting last two weeks  fast paced, exciting  and I haven't gotten all the gear yet, but I'm certainly sure that I'll be wearing some here shortly.   DB : UCLA just celebrated its centennial in 2019, and those first 100 years resulted in 118 NCAA championships. How do you plan on making the Bruins a power in the next 100 years, as opposed to just being a program focused on legacy and the past?   MJ : Well, I think UCLA has such a storied tradition  championships a number of student-athletes that have gone on to be leaders and legends in their own right. I mean, that's significant success at the highest level. I think for me, I have to get there and learn and listen  listen to the coaches, the staff, the donors, the alumni  to get a better grasp of where we are and what we need to do moving forward. So it's hard when you haven't fully gotten too into a job before you can say, ""I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that."" I think the best thing you can do is really study the past, study the history, understand the legacy, understand the success, understand the challenges. As you assess those and look at that and you learn and listen to people that have been really entrenched into UCLA culture and the everyday rhythm of what we're trying to do, then I think you can better assess, and then make a plan going forward as far as strategically, how are we going to advance our athletics program? Because you always got to be about advancement. And so it's just about learning the way the best way to go about that.   DB : At the same time, the trailblazers and dynasties that have called UCLA home will always be important to the school's brand. Are there any specifically that you grew up watching or admiring, or still impact you personally to this day?   MJ : Well, the success has been tremendous UCLA. Growing up, obviously, coach (John) Wooden and the basketball program is right there as the basketball program. I played college basketball so if you're a basketball player, you know about UCLA's storied success and tradition in basketball. But there's so many other sports that have been great. Softball, for example, I remember seeing a documentary ""Between the White Lines"" when I was a young staffer at Michigan State and I saw coach Sue Enquist and that team go on to win the championship. And I remember just being in awe of coach Enquist and what the UCLA softball program was able to accomplish and, obviously, that's continued on with Kelly (Inouye-Perez). There's so many programs and I don't want to list them all because I don't want to forget anyone, I'm still fresh to the job. But growing up, you just know UCLA is success, it's elite. And my job is to maintain our elite level and even push it further than where we are. And we got some work to do and I'm excited about that.   DB : So you're only 40 years old, which means UCLA's current football, men's basketball, women's basketball and gymnastics coaches are all older than you, among others. You were in a similar situation at BC, so what impact do you think the age discrepancy has on your relationships with your coaches, if any?   MJ : I don't really think it plays a role. I've been young, professionally, all my life, as far as jobs and opportunities that I've had. Relationships, it's about people, it's about respect, and as long as we have a respect level, there's candor and trust and transparency, I don't think your age matters. You know, what I want our coaches to know is I'm going to do everything I can to help put them in a position to be successful. And that means provide resources or advice, but it also means asking tough questions. That's my job as an athletic director  (it) is to help them reach their potential and help our student-athletes reach their best potential. So I don't think age comes into play when it comes to building a relationship. I think you have to meet people where they are, you have to understand, have a level of empathy, and I hope to demonstrate that with our coaches.   DB : Being so young for an AD, do you think that has helped you connect with athletes and students better than the average AD?   MJ : Yes, I think I absolutely think it helps you with the student-athletes. It's interesting, from an age standpoint, the closer you are to it, I think the better you're able to understand and communicate. You have to meet students where they are and I do think that gives me an advantage over someone that maybe is not as close to this generation as far as understanding how they communicate, how they operate, what's important to them and what matters. So I do think that helps me, you'd have to ask student-athletes that I interact with if it does, but I would like to think that my age does help me in that realm for sure.   DB : At Boston College, you initiated the first-ever fan council and talked a lot about the importance of fan engagement. Attendance for UCLA men's basketball and football has been on a downward trend, so what are the first few steps to getting fans back on board, once coronavirus-related restrictions are lifted?   MJ : I have to look at it, I haven't been able to dive in yet, but that's something that I'm going to lean into heavily, student engagement and fan engagement. You know, the energy starts with the students, and I've heard The Den is a really passionate student fan base. So I'm excited to meet with their leadership  that's one of the first things that I'd like to do because I truly think that energy on a campus and at games starts with the students. And if you get the students going, and you understand what's important to them and get them more engaged and bought into what you're trying to do, then it kind of grows out exponentially to your fan base and then to the casual fan and then you've got something. So I'm excited about working with The Den and our students just to understand what are their challenges with coming to games and the ones that do come, why do they come? And what can we do to make it a better experience to make it easier and more entertaining for them to come to games? I think you have to listen to your fans, I think you have to listen to your students, and that's why I believe in the fan council that we created (at Boston College). You've got to be in tune with your fan base and your students, you have to be engaged. And to me, that's the only way to operate.   DB : One of the bigger changes you made at Boston College was bringing alcohol to Alumni Stadium and Conte Forum, and that was in a state with pretty strict liquor license regulations. Is selling beer and wine at Pauley Pavilion and the Rose Bowl something you would like to get done during your tenure?   MJ : I haven't had any conversations about that. It was the right move for BC at the time and we determined that through the work we did with our fan council. I really leaned into learning and understanding what our fans wanted, but also the political dynamic with beer and wine and what all that entails in the city. So that was a separate situation, I think in situation when you when you're talking about alcohol, you really have to look at where it is and all the dynamics that go into play and whether you want to provide that to your fans or not. So for me, that's premature. Again, I haven't gotten there and I haven't learned and listened to see what are the opportunities, what are the challenges as far as alcohol sales? That's not something I'm focused on right now, I'm really just focused on closing out here, and then learning and listening a lot once I get there.   DB : UCLA Athletics ran a $19 million deficit last year  is that something that has either intimidated or motivated you in your early days on the job?   MJ : No, I'm aware of the deficit and the carryover. But at the end of the day, every athletic department has challenges, especially now in this environment, with COVID-19, there are financial pressures on every athletic department. So that's no different than any other (school) across the country. As far as UCLA, I'm aware of it, but I haven't really leaned in yet to understand the true dynamics and what are the projections and different things like that, so I'm looking forward to doing that. That's obviously a challenge, but it's a challenge that I'm willing to face head on.   DB : Ohio State won the Rose Bowl in your first year as a Buckeye  does the stadium hold any special place in your heart, and is it going to be surreal to have it as your home football field?   MJ : Surreal, absolutely. The first time I ever was in the Rose Bowl, it was amazing, it was picturesque. The sun setting, the feel of being in the Rose Bowl, it's just iconic. So I have to pinch myself to think that I'll be able to go to the Rose Bowl for our home games. It is truly, really cool. I never imagined myself being in the Rose Bowl so many times, and so now it's just amazing to think about.   DB : I know you told the Los Angeles Times that you've already talked to UCLA football coach Chip Kelly since you've been hired. I know the college football seasons is a little up in the air right now  in terms of how many games are played and where  but what would you say your expectations are for the team both this year and in the future?   MJ : First and foremost  I've had one conversation with Chip (Kelly) and I'm looking forward to working with him  anytime you come into a new situation, you have to assess, you have to listen and learn. And so as far as my expectations, I have to learn where we are as a program, how we stack up with the rest of the conference, I have to learn from Chip, what our strengths and opportunities for improvement are. So I can't give you an answer as far as what my expectations are until I learn more about our football program and the Pac-12, quite frankly. So I'm excited, I'm excited about learning that and really leaning into football, because obviously, it's very important to us for many reasons, and I'm excited about that working with Chip and working with the staff to get going.   DB : Coming from a basketball background yourself, what do you think about the state of UCLA men's basketball under Cronin?   MJ : I wasn't following team during the season, I am aware that Mick and the team finished strong, I think 11 out of the last 14, maybe a basket away from winning the Pac-12. So in his first season, I think that's phenomenal progress, the way they closed. I'm excited to work with Mick, I didn't know Mick before this, but I've heard good things about him. I know that his team to Cincinnati were known for toughness, playing defense and playing the right way, and he was a winner. So I'm excited to work with him. And UCLA basketball obviously has such a storied tradition and history, to be a part of that is going to be special.   DB : Have you reached out to Cronin yet?   MJ : Yes, yes, I've reached out to Mick and spoke with him, we had a great conversation. He seems like he's got an easy, easy personality to get along with, I enjoyed our conversation.   DB : Did your guys' shared Ohio connection come up at all?   MJ : Well his dad was a longtime high school coach in Cincinnati, (Ohio), so we were talking about Ohio a little bit on the phone. And I think his dad was a was a scout for the Atlanta Braves, and I grew up rooting for the Braves too, so we talked a little bit about the Braves in the '80s and '90s.   DB : Ohio State beat Cincinnati in the 2012 Sweet 16 when you were in Columbus, (Ohio), and Cronin was in Cincinnati  do you still remember that game, and was that something that came up during your call?   MJ : I did not know that, that did not come up. Now I've got something on him. I'm glad you told me that, I was not aware of that.   DB : Only a handful of UCLA's 118 national championships have come from the two revenue sports, while teams like men's volleyball, gymnastics, baseball and softball have been national powers for decades. Have you had any conversations with the other head coaches on campus?   MJ : I'm working through all of our coaches. Again, I'm still doing two jobs and I want to remind our Bruin faithful to hang in there as I transition, there's no manual as far as how you transition during a pandemic. So I've been kind of taking my time, I have talked to a few of the coaches on those sports, but not everybody. I will reach out to everybody at some point, but I kind of want to make sure I'm measured and doing things the right way to close out here at Boston College and then kind of take my time as I begin my tenure with UCLA.   DB : Due to coronavirus, we're not really sure where and when fall sports will be able to start. Have you had any discussions about that at UCLA and have they been different from any preparations you may have been making at Boston College?   MJ : I have not been privy to the conversations at UCLA or the Pac-12 regarding fall sports yet. I'm looking forward to obviously leaning in and jumping in, working with Dan Guerrero to get up to speed, as far as where we are. But I haven't had any conversations about that. I've been obviously involved in ACC conversations about returning in the fall in sports and returning to play in competition. But I'm looking forward to learning more about the Pac-12 and UCLA specifically.   DB : What do you think about the option of no fans in the stands and do you think it would be a difficult adjustment?   MJ : You'd have to ask them student-athletes. They practice and they have scrimmages without fans, so from that perspective, I don't think it would be totally foreign. However, there is a game-day element, a game-day aspect that fans bring energy, so you have to think about how that may impact the home team versus the visiting team. I think those are legitimate questions you have to think through, but we don't really have the answers. But at the end of the day, I think you want everyone to be healthy and safe and do it the right way. So it's not a decision, I don't think, that will come from me or Chip, it'll come from medical experts and people that are experts in this field in this area that give us guidance. So I'm hopeful, I'm an optimistic, positive person, and I'm hopeful for sports in the fall and competing again, because I know those young and young women, they want to compete, they want to play and that's important to them.   DB : Boston College locked down a contract with Under Armour in 2009, well before you got there, but do you have any kind of existing relationship with the UA executives that you think will carry over to your job at UCLA?   MJ : Oh, I do. I was excited about that, to see some of the information that I received about Under Armour. Some of the contacts listed for UCLA, they were the same contacts that I was working with here at Boston College, so those relationships will carry over.Under Armor has been great to me and great to BC, so I'm looking forward to continuing that relationship and seeing some old friends but on a different coast.   DB : You sponsored a Martin Jarmond collection of Under Armour apparel at Boston College last year  when can we expect the new, blue and gold edition to hit shelves in Westwood?   MJ : You know ... I can't give you everything ... . I can't give you everything. You're asking for all the answers to the test, man, you've got to wait a little bit. I can't give you everything the first time we talk, so I would tell you to stay tuned.   DB : I know you've said before that you want to have a little bit of an overlap with Dan Guerrero at UCLA before he officially retires. How has your relationship been with him over the past week or so?   MJ : Tremendous. Dan Guerrero is one of the best human beings I've ever known. He has been so gracious, so kind. It's so easy, I'm trying to make sure I do things in a way that he's comfortable and he feels the exact same way  he's trying to make sure I'm comfortable. So it creates a nice dynamic for a smooth transition, and so I'm excited about that. Because anytime you have a transition, it could go one of two ways  it can be positive or it can be negative or challenging. And I can tell you the way Dan has been, It helps that we've known each other for over a decade. He's been a legend in college athletics in our industry as someone with high integrity who everybody respects, and so I couldn't be more pleased with his approach and how he's been welcoming of me. It's been so nice and gracious as I kind of worked through my transition here coming to UCLA.   DB : On a more personal note, how has the move from Boston to Los Angeles been for you, considering you're heading out there with a family and during the COVID-19 pandemic?   MJ : Yes, it's been a challenge because you're doing everything virtual and I've never lived in LA or on the West Coast, so I'm trying to understand the nuance with (I)-405 traffic or the Valley. You hear phrases and you hear places you don't really have a grasp for. Some people in the UCLA community have reached out and everybody's been helpful, but it's really just trying to slow down and understand exactly  because Los Angeles is so big in the area  what are some places that may be best suited for where I want to live and be able to get to campus quickly, but also enjoy our personal space and personal life. So it's best been a process, it's just going to continue to be one of those things that I've just got to learn and talk to people and try to get a better grasp on the LA area.   DB : How much are you looking forward to in-person introductions, whether it's with UCLA administration, the fans or the media, once that is permitted?   MJ : I'm looking forward to that moment. I think all of us are waiting for the ability to get back, to see and connect with each other. But for me being the new guy, I'm looking forward to just learning and meeting my new teammates and coaches and staff and everybody in the UCLA community. I'm excited about that, it's something that I wake up thinking about, and I just can't wait to get started. And it's going to be a process because we don't know exactly when I'm going to even move or when we're going to be back to work. But I do know I'm excited to work with the team and I'm excited to serve our student-athletes and get to know them and our coaches. It's just been a blessing and a great opportunity, and I'm just gonna lean in and I can't wait to get to work.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['athletics-news', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.sp_.Jarmond.QA_.courtesy.jpg

She achieved most of them and managed to pick up a few more along the way.    Riley aimed to make decision-makers more accessible to students. Thanks in large part to Rileys office, student Academic Senate positions are now stipended, which could open up seats at the table to students who couldnt afford to donate time to academic policy debate without pay. Riley also worked to instate four student appointment positions on the public safety advisory committee following the Getty fire to ensure a student voice at the table in emergencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;    In a multi-year effort, Riley has also pushed the Academic Senate a little further out of its comfort zone on several key issues, including standardized testing and the availability of online materials.    On her student retention platform, Riley worked to implement a symbol system to indicate nontuition costs of all courses in the UCLA registrar. She also made strides in expanding USACs iClicker library, not to mention stretching book-lending times in cooperation with UCLA libraries.    Riley promised to designate Covel Commons as a study space for students. When students return to school next year, Covel Commons Residential Restaurant will be designated as a late night study space. On top of that success, Rileys office worked to establish Night Royce as a collaborative space for late-night studying and to revamp overnight laptop rentals.    Her office made an effort to redistribute enrollment units to better include students with dependents and veterans under the priority enrollment umbrella, a policy change that's currently making its way through the Academic Senate. She also pushed for a policy revision at the University of California level to allow LGBTQ+ students to consistently use their lived names.&nbsp;    At the council table, Riley has taken charge in writing letters and resolutions on vital campus issues, including the Getty fire and the COVID-19 outbreak. She pushed hard to get administrators to the council table and seized opportunities to bring in students to provide testimonials.    This board recognizes Riley made significant gains in bringing students into USAC and expanding AACs social media presence, but withheld one point because, for better or worse, Riley said she felt USAC should not engage with critical comments on Reddit.    On the whole, Riley has had an exceptionally productive year, to the point that not every win could fit in this evaluation. This board congratulates Riley on a job well done.

In all my years serving the University of California, I have never witnessed what we are currently experiencing. A global pandemic has necessitated unprecedented changes to how we operate UCLA, as we try to hold on to some semblance of community amid these massive shifts and the emotional turmoil they bring.   While the hills of Westwood never truly protected us from the biases of the outside world, the online environment is even less suited to do so.  In just the past few weeks, we have received reports of classes, community spaces and meetings being ""Zoombombed."" While racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, transphobia or any other form of discrimination is not new, in this time it compounds the harm caused by constantly living on high alert. This is unacceptable.  To the extent that we can identify the students engaged in these activities, we will take them through the procedures outlined in the Student Conduct Code. If you witness or experience and incident of bias, we ask that you report it  here .  As I look ahead at the rest of spring quarter, I am concerned that these feelings of frustration and distrust will grow as we approach the undergraduate student government elections. Social media threads are brimming with lively discussion that too often turns into vitriolic attacks against specific students. Again, this is not new. But in this new world, it compounds the fear and anxiety students are already experiencing.  While we must not shy away from truthful, intellectually honest, rigorous debate, we must always pursue a politics of persuasion &#8211; not one of coercion. While the happiness or sadness of winning or losing these races will eventually subside, the impact of our words and actions on others will not. And while the university was built to be a home to healthy, and often heated, discussion, it was also designed as a place where all of us can falter, learn and grow. We must give each other the permission to be fallible, to make mistakes and to learn from them.  And we cannot let our desire to do what we truly believe is best for our community turn us into bigots; that is too high a price to pay for a seat on the council table.  While university administrators cannot and should not influence the outcomes of the election, I would like to remind you that just because you can say or do something does not mean you should say or do it. Content posted on the internet may go viral in ways you did not anticipate and follow you for years to come. Before engaging on social media, I ask that you pause and consider the impact of your words.   If this time has taught us anything, it is that crisis can bring the best and worst out of each of us. I hope this upcoming election brings out the best in our student community.     Blandizzi is the dean for students at UCLA.

For UCLA students, almost every aspect of the experience is different.  Except for one important thing: cost.  The debate around the cost and value of an online education for students at the University of California and other universities has been a focal point during the COVID-19 pandemic.  So much so, that a UC Davis student  filed  a lawsuit against the University asking for a   refund of various campus fees.   This is just one of a number of cases across the country in which students are  suing  their universities for various refunds.  UC officials have  said  repeatedly that neither tuition nor campus fees will be refunded and have cited increased costs during the transition to online classes as a reason for taking this stance.  But for students at UCLA and across the UC, that answer falls short.  Bruins and other students across the UC deserve more transparency and communication when it comes to the UC's hardline   stance on tuition and fee refunds. Students are owed answers and have the right to know where their money is going instead of having to blindly put their faith in the UCs assertion that every penny is critical to its operations.  Because, at a time when students may be facing heightened job loss and mental health issues, the last thing on their minds should be how their universities are spending tuition dollars.  Sarah McBride, a spokesperson for the UC, said in an emailed statement that the UC is disappointed with the lawsuit demanding fee refunds. McBride said the UC hopes, once the involved parties better understand the steps the UC has taken to support its students, it can resolve these matters.  But how students can be expected to understand these steps remains unclear, especially when a clear picture of the UC's finances is so hard to find.  Janet Napolitano, president of the UC, said in a letter to the UC community that estimated financial  losses  total around $1.2 billion. In addition to this, Napolitano announced that she and all 10 UC chancellors will take a 10% pay cut amid plans to enact salary freezes and other cost-cutting arrangements.  The main takeaway would seem to be that the UC is doing its best to cope with a huge financial hole, but a UC employee union begs to differ.  Research gathered by AFSCME Local 3299  suggests  that while the UCs finances lack a certain transparency, it is very capable of dealing with its fiscal problems without employing various austerity measures that could harm students and workers alike.  Its no wonder students are confused about the UCs finances and how they relate to their own tuition and fees.  Without properly explaining where tuition money is going and what increased costs it must now cover, the UC is leaving students in the dark. It is only natural that this leads to fears about whether students are being used as cash cows by the UC while receiving an online education that many feel is not worth the cost at this current moment.  The quality of education has drastically decreased,"" said Elaine Pham, a second-year molecular, cell, and developmental biology student. ""Its a lot harder to pay attention, and its just so hard to concentrate. One of my classes was supposed to be a lab class that was supposed to be six hours of lab (a week) this quarter, and now its just filling out a worksheet and watching the TA do the experiment.  Asking students to pay the same amount of tuition, while also failing to explain why that same amount of tuition must be charged, is incredibly frustrating and certainly not what students signed up for when they sent off their thousand-dollar tuition check to UCLA.  &nbsp;  Students are right to be outraged about the costs they are paying, especially when the communication and transparency from the UC is appalling. The UC may be heading for financial uncertainty, but   students are facing their own problems and they deserve a university that reduces their stress rather than adds to it.  The least the UC could do is try to understand that and provide the utmost transparency when it comes to its decision-making.  Noe Garcia, a second-year public affairs student and the 2020-2021 Undergraduate Students Association Council Financial Supports commissioner, said his office has made efforts to evaluate the spending of UCLA and the UC.  We have requested to receive a transparency report showing how tuition has been used in spring 2019 versus spring 2020 to help us fact-check how much they are actually spending, Garcia said. On the one hand, the UC is suffering a lot of costs, but on the other hand, students are going to a university and still arent receiving the full resources that they are paying for.  No one is denying that these are troubling times for the UC and UCLA.  UCLA spokesperson   Ricardo Vazquez said in an emailed statement that UCLA has experienced large losses as a result of   the cancellation of athletic events and conferences. Increased costs from UCLA Healths efforts to fight COVID-19 have also added to the university's tab.  Tuition and fee refunds could put the UC in an even bigger financial predicament, leading to potential cuts that would hurt students in different ways.  But simply dismissing students' concerns about tuition without providing any evidence wont cut it.  The best way for UCLA administration to ensure that students are understanding of what they are doing is to provide us with as much information as they can, Garcia said. Giving us more information, more reports that they are seeing that the students arent seeing  that will help in making sure students are understanding of what they are going through.  The COVID-19 crisis   is far from over.   But, as the UC scrambles to find a plan for how to conduct teaching in the near future, questions over tuition and fee refunds will only increase.  No matter how hard the UC tries to evade these questions ,  students deserve answers.  But, right now, all they have are questions and empty pockets.",['cap-andrew-raychawdhuri'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/op.grad01-1024x960.png

Council meetings take place every Tuesday at 7 p.m. and are open to all students. Spring quarter meetings will take place virtually on Zoom; links for the meetings can be found on the internal vice president&#8217;s Facebook  page . Watch a livestream of the meetings on the  USAC Live! channel  on YouTube.  Public Comment:    Representatives from the Transfer Student Center, the Afrikan Student Union, MEChA de UCLA and the Academic Affairs Commission said they support the Cultivating Unity for Bruins Referendum because they believe UCLA lacks adequate cultural centers and safe spaces on campus for marginalized student populations. The CUB Referendum introduces a $15.00 quarterly fee for undergraduate students, beginning in fall 2020, to fund space, resources and programming needs of marginalized and underrepresented communities.    A California Public Interest Research Group representative said the organization is circulating a  petition  to the California state government calling for mail-in ballots for the 2020 general election to be sent to all California voters.      Vivyana Prado, the chair of MEChA de UCLA, said she believes USAC should continue urging the Community Programs Office to be transparent regarding how it uses student fees.    Special Presentations:    UCPD spokesperson Lt. Scott Scheffler said UCPD is increasing campus patrols near buildings still occupied by students, such as residence halls, following reports of trespassers. He added that the lost-and-found, as well as the UCPD lobby, are closed.    Agenda:     The council discussed the establishment of a COVID-19 relief fund, which will provide $500 to $1,000 scholarships  on an application basis for students financially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Applications will be read by a committee of 12 to 15 staff members from USAC offices. USAC offices will donate portions of their budgets to the fund.    The council voted to endorse the Good Clothes Good People Referendum, which introduces a $0.33 quarterly fee to undergraduate students, beginning in fall 2020, to fund the distribution of free school supplies and hygiene products at USAC's GCGP redistribution center.       The council voted to endorse the Cultivating Unity for Bruins Referendum.    External Vice President Johana Guerra Martinez said she does not agree with the decision to include opposition and support speakers for referenda at the USAC candidate debate April 30. USA Election Board chair Navi Sidhu said he believes including opposition and support speakers allows students to better understand the referenda and will not lead to formation of opposition campaigns.     Josh O&#8217;Connor, assistant director of leadership and involvement for UCLA Residential Life, said De Neve Residential Restaurant has reopened and Feast at Rieber will reopen next week.     Academic Affairs Commissioner Naomi Riley said her office met with the UCLA Academic Senate about sending departmentwide emails to professors strongly encouraging them to introduce Pass/No Pass grading in their courses.     The council appointed Nneoma Kanu, a fourth-year sociology student, to the Campus Programs Committee.    Reports:    President Robert Watson said his office is working to ensure free blue books and scantrons will remain available to students after he leaves office.     Internal Vice President Kimberly Bonifacio said her office allocated $1,000 to Books for Bruins and plans to allocate the rest of its budget to the USAC COVID-19 relief fund.     General Representative 2 Orion Smedley said his office is working to develop natural language processing software to analyze budget documentation and present a breakdown of student fee allocations and spending to students.     Academic Affairs Commissioner Naomi Riley said her office worked with the Academic Senate to ensure students who have not paid their tuition will be contacted by financial aid to set up payment plans and not be dropped from classes. She added that her office has been meeting with the Academic Senate to discuss the possibility of holding summer session C and fall quarter classes online.    Facilities Commissioner Lily Shaw said her office helped to establish a disabled student union.     Transfer Student Representative Isabel Oraha said her office is focused on encouraging transfer students to vote in the USAC elections and plans to run spotlight features on transfer student candidates.

Despite the overall drop in crime, instances of reported crimes in Westwood remained relatively consistent, according to crime statistics from LAPD and CrimeMapping.com analyzed by the Daily Bruin. UCPD Community Services Division Lt. Scott Scheffler said there has been a general decline in crime on campus.  With fewer people on campus and on city streets, reported crime appears to have generally decreased. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles County officials issued ""safer at home""  orders  for residents on March 19 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. UCLA also moved classes online, which prompted more than  80%  of students living on the Hill to vacate their dorms.  Compared to a trend of  hot prowl burglaries  last quarter, there have been no reported thefts in any residential halls in recent weeks, occupied or not, Scheffler said.  &#8220;Right now, there&#8217;s only two to three people living on my floor, so it&#8217;s probably unlikely that someone would come in,&#8221; said Bianka Shibuya, a third-year exchange student majoring in international development studies who is currently living on the Hill. &#8220;I always felt safe here.&#8221;   But with UCLA&#8217;s decision to consolidate rooms, Shibuya said she feels the need to start worrying more about burglaries and the virus.   Within organizations that provide domestic violence hotlines like Peace Over Violence, there was mounting speculation that vacant streets would lead crimes to relocate indoors, triggering an upsurge in domestic reports.   Immediately after the statewide shutdown, Peace Over Violence braced for a spike on the hotline, especially regarding domestic violence.   &#8220;We look at the past, and we get spikes on the hotline when there&#8217;s a disaster like earthquakes (or) when there&#8217;s a movie about domestic violence and people are triggered. Even the #MeToo movement,&#8221; said Patti Giggans, executive director of Peace Over Violence, a nonprofit addressing sexual, domestic and interpersonal violence.  Risk factors of intimate partner violence include economic stressors such as low income and unemployment, as well as social isolation, lack of social support and even overcrowding, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Given stay-at-home orders and escalating concerns over a global recession, many individuals may face these risk factors or already be at heightened risk for intimate partner violence.  However, a spike in reported cases has not appeared, Giggans said.  In fact, LAPD&#8217;s crime data revealed more than a 28% decrease in intimate partner assault reports since the stay-at-home order was issued in California compared to the two weeks prior.  Giggans said she suspects that the dip could be a result of an assumption that police departments and hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID-19-related issues. Those affected by domestic violence may also be pushed into survival mode against the virus, she added.  &#8220;They may be more worried about getting sick than they are about getting slapped or being oppressed,&#8221; Giggans said. &#8220;COVID-19 is dominating everything.&#8221;  Even so, she said there is still a consistent stream of people reaching out for help, who manage to find narrow windows of opportunity to dial the hotline.  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be worried when we stop getting calls. That&#8217;s going to point to me a concern around whether things are getting dicier at home. But you know, we had people call us from the bathroom, so people are reaching out,&#8221; Giggans said.   Though an increase in domestic abuse calls may come in the future, the effects of the pandemic remain largely unknown, leaving many scrambling to adapt along the way, Giggans said.

But, like Americans across the country, she recently lost her job.  UCLA Recreation facilities closed until further notice on March 16, three days after UCLA announced its transition to online classes for spring quarter to help limit the spread of novel coronavirus.  The closing of (John Wooden Center) essentially means that I'm out of a job for the time being and have no way to make money, said Tsonton, a second-year psychology student.  Tsonton said she had already gone home before the John Wooden Center closed, out of concern for her health and safety, but had planned to go back to Los Angeles and work at some point during spring quarter.  Without her job, Tsonton will be financially secure as long as she is living at home. She relies on her paycheck more for day-to-day needs only when she lives on campus. Others arent so lucky, she said.  Many of my co-workers are far more financially dependent on (John Wooden Center) and work upwards of 30-40 hours per week, she said.  Carly Pomeroy, a third-year biology student who works as lifeguard for UCLA Recreation, spends 10-15 hours at UCLA Recreations six pools each week.  She had intended to remain at UCLA to continue working at them after classes moved online, but her plans changed when they closed.  There's around 90 people employed by the pools themselves, so it has a large impact, Pomeroy said. I'm sure that a lot of people really rely on this for groceries and rent and stuff like that. It was initially pretty disappointing.  Although Pomeroy is a work-study program participant, she will be able to make her finances work without the job. Though it was not essential, the extra money did help, she said.  Work-Study is a federal program that helps students to pay for school-related fees through on- or off-campus part-time jobs.  Pomeroy said her manager has forwarded resources about unemployment hours to employees.  The John Wooden Center, meanwhile, sends out weekly updates to employees, and is brainstorming new opportunities for employees to make money despite facilities being closed, Tsonton said.  I feel really fortunate to represent UCLA Recreation, she said. This time has been scary for everyone, but they're doing everything they can to support us.  First-year marine biology student Reina Robles started working at Rendezvous only four weeks ago. Shes since moved out of her dorm and will take her classes from home.  I'm really hoping I can get a job when I go home, she said. I was thinking Oh, if I stay here, I will have my job.' But I'm not even sure about that because dining halls might downsize.  In addition to UCLA Recreation facilities, which include the John Wooden Center and Bruin Fitness Center, campus libraries, museums and a majority of nonessential research laboratories have closed.  Despite students leaving campus, Robles most recent shift at the end of week 10 was just as busy as it usually is.  UCLA Housing Services stated in an email sent to students March 11 that it would continue normal business operations despite the closing of Covel Commons Residential Restaurant, which was already scheduled to close for renovations. Despite this message, Robles said that nobody is fully sure of what might happen in the future.  My manager said she doesnt even have many details but she will let us know anything she gets, she said.  With the future of dining halls and more facilities on the Hill up in the air, many students are left not knowing whether to stay for their job or return home for their safety, Robles said.  One of the student supervisors said, As your manager, Id rather you be here for your shifts. As your fellow student, if you can, get out, Robles said.",['cap-samantha-fredberg'],"['a-closer-look', 'campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.news_.studentjobloss.file_.jpg

At UCLA, our community is remarkably united by similar feelings of loss, confusion and concern, but also by light, hope and perspective that the pandemic has brought to the forefront. In Columns From Quarantine, Daily Bruin staffers and community submissions highlight the personal stories that mark this unprecedented moment. If you have a quarantine story to tell, you can submit it  here&nbsp; or email&nbsp; columnsfromquarantine@gmail.com    [caption id=""attachment_378976"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Andrea Grigsby/Illustrations Director)[/caption]  The bus to Las Vegas was due to leave the following morning. I was chosen to represent the marching band at the Pac-12 Mens Basketball Tournament, an honor four years in the making, and I was ecstatic that I was recognized for my hard work in the band and on my trumpet.  Then the email came. It was drizzly and overcast outside, and I was in class. Rumors were circulating that the trip had already been canceled, and we were just awaiting an email from our director to confirm. But instead we got a different email, from the vice chancellor, who announced that in-person classes would be suspended through early spring.   ""It was the first of many cancellations: of thousands of opportunities, hopes and expectations that would be extinguished by COVID-19s long, invisible shadow.""     Unbeknownst to us, it was the first of many cancellations: of thousands of opportunities, hopes and expectations that would be extinguished by COVID-19s long, invisible shadow. The trip, of course, was canceled, but my feelings about it were dwarfed by a second email that announced spring quarter would be conducted remotely and we should return home if possible.  I dont think any of us, seniors especially, are unhappy with the administrations decision. But the announcement was double-edged: at once an important step toward mitigation and also a death knell for so many experiences that had defined UCLA for me.  Like so many other seniors, I barely had enough time to say goodbye to friends I had made over four years of college  for some, perhaps the last time our paths will cross.  I packed my bags, shoved all of my food into an Ikea bag, and drove home just before sunset. I left my trumpet behind, its case still adorned with UCLA Athletics tags and stickers, souvenirs of a simpler time.  The road home was dotted with electronic Caltrans signs, lit orange by brusque warnings. Wash your hands. Stay home. Avoid gatherings. The purple Santa Susana Mountains enfolded me as the road stretched on.  My lifelong wish was to see my parents smiles as they watched me, the first person in my family to attend college, walk across the stage. That wish dissolved in front of me like it was the last scene in a movie I wasnt meant to see, or like a ghostly version of my future, now unwritten.  When I arrived at home, I was relieved to see my family healthy and safe, but my homecoming was tinged with the wistful nostalgia of leaving a piece of my identity behind at UCLA  a place where its experiences shaped me as much as I shaped them.  Without a regimen or a schedule, all of the days started to melt together, a velveteen drift of late mornings and lazy afternoons.  I took a couple of hours over the break to replay ""The Last of Us,"" a post-apocalyptic video game set in the wake of a fictional pandemic that affected almost two-thirds of the world's population. During the game, there is a section in which you ride a horse through an empty university campus at golden hour, ivy vines and bristly undergrowth slowly reclaiming its halls.  In-game, I found myself combing through long-empty dorm rooms, paused forever in time, thumbing through the notes and pictures of the lives these fictional students left behind.  I thought back to my own room at UCLA, it too paused in time. Polaroids of a trip to Yosemite are strung up on one wall. On another, a poster of Frank Oceans ""Blonde.""  Pieces of me, frozen in my apartment like a museum.  Right now, student favorites like Kerckhoff Coffeehouse or Bombshelter, each once filled with music, laughter and conversation, lay dormant, as if they only exist when we do. Even Bruin Walk, the same student highway that always felt almost as hectic and trafficked as the 405, is empty, no one left to peddle flyers or ask questions.  Theyre part of UCLAs micro-folklore, maybe only known to a few people at a time: the man with the huskies; Andre Oliver, the question man; the no smoking sign on the Physics and Astronomy Building stairwell that always seems to have a few packs worth of cigarettes underneath it; the one spot on the Gayley Avenue sidewalk outside of Sigma Chi where four people can roll up a joint and block crowds of students trying to get home, threading them into single-file conga lines snaking up the street; the crosswalk buttons no one has ever pushed.  It was as if everyone was playing their part in a meticulously directed play, and the virus dispelled the theater and left behind the stage.  If I had known that I would have to say goodbye to UCLA and its experiences, I might have spent more time admiring the campus in all of its autumnal, brick-laid beauty. I might have taken out my earbuds when I walked to class, taken up a friend on that coffee offer or rekindled my passion for some of the organizations I had lost interest in.   ""It was as if everyone was playing their part in a meticulously directed play, and the virus dispelled the theater and left behind the stage.""     I thought back to my time at UCLA, back to the little moments that I left behind: laughing with friends after taking a midterm that most of the class probably failed; trying to sneak in to the ""Stranger Things 2"" cast afterparty on campus during Halloween time; feeling the quiet electricity of campus during rivalry week; or even seeing someone get back up on a slackline on the hills by Janss Steps for the fifth time in an hour, one man strumming a guitar at the base of one of the trees, the other barefooting it across.  For me, small moments like these feel lost to time, not as if they were taken from me by force, but as if they slipped through my fingers, like grains of sand.  Explosive change often makes more sense in the rearview, especially when the feelings it leaves in its wake are difficult to process. Maybe its because change is so often accretive, and you dont realize youve entered a new life until you look back at the one you left behind.  College is achingly personal, and while much of college is defined by its most explosive, shared moments, I also think college is defined by its quietest moments. When it really is just you, alone in your room after a bad day, wishing you could just call your mom or give one of your friends a hug.  Its moments like these that have been prismatically magnified in my mind by COVID-19, at one time inconsequential, now as big as landscapes.  If you asked me to remember what I was doing exactly two months ago from today, or what I was doing Aug. 23, 2015, I wouldn't be able to. But what I do remember are all the little rituals that I did every morning before class, the quiet courage that crackled within so many of my friends, the electric chaos of De Neve Late Night on a Thursday night, and the twinkling, firefly-like magic that fills UCLAs many halls.   ""Maybe, in COVID-19s vacuum, there is no such thing as a quiet memory; they roar.""     I think COVID-19 has reminded us that we are all amnesiacs, one way or another. Its too easy to forget the quiet memories in favor of the loud. Maybe, in COVID-19s vacuum, there is no such thing as a quiet memory; they roar.  Every meal with a friend, a banquet. Every walk to class, a marathon. Every smile, a slice of heaven.  Perhaps, despite all the demons it has released on the world, COVID-19 will help us remember.

The New York Giants picked Holmes with the 110th overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft on Saturday, while the Los Angeles Chargers selected running back Joshua Kelley 112th overall just minutes later. The duo joined tight end Devin Asiasi to give UCLA football three selections in the first 112 picks, a feat the program has achieved just twice since 2002.    Holmes was the 12th cornerback to hear his name called on the weekend. Holmes entered the weekend as the No. 16 prospect at his position, according to CBS Sports, and had been projected to go as early as 80th overall and as late as 173 overall by prominent mock drafts.    Holmes is just the fourth UCLA cornerback drafted since 1996 and the first since Fabian Moreau went 81st overall in 2017.    The former five-star recruit led UCLA with two interceptions in 2019, and he recorded eight picks and 20 pass breakups in his 35 career games as a Bruin.    Holmes will be joining second-round pick Xavier McKinney of Alabama and premiere free agent cornerback addition James Bradberry as new faces in the Giants secondary. UCLA coach Chip Kelly told the media NFL teams were planning to use Holmes as a slot or nickel corner at the next level during a teleconference April 8.    Back on the Pacific coast, one of Holmes former teammates will get the chance to line up alongside former Pac-12 quarterback and sixth overall pick Justin Herbert in the Chargers backfield.    Kelley was rated as the No. 10 running back prospect entering the draft by CBS Sports, and he wound up being the 10th to get picked.    2016 Pro Bowler Jordan Howard was the 10th running back picked in the 2016 draft, while 2018 Pro Bowler Tarik Cohen was the 10th tailback off the board in 2017.    Kelley is the highest UCLA running back selected since Maurice Jones-Drew went 60th overall in 2006.    Kelley racked up 2,303 rushing yards and 25 total touchdowns in his 22 career games with UCLA. The former transfer and UC Davis walk-on posted back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons in 2018 and 2019, becoming the first Bruin to do so since Paul Perkins in 2014 and 2015.    Former UCLA linebackers Krys Barnes, Lokeni Toailoa, Josh Woods and Keisean Lucier-South highlight the rest of the Bruins left on the board, while center Boss Tagaloa and kicker JJ Molson are still available as well.

Sentosos father, Harry Sentoso, passed away at 63, two weeks after he started working at Amazon in late March  during the company's hiring spree following high demand for essential and non-essential items. At the time, Amazon did not heavily enforce masks and social distancing, Sentoso said.  Sentoso, a rising fourth-year cognitive science student, reached out to Kent Wong, the director of the UCLA Labor Center, after his father passed away for guidance on how to prevent workers from facing a similar situation. Sentoso took a labor studies course with Wong in the fall.  Wong said he was moved when he first heard Sentosos request.  It really touched me, Wong said. Even in this very tragic family situation, he was looking beyond and seeing that there was something wrong here and that he needs to do something to make sure that other people will not suffer a similar fate.  Wong also gave Sentoso a labor studies perspective on his fathers experience with Amazon.  The fact that we have one of our own students suffer as a consequence of the callous disregard for worker safety at the hands of this massive corporation ... is something that needs awareness, Wong said.  Wong said Harry Sentoso did everything right in the traditional sense: he immigrated from Indonesia to the United States, got a masters degree and raised two sons. Yet, he passed away from COVID-19 a few weeks after getting the job at Amazon to support his family, Wong said.  [caption id=""attachment_386018"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1600""]  Sentoso hopes to continue sharing his father's story to advocate for labor rights. (Courtesy of Evan Sentoso)[/caption]  Wong said he offered Sentoso an internship at the UCLA Labor Center to further his labor rights activism. The Labor Center offers internships to students who are passionate about worker justice issues, and Wong saw Sentoso as an ideal candidate, Wong said.  Wanting to protect other workers from his fathers experience, Sentoso said he shared his fathers experience with the Los Angeles Times and KTLA hoping to raise awareness about the lack of protection some workers face.  Sharing my story and listening to other people battle with COVID-19 is a way to be in this fight together, Sentoso said.  Sentoso plans to continue to share his fathers story, learn how to raise awareness for labor rights and research how to unionize workers to institute change for labor rights through his internship.  Offering my voice and sharing my dad's story I think can potentially be powerful,"" Sentoso said. Especially in a time of emergency, where people's lives are at stake.  But Sentoso is still grieving.  Immediately after his father passed, Sentoso said he and his brother cared for their mother Endang Sentoso, who contracted COVID-19 soon after her husband. The two monitored her condition and practiced strict hygiene, such as disinfecting various surfaces in their house and washing their hands to aid her recovery. They also practiced social distancing and wore masks, creating an impossible nature to grieve, Sentoso said.  Grieving immediately after my dads passing was almost non-existent, he said.  Sentoso said he and his brother tried to take the loss of his father day by day, but felt trapped in a world of perpetual darkness and isolation.  Sentoso takes walks around his neighborhood, but seeing places he and his father used to frequent  like the neighborhood park or his high school  sometimes causes him to break down, he said.  Once, when Sentoso and his mother waited in line at 99 Ranch Market, an Asian grocery store, they bursted into tears. The market housed memories of the family going on grocery trips growing up, Sentoso said.  You don't expect to have these breakdowns, you just kind of do, he said. It's not something you can control.  His mother has since recovered and Sentoso has found ways to cope with his fathers passing.  Since most of his extended family is in Indonesia and because of the need for social distancing, Sentoso did not have much in-person support from his family and friends, but it would have helped tremendously, he said.  Talking about his fathers life over video calls isnt the same, Sentoso said.  Some of Sentosos family and friends found ways around social distancing regulations to support him.  A few of Sentosos high school and college friends surprised him with care packages and food. He once received face masks from a friend in Maryland. Sentosos cousin, who lives 20 minutes away from him, regularly visited Sentosos house to make sure Sentoso and his family were well-fed.  Joshua Lee, a rising fourth-year economics student and one of Sentosos closest friends, said he and his parents frequently dropped off meals at Sentosos house to help support.  Lee would also talk to Sentoso when dropping food off. He remembers talking with Sentoso once for an hour. Talking to his friend in person about non-COVID related topics, like the next school year or apartment life, was nice, Lee said.  Sentoso is grateful for his friends and family who reached out to him.  I couldn't have asked for such a supportive  and caring group of friends, Sentoso said.  Sentoso said he hopes that by sharing his fathers story, he can raise awareness on how corporate America should better protect its workers' wellbeing.  Sentoso said he is sure that his father would have wanted him to move forward.  My dad definitely would have wanted me, my brother and my entire family to ... keep fighting even in the most difficult of times, Sentoso said. I am determined to continue and follow my dad's footsteps and hopefully make the world a better place.",['cap-anushka-chakrabarti'],"['a-closer-look', 'california', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.news_.evansfather.courtesy.jpg

UCLAs first ballet company, founded by Ada Chung, Ying Xuan Chua and Moe Kawakami, has been holding virtual Zoom events throughout spring quarter. By catering to dancers of all skill levels and experiences, Kawakami, a first-year human biology and society student, said the co-founders hope to foster an inclusive and supportive atmosphere at the Ballet Company at UCLA.  My experience with ballet isnt in a very competitive or professional setting and thats sort of the community I want to bring into establishing our ballet company, Kawakami said. I want it to be open (without) that competitive nature ballet usually has.  Upon arriving at college, Chung, a first-year psychobiology student, said she was surprised to find out that UCLA did not have a ballet company. Since starting ballet at five years old, Chung had attended intensives at Moscows Bolshoi Ballet Academy as well as Joffrey Ballet and said she found herself missing the art. This eventually led her to attend open classes at a studio in Santa Monica with Kawakami.   [Related:    Dance students adjust to curriculum changes, self-accountability of online learning   ]   In the many round trips to the studio, Chung said the two began entertaining the thought of starting their own ballet company at UCLA so they could dance closer to campus. The pair began the process of turning their idea into reality during winter quarter and invited Chua, a first-year economics and psychology student, to help.  (Initially) we thought maybe there werent a lot of people interested in ballet and thats why there wasnt a ballet company already, Chung said. But after we sent out an interest survey, there (were many) responses from people saying how theyve been looking for a ballet company for so long.  The trio first established their ballet companys goals with the primary purpose of offering opportunities for dancers of all skill levels, Kawakami said. To support the varied experience each dancer has, Chung said the co-founders hold all workshops over Zoom at an intermediate level. Beginners have the opportunity to slow down exercises to learn at their own pace, while advanced dancers can perform the same exercises on relev, which is on the toes rather than on flat feet, Chung said.  We still want to have that portion where more advanced dancers can challenge themselves, Chung said. (But) we also want that portion where beginners can try out dance or get back into dance.  The ballet companys workshops begin with slower warmups, Chung said, like plis that involve the bending of the knees and dgags that require dancers to point their feet in various directions. Gradually, she said the instructors progress to quicker movements like battements, which are faster pointings of the entire leg, and rond de jambes, where the dancer's leg moves in a semicircle.  Considering the current workshops are not held in a studio, Chua said the main focus is connecting dancers with their bodies by focusing on completing the exercises to the best of their abilities rather than nitpicking technique. Dancers are also encouraged to adjust exercises based on the amount of space they have at home, Chua said.  A lot of people think ballet needs specialized equipment, which is true to some extent, Chua said. But the fundamentals of ballet (are) just about movement and getting to know your body.  With time, Chung said the ballet company hopes to offer beginner and advanced level workshops as opposed to solely instructing intermediate level ones. To get new dancers in tune with their bodies and with the basics of ballet, Chua said beginner workshops would be geared towards learning the French terminology that comes with the art and engaging in strength training to improve bodily control.  For more advanced dancers, Chua said the ballet company intends to challenge them by offering complex and fast-paced exercises like grande allgro, or large jumps, and fouetts, which are one-legged turns. Experienced dancers will also be able to choreograph and teach their own combinations, Chung said.  When youre (learning) all the different techniques, it can be difficult to put them together and pace them with music, Chung said. An advanced dancer will (be challenged by getting) more creative in choreographing.   [Related:    Dance Marathon 2020 moves online with a focus on themes of unity and awareness   ]   Though the virtual workshops are fulfilling, the rest of the co-founders vision is dependent on returning to UCLA in the fall, Kawakami said. The ballet company plans to hold a recital at the end of every spring quarter where Chua said all dancers can perform for an audience and showcase what they have learned throughout the year.  We want to give beginning, intermediate and advanced dancers opportunities to perform for other people because its very different from when you just dance in the studio, Chua said. Its a different kind of vulnerability and level of expression.  In the few months that the ballet company has been active, Chua said the number of people who have attended their workshops  even though they are online  has been heartwarming. UCLA Ballet Company has been able to build their own community, Chung said, and more importantly, find a way to do ballet no matter the circumstances.  (Our ballet company helped) us find a home within UCLA, Chung said. Its like a safe haven for us to go dance together and thats the best part.",['cap-vivian-xu'],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.UCLAballetco.ADX_.jpg

The videos depicting instances of police brutality   from this past week are disturbing, horrifying and ugly  .  But for many Americans, these televised moments are a daily   reality.  In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year old black woman, was in her apartment when she was shot and killed by Louisville police. Last week,  three men  in Georgia were arrested for pursuing and killing Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man.   Arbery was jogging in his neighborhood and was unarmed. Less than a week later, bystanders videotaped a     Minneapolis police officer  kneeling  on the neck of and eventually killing George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man.     This video immediately   gained traction on social media, sparking public outrage for its disturbing content, including Floyd&#8217;s last words: &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe.&#8221;  Those were also the last words of  Eric Garner , a 43-year-old black man who died at the hands of the NYPD in 2014. &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe&#8221; became a  rallying cry  for protests against police brutality   and has now returned at demonstrations   across America ,  where protestors are demanding justice for Floyd and an end to police brutality.  Police brutality is an extension of systemic racism against black Americans dating back to times of slavery. From &#8220;Black Codes&#8221; created to limit black rights in the post-Civil War era to police attacks on black protesters during the civil rights movement, the institutionalized violence against black bodies is sadly nothing new.   &#8220;People have consistently said, &#8216;You can't blame a few bad apples,&#8217; but it's not just the apples,&#8221; said Alexandria Davis, fourth-year African American studies and political science student and president of Afrikan Student Union. &#8220;It's a whole rotten tree when an organization is rooted in racism and slavery. You cannot come back from that. ""   Black Americans have been demanding equality for centuries, and the events of last week demonstrate that the nation is nowhere near to   achieving it.  We, the authors of this column, are not black individuals ourselves. But remaining silent or neutral signifies compliance with these injustices.   In order to change systems of oppression, we all have the responsibility to empathize and become allies &#8211; because this issue demands everyone's full attention. This is never more true for institutions of education such as UCLA, which must serve as an ally to black students while also promoting solidarity.     This means calling local politicians and demanding change and accountability,   signing petitions, donating to organizations and fundraisers and sharing these resources on social media. And UCLA as a whole needs to ensure they are providing the necessary   resources to black students on campus.    Allyship starts with spreading awareness. But in order to do so effectively, we must not speak for black students &#8211; instead, we need to listen.  Despite a whirlwind of helpful information and overall support on social media, some well-intentioned users have been accused of sharing &#8220;trauma porn,&#8221; &#8211;   violent images and videos depicting police brutality for   its   shock value, according to Davis. This such content   may be traumatic or triggering for black viewers.  Performative activism, or sharing graphics and messages done solely to partake in a trend, often lacks any real substance. This does not directly support the victims of injustice, nor does it enact actual change.  &#8220;I think that sharing posts is a good introductory step,&#8221; said Trisden Shaw, president of the Black Graduate Student Association at UCLA and an African American studies graduate student. &#8220;But this type of performative allyship with hashtags and hashtag chains is not really doing much for people.&#8221;  Words without associated action do not reflect true activism.  &#8220;Allyship often feels so performative,"" Shaw said.  "" To me, an ally is someone who is willing to fight the fight. An ally is someone with privilege that knows how to use their privilege.&#8221;  Privilege for nonblack individuals means that the color of their skin is a selective advantage, like the choice to remain silent while black people cannot. And UCLA students with this privilege should not stay silent.  Otilia Danalache, a first-year political science student, said encouraging active contribution appropriately exhibits allyship.     &#8220;I saw a lot of people posting screenshots of their donations asking their friends to match them,&#8221; Danalache said. &#8220;So I posted my donation to the Minnesota Freedom Fund and, within a day, (my followers collectively donated) over $200.&#8221;  Due to overwhelming support, the  Minnesota Freedom Fund    has since asked that donations be redirected to other organizations, including the  Black Visions Collective ,  Reclaim the Block  and the  North Star Health Collective .   Individual students should not be the only ones in the UCLA community demanding change. Student organizations     have just as much of a responsibility to spread awareness and encourage activism.  Breeze Velazquez, the 2020-2021 Undergraduate Students Association Council Academic Affairs commissioner and second-year Chicano/Chicana studies and public affairs student, said she wants to see the AAC take an active stance against police brutality.  She also noted that it is important to take a step back and listen to the perspective of black individuals to learn how to be a good ally.  &#8220;The best thing that a white ally, a Latina ally, an Asian ally can do is learn this information and go into their communities, and speak out,&#8221; said vice-chair of ASU and fourth-year African American studies student Saturne Tchabong. &#8220;Call out anti-blackness and talk about racial injustice.&#8221;  ASU also stresses the importance of black mental health during this difficult period and encourages students to check   in   on their black friends, which can serve as another form of allyship.   &#8220;Checking in with your black friends is something that is very overlooked,&#8221; Tchabong said. &#8220;I had a close friend, (who is) Latina, who did reach out to me and that meant more to me than any post that I spotted.&#8221;  As a result of concerns about the mental well-being of black students, ASU created a  petition  asking the UCLA administration and Academic Senate to reduce the rigor of finals to accommodate students who may have difficulty focusing given the current global climate. The petition calls for signatures from both affected students and community members who empathize with those who need these adjustments.  In a campus-wide email sent out addressing recent events, UCLA vocalized its support for Black Lives Matter.  &#8220;We conclude by stating unequivocally that Black lives DO matter,"" the statement read. ""They matter at UCLA. They matter in Minnesota. They matter everywhere.""  But Tchabong said these efforts by the UCLA administration are long overdue.  &#8220;(This is) something that we've been telling them for five-plus years now: Black students need resources,"" Tchabong said. ""We need a resource center that is fully funded. If (Chancellor   Gene Block) truly believes that black lives matter, he would get us those resources.&#8221;  And if UCLA is serious about   its statement, it must serve as a proper ally to Black Lives Matter. This begins with listening to black students.  Of course, in the meantime, UCLA students should be given some credit for their efforts on social media, whether it be a hashtag chain or a link to a petition. Any form of acknowledgment is better than nothing.   But activism should not end once you leave the virtual sphere.  To those who want to be   allies: Use your privilege as a platform to educate yourself and others, post appropriately and remember that it is not enough to be &#8220;not racist&#8221;&#8212; we must be proactively anti-racist. Listen to black voices and amplify them.   Channel your discomfort, frustration and anger to empathize with victims of systemic racism and partake in a movement beyond yourself.  And remember how you feel today when it comes time to vote in November.

Clark &#8211; who transferred from Corona Centennial to Etiwanda High School for his senior year &#8211; averaged 18.5 points and 6.4 rebounds per game for the Eagles this past season, leading the team to a 30-4 record before its eventual elimination at the hands of Sierra Canyon in the CIF Open Division regional finals.  Clark's role for the upcoming season remains in question given the uncertainty of junior guard Chris Smith's pending NBA Draft decision. Regardless, it will be difficult for Clark to crack an already-crowded rotation.  Measuring in at 6-foot-5 and 200 pounds, Clark has the size to play both shooting guard and small forward for the Bruins, but he will have to beat out rising junior guards Jules Bernard and David Singleton &#8211; as well as rising sophomore guard Jake Kyman and rising sophomore guard/forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. &#8211; if he wants to earn extended minutes.   Because of the loss of Nix, Singleton will likely slide into the backup point guard role as he did on multiple occasions this past season, which could give Clark a better window of opportunity to see the floor.   Defensive stopper   If there is one thing that separates Clark from the players in front of him on the depth chart, it's his defensive potential.  Clark has a wide build and plays with a sense of urgency and toughness on the defensive end, something the Bruins have been lacking in recent years and the type of player that coach Mick Cronin has been known to covet.  ""I think he&#8217;s a perfect fit for me,"" Cronin said in an interview in April. ""He&#8217;s a tough guy, he&#8217;s a hard worker, he&#8217;s a winner. He can play all over the floor.&#8221;  Perimeter defense is not the strength of anybody in the Bruins' most recent backcourt rotation, and UCLA struggled with stopping the dribble penetration for much of the 2019 season because of it.         Given Clark's elite lateral quickness and physical play style, he should have no issues guarding the 1-3 positions and filling that defensive void if need be. It wouldn't be surprising if Cronin eventually uses him as a designated defender at some point in his career, either.   Offense in progress     Clark is far from an elite scorer, but he has the tools to grow into a formidable offensive weapon for the Bruins down the road.   Clark's size gives him the ability to attack the basket downhill, despite not being the most prolific ball-handler. He is also a strong finisher around the rim with plenty of strength to absorb contact and finish plays.        Like much of UCLA's current roster, Clark is at his best offensively while running in transition rather than being in the half-court set. Clark's verticality and explosiveness make him a lethal weapon in the open court and a highlight reel waiting to happen the second he arrives in Westwood. Outside of the paint, Clark isn't known to be much of a shooter. He shot just 26% on 364 3-point attempts during his first three years of high school.         However,  the form on his jumper appears to be fundamentally sound. With proper coaching and development, there's no reason Clark shouldn't be able to add the 3-pointer to his arsenal eventually.  While it's unlikely that Clark ever becomes a true isolation scoring option for the Bruins, he certainly could become a consistent double-digit scoring slasher by the end of his collegiate career.           Battle tested     The transition from high school to college basketball isn't always easy for players because the game speeds up and the stage becomes greater.   However, Clark has plenty of big game experience and has proven to be unafraid of the moment. He finished high school with a 13-9 postseason record and has regularly gone toe-to-toe with some of the nation's top prospects &#8211; including the No. 7 recruit on the 2020 ESPN 100 and Stanford commit Ziaire Williams.  As a junior in December 2018, Clark scored 33 points to Williams' 31 en route to a nine-point victory. Clark also erupted for 32 points in a postseason loss to Williams &#8211; who finished with 23 points &#8211; and Sierra Canyon earlier this year on Feb. 21.   Player comparison: Matt Barnes   Clark won't be lighting up defenses with a polished offensive game, but he will be giving every ounce of energy he has on the defensive end.  Despite being a few inches shorter than Matt Barnes, Clark brings a similar skill set to the table. His long arms and exceptional lateral quickness make him a nuisance on the defensive side of the ball, giving him opportunities to create turnovers that will get UCLA out and running.         The Bruins finished eighth in the Pac-12 in turnovers forced per game this past season, so the addition of Clark should move them up the ladder in 2020-2021.  Like Barnes, Clark will be doing most of his scoring through dribble penetration and with effort plays. Barnes never shot better than 29.4% from beyond the arc until his senior season, but managed to increase his scoring output every year of his collegiate career.   While Clark may never shoot that low of a percentage from long range in college, the majority of his points will still be coming from inside the arc. Expect him to be aggressive, using his size and strength to his advantage.

This year was no different for Shannon Perry-LeBeauf, UCLA womens basketball associate head coach.  Despite her birthday falling amid the spread of the novel coronavirus, Perry-LeBeauf was still able to celebrate her birthday with her family  her UCLA family. A Zoom video call that featured the players and coaches commemorated the birthday on April 3.  Family is everything  when you are faced with hard things and uncertainty, you need your family, Perry-LeBeauf said. Knowing that we have each other, it means the world to all of us.  About a year prior, Perry-LeBeauf found herself with the same people in an entirely different unforeseen situation. When she walked into Pauley Pavilion on Feb. 11, 2019, for what she had been told was a photoshoot, Perry-LeBeauf was expecting to be met with cameras and a few donors.  But when she walked in and heard the song ""Chills"" by Charlie Wilson playing through the arena's speakers and saw all the faces of her players and coworkers ,  she knew something was up.  It was a setup among all setups ever, Perry-LeBeauf said. They staged this donor function that we had to take pictures for that day  it was all fake, and I had no idea.""  Before long, Perry-LeBeaufs then-boyfriend Sean LeBeauf, surrounded by friends, family, and Joe and Josie Bruin, got down on one knee at center court and asked for Shannon Perry-LeBeauf's hand in marriage.  [caption id=""attachment_378096"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    The UCLA women's basketball players flocked to Perry-LeBeauf after their coach slipped on her engagement ring. (Courtesy of Shannon Perry-LeBeauf)[/caption]  When Shannon Perry-LeBeauf said the word ""yes,"" the players  who were just as surprised as she was  were the first ones to greet her with excited shrieks, hugs and even tears.  ""The players had no idea,"" Shannon Perry-LeBeauf said. ""It was just an unforgettable moment and memory for me to be able to share something so personal with these young women. I love them, and my life is an open book and I want to be a great role model  for them to be able to witness that it was really special to me.""  And while staging a proposal at his fiancee's workplace might not seem like the most romantic gesture, Sean LeBeauf said having her UCLA family there to watch was integral to the plan.  The most important thing for (Shannon Perry-LeBeauf) was not that it was done at Pauley Pavilion, Sean LeBeauf said. The biggest thing for her was that the most important people in her life were present to witness it  the UCLA family.  Four months later, on the day of the wedding, Shannon Perry-LeBeauf was surrounded by her UCLA family once again. Nearly the entire team showed up to Thousand Oaks, California, the weekend before spring quarter finals week to support one of their closest coaches and mentors.  Perry-LeBeauf said the team being there for her on her big day epitomized the familylike nature of the program.  One reason I chose not to have a destination wedding was because I wanted (the players) to be able to share it and to be able to come, Perry-LeBeauf said. It just spoke volumes to the family atmosphere that we do have here.  Perry-LeBeauf said some of her players went above and beyond  including junior forward Lauryn Miller, who Perry-LeBeauf described as her right-hand person leading up to the wedding. Miller helped with the invitations and dress fittings, as well as leading the reception setup for the out-of-town guests.  Millers relationship with Perry-LeBeauf, however, started long before the wedding.  (Miller) is like my child, Perry-LeBeauf said. We began to get closer the second half of her freshman year. Fast forward to her sophomore year, (Miller) would hang around a whole lot and I took her under my wing a little bit and she asked me to mentor her.  While Miller's growth as a player has shown on the court  as she improved her stat line from averaging 13.3 to 22.0 minutes, 2.7 to 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 to 6.7 points per game between her sophomore and junior seasons  coach Cori Close said the most important parts of Perry-LeBeauf's mentorship have been private.  The head coach said Perry-LeBeauf has been an off-the-court role model for many players.  (Perry-LeBeauf) has been a tremendous influence of (Miller's) development between the lines, but she's been more of an influence from the character side  from the growth as a young woman, Close said. There's just several of our players that would also say that. You can't find an area of our program that she hasn't had her hands in.  Perry-LeBeauf's Instagram and Twitter handles  ""imamentor_ucla""  say it best. She is a self-described mentor for all the players on the team.  Sean LeBeouf  who is an assistant women's basketball coach at Prairie View A&amp;M  said his wife's job title of ""basketball coach"" is just that: a title. He said mentoring her players is what comes first for her.  ""Helping them develop into young women is the most important thing for her,"" Sean LeBeauf said. ""Coaching is just the avenue for her to do it.""  After coaching for 10 straight years with stops at Iowa, USC and Duke, Shannon Perry-LeBeauf took a two-year break from coaching at the collegiate level. It wasn't until she called Close to congratulate her on getting the UCLA head coaching job that it became a possibility for her to come back into coaching.  The transition to UCLA wasnt always easy for Perry-LeBeauf, especially when she was first hired.  As a self-described introvert, she said the transition of joining such a tight-knit team was difficult for her because it forced her to open up in front of her players and fellow coaches.  (Close) said it best  We do life together, Perry-LeBeauf said. That was hard for me to adjust to when I first got here. I'm really introverted, I'm a private person  what do you mean Do life?'  [caption id=""attachment_378097"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""729""]    As the associate head coach for UCLA women's basketball, Perry-LeBeauf works with the rest of the staff to draw up the game plan. But off the court, she considers herself a mentor to each player who sets foot in the Bruin locker room. (Alex Driscoll/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  The teams results during her first year didnt help her transition either, as the Bruins went just 14-16 and missed out on any postseason play during the 2011-2012 season beyond the Pac-12 tournament.  Perry-LeBeauf said it was during this hardship that the team truly developed the family dynamic it has today.  It's so much a family because families are not perfect  you go through the ups and downs and the highs and lows and you love regardless, Perry-LeBeauf said. It's unconditional and that's what this is all about. That makes us tougher and it makes us stronger together.  The associate head coach said it is this family dynamic that makes her job as a recruiter that much easier. Perry-LeBeauf helped land the first No. 1-ranked class in UCLA history in 2014.  ""It's easy to sell because it's real,"" Perry-LeBeauf said. ""It's one thing if you're trying to sell something that you're not being honest about. But what we have is real, and (recruits) can see it and can feel (the family atmosphere). They sense it when they come and visit.""  Nearly nine years after her initial transition to UCLA, Perry-LeBeauf and her Bruins are faced with a unique challenge  one off the court that impacted their ability to compete: the cancellation of the March Madness because of the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Close said it was upsetting to lose a final chance to show off the team's on-court chemistry, but that the unforeseen circumstances have forced the players to focus even more on their personal dynamic  so often led by Perry-LeBeauf.  It's really painful that you never got a chance to see how that chemistry would have played out in the NCAA tournament, Close said. ""The chemistry here is undeniable, and (Perry-LeBeauf) is in charge of really just orchestrating how we are intentional about that.  When the news that their season had come to an end broke March 12, players migrated toward their coaches' offices so they could be together one last time.  That kind of showed how much they were hurting  they needed to be around their basketball family because it wasn't supposed to end, Perry-LeBeauf said. They weren't ready for it to be over. There was a desire or a want to still be around their family.  Whether it's at her wedding or on a virtual birthday call, whenever Perry-LeBeauf is around her players, she's with family.",['cap-jon-christon'],"['features', 'sports', 'womens-basketball']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/hz.web_.sp_.Perry_.feat_.AD_.pica_.jpg

Across the UC, COVID-19 responses have been swift. Campuses throughout the state have taken steps to  move instruction online  for the remainder of the academic year. Absent from this swift and necessary response, though, has been a clear lines of two-way communication between administration and student leaders.  In the midst of this pandemic, during which drastic steps must be taken by the University of California to protect public health, students cannot be left out of the decision-making process. And most importantly, students cannot be left footing the bill for the long-term impacts of these decisions about their food, housing, health and financial security.  At UCLA, student leaders on the Undergraduate Students Association Council expressed frustration over a lack of meaningful consultation in the March 10 decision and rollout of UCLA&#8217;s suspension of in-person classes until April 10. An absence of continued updates and consultation led to a flurry of rumors and misinformation in the leadup to the decision to suspend in-person classes for the remainder of spring quarter.  UC-wide, campus-driven decisions have led to a lack of coordinated responses across all nine campuses. This has left statewide student leaders at the UC Student Association out of the loop on crucial decisions affecting students.  Elsewhere, unforeseen consequences for students' basic needs are coming as a result of inadequate student representation in COVID-19 decision-making.  At Harvard University, students were told they had  five days  to either vacate university housing or face eviction. Absent from this directive was any concern for whether students had the financial resources to go home, or even if they had homes to go back to. As a result, students have had to  improvise and crowdfund  for essential basic-needs resources.  Harvard&#8217;s actions, which have also happened at  Ohio State  and  Pomona College , present a case study in what not to do. This kind of haphazard response cannot happen at the UC. The University has the opportunity to cultivate national leadership in response.  Because in the short-term rush to action, long-term impacts to student basic needs can&#8217;t be left out. Student input in these vital decisions can mitigate those impacts.  To the UC&#8217;s credit, it has had perhaps one of the most thoughtful responses to COVID-19. At UCLA and its sister schools, campus leaders have committed to keeping on-campus housing and dining operations  open for students , while offering students who opt to leave campus prorated refunds. UC schools are also working proactively with their international students to  address visa challenges  during this uncertain time.  But more can be done.  For students living in off-campus apartments wishing to move home, UCLA&#8217;s Student Legal Services should provide help to students wishing to renegotiate their leases. And should an  emergency ban on evictions  be passed by the Los Angeles City Council shortly, UCLA should offer pro bono legal services to students should landlords violate this ban.  Student workers and teaching assistants should be granted increased flexibility as they weigh remaining on campus. For student jobs that cannot be done remotely, student workers should be guaranteed paid administrative leave. And for students that rely on off-campus jobs to make ends meet, UCLA should provide streamlined access to emergency loans or cost-of-attendance adjustments for them in the event of downsizing.  Especially in a global pandemic, continued access to health care is essential. Students with UC Student Health Insurance Plan should be made aware of telehealth options, the presence of UC Health in their own communities or reciprocal out-of-state network health benefits. Students relying on mental health counseling from Counseling and Psychological Services should be guaranteed online continuity of care. And given the breakthrough of UC developing its own  in-house COVID-19 test , students should receive access to free testing should their doctors recommend testing.  As students navigate the difficult transition toward an online learning environment, UCLA must also provide or connect students with subsidies for computer hardware, software and internet for students without home access. Greater flexibility for payment extensions will also ease the burden on students and families during this crisis.  Certain UC campuses have committed to only a couple of these common-sense solutions. But none, including UCLA, have committed to all. And the lack of consistent commitments systemwide means UC students face uneven and unequal benefits during this crisis.  Amid all this is the looming specter of a multi-year tuition increase at Thursday&#8217;s Board of Regents meeting, which is continuing largely in-person despite an  executive order  from Gov. Gavin Newsom on social distancing.  Regents will be voting on a cohort-based plan of yearly tuition increases that would see fall&#8217;s incoming class pay an additional  $606  if they are in-state students.  At a moment of unprecedented uncertainty for students and their families as a result of COVID-19, the university cannot charge another massive bill on the backs of students.  The novel coronavirus will reshape all of our lives for several months. In order to address its vast impacts on campus life, the administration and students must work together in partnership to mitigate unforeseen impacts.  With time, the UC community will get through this. But it's naive to think this crisis won&#8217;t hit the most vulnerable student populations the hardest.  And the only way to move beyond this crisis in a truly equitable fashion is if all campus leaders &#8211; administrative, faculty, staff and student &#8211; work closely together with a focus on those most marginalized.

Of the around 500,000 single adults experiencing homelessness nationwide, the researchers approximated more than 21,000 of them could require hospitalization with a death toll that could exceed 3,400 over the course of the pandemic.  In Los Angeles, their calculations suggest the hospitalization count could surpass 2,800 and the death toll could be more than 450. Efforts to temporarily house those experiencing homelessness wont come without cost  the report estimated it could take more than $1.7 billion to comprehensively shelter and quarantine the more than 59,000 unsheltered individuals in LA with adequate social distancing.  LA Mayor Eric Garcetti announced at a press conference Friday $16 million was allocated to help fund shelters for people experiencing homelessness and $31 million would go to an Eviction Defense Program that would help prevent people from experiencing homelessness.  He also said 780 hotel and motel rooms were set aside Friday to house vulnerable populations who are experiencing homelessness like seniors experiencing homelessness who have not yet been diagnosed with COVID-19, but are most at risk.  Individuals experiencing homelessness suffer from an accelerated aging effect because of exposure to harsh conditions, making them more susceptible to the disease. An average individual experiencing homelessness typically has the health burdens and needs of someone 15 years older, said Randall Kuhn, a contributor to the report and assistant professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.  You hear about 80-year-olds being at extraordinarily high risk of dying from COVID-19, Kuhn said. That would be like 65 for a homeless person.  The majority of people experiencing homelessness nationwide are over the age of 50, Kuhn said. Half the homeless population in LA falls in that age range, he added.  The largest group of people in the homeless population are kind of late baby boomers ... who have had this long history of homelessness and now tend to be 55 to 60, he said.  Even under normal circumstances, individuals experiencing homelessness spend more time in public, are exposed to public surfaces and typically do not have access to soap or sanitizer, which are integral to combatting this virus, Kuhn added.  The findings come in light of a rise of COVID-19 infections among the population of people experiencing homelessness in LA. There are currently 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases among individuals experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles, including one suspected of being in a shelter while contagious, said Barbara Ferrer, the director of the LA County Department of Public Health, in a press conference Tuesday.  Shelters have been posed as a temporary solution for people experiencing homelessness because they can have access to screening and testing as well as basic needs, but they still pose a risk of transmission, Kuhn said.  Shelters for those experiencing homelessness often pack hundreds of people into a single room with little air and with high rates of people who are immunocompromised, said Dennis Culhane, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of the study.  The shelters are certainly a sort of cauldron of risk for contracting the virus, Culhane said.  Thomas Byrne, an assistant professor in the department of social welfare policy at Boston University and co-author of the study, said it is important for legislators to think creatively to find sources of accommodation, such as hotels, motels and dorm rooms, to house people experiencing homelessness during the crisis.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a  partnership  with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday to find hotels and motels in order to house individuals experiencing homelessness during the crisis.  For students experiencing housing insecurity, the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a volatile and dangerous situation, said Jessica Richards, a community health sciences graduate student at UCLA.  Homelessness changes on an hourly basis, making it difficult for students experiencing homelessness to find safe spaces, she said.  The problem of being homeless or housing insecure is already a really volatile situation. And when you add a crisis like COVID-19 on top of that, you have the potential for really exacerbating an already bad problem.""","['cap-phoebe-chen', 'cap-bernard-mendez']","['national', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.coronahomeless.file_.jpg

Majid Sarrafzadeh, a computer science professor who specializes in health analytics, created the tool Olivia to reduce the difficulty of generating models and understanding data science.  &#8220;Our goal always is to make science accessible to everyone,&#8221; said Sarrafzadeh. &#8220;And I literally mean everyone. And I think Olivia is one step toward that.""  Sarrafzadeh, who works at UCLA&#8217;s eHealth Research Lab, collected data from prominent coronavirus data sources, including Johns Hopkins University, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. census statistics, among other sources to create a central hub for coronavirus-related information.  Olivia can generate a statistical model using a range of variables, including age, gender and racial demographics depending on what the user wants to investigate.  For example, Sarrafzadeh created a model of how the Native American demographic has been impacted by the coronavirus since January, when coronavirus-related data was first collected.  Nothing looked abnormal at first, but when Sarrafzadeh adjusted the tool to look at counties in Arizona, Sarrafzadeh realized counties with dense Native American populations had disproportionately high coronavirus death rates compared to communities with less dense Native American populations, he said.  &#8220;Now it's for one of my colleagues in social science or public policy to figure out what the reason is,&#8221; Sarrafzadeh said. &#8220;It's not our job. We are data scientists.&#8221;   The team at the eHealth Research Lab hopes to use Olivia to predict trends related to the coronavirus, Sarrafzadeh said. They hope to branch out to subjects unrelated to COVID-19 in the future by adding data related to heart failure, mental health and the environment, among other topics, he said.   There are a lot of ways a user can narrow their interests to use the tool in a valuable way, said Davina Zamanzadeh, a computer science graduate student who used Olivia.   Zamanzadeh investigated states in the U.S. with similar gross domestic product to find trends between poverty and the cumulative death rate from the coronavirus. Some states showed a correlation while others she distinguished as outliers.  Once outliers are identified, the user can investigate the causes behind deviations, which can help advance research or inform the average user on the state of the coronavirus, she said.  The team strives for ease of use and transparency, said Anaelia Ovalle, a graduate student in computer science student who worked on the project.  &#8220;Across various institutions in the United States, not a lot of data is being shared, or if it is, it's really hard to find or access and understand,&#8221; Ovalle said. &#8220;We want to do all those things at once.&#8221; ",['cap-keaton-larson'],"['news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.news_.covidolivia.SJ_.jpg

For UCLA students, that support and guidance don't just come from university administration or state legislators &#8211; it should include their student government as well, the Undergraduate Students Association Council.  USAC may not be the natural choice when it comes to who to turn to in the midst of a crisis, but now more than ever, USAC has a vital role to play in the lives of all undergraduates.  The time has come for USAC to reaffirm its commitment to the students it was elected to serve. At a time when the UCLA administration has been  far from perfect  in reacting to this COVID-19 crisis, students need their government to advocate for them.   But for USAC to effectively fulfill this role, it can&#8217;t afford to be distracted by its upcoming election. Shifting the focus too much to election politics runs the risk of alienating students who need help right now and are looking to their student government in this time of crisis. USAC needs to leave campaigning to the candidates and do the job that it was sworn in to do &#8211; which is to advocate for students.   Unfortunately, it seems that some of the council members seeking reelection are more focused on their campaigns than their current contributions, as the Elections Board had to  sanction  candidates who were recruiting for their offices before the election had even taken place.  This, coupled with potential new student fees and  attacks  on students over criticisms regarding it, will only further alienate its voters at a time when USAC needs to reestablish itself as an ally for students.    And preferably, it should do so without the distractions and squabbling that comes with an election and new referendums.   &#8220;I think that USAC&#8217;s public image is heavily dependent on what we do at this time because a lot of students are watching and a lot of students at this time do have a strong opinion about the things we are working on,&#8221; said USAC General Representative 2 Orion Smedley, a third-year physics student.  It has been clear from the beginning that almost everyone was unprepared for this situation, UCLA included.  The university was insisting that in-person classes would be back by the second week of spring quarter when universities across the country were in the process of moving classes  online  for the rest of the year.  In an effort to recalibrate its response, UCLA went to the other extreme and announced via  tweet  that commencement would be canceled and a virtual ceremony would take its place.  But not without an unsympathetic quote to soften the blow.  &#8220;That whole &#8216;the day does not define the journey,&#8217; that was said from someone who doesn&#8217;t get it,"" said Helen Bui, a fourth-year psychobiology student. ""There are (first-generation) students and people have struggled so hard just to graduate and it means a lot, and to have that taken away from you was really upsetting.&#8221;   When the graduation decision was made, USAC urged UCLA to reconsider its decision and circulated a petition to gather students in opposition. During the uncertainty surrounding finals during winter quarter, USAC  lobbied  the administration to be more lenient with students.  USAC stepped up and advocated for students' needs and its actions surely improved its reputation among the student body temporarily. But now, it   must show students how USAC can serve them on a more permanent basis &#8211; and in doing so, illustrate its continued commitment to the UCLA community.  But as of now, it has failed at keeping that momentum going. Instead, the council has been distracted by a contentious    referendum  on the USAC elections ballot.  Angelynn Nguyen, a first-year political science and microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics student, said that she wasn&#8217;t happy when she found out about a proposal on the ballot to increase student fees by $15 per quarter.  &#8220;I feel like students expect the student government to step up &#8211; they should function like any other government. When something like this happens, you turn to the people in charge and see what they are going to do, ""  Nguyen said. ""In this case, I don't think USAC is responding appropriately.&#8221;   Regardless of council members' personal beliefs on the referendum in question, USAC has little room for error &#8211; especially with current levels of engagement on campus looking increasingly dismal. After all, only 16% of students came out to  vote  in the last election, and now, students won't even be on campus in the first place.  &#8220;There's this metaphor of the ivory tower, of these people sitting up in this ivory tower making decisions and just not caring what everybody around them is saying,&#8221; said USAC President Robert Watson, a fourth-year political science student. &#8220;We need to make USAC accessible. Give students the opportunity and they will show up and they will show out.&#8221;  The job of a student government representative is difficult even in normal circumstances and USAC has certainly done its part to help alleviate the stress of students &#8211; but that work has to be sustained in order to ensure USAC&#8217;s success in the long run.  However, council members need to focus on the jobs they have now &#8211; that is, being student body representatives &#8211; as opposed to the bickering and infighting of an election season that pales in comparison to the struggles students are facing in the current moment.    It&#8217;s no secret that USAC isn&#8217;t the most trusted or well-liked organization on campus, but that comes with the territory.   But right now, the council is at a crossroads &#8211; and the survival of UCLA&#8217;s student government hinges on the choices that are made at this critical moment.

In total, 59 UCLA professors and faculty co-signed a  letter  addressed to UCLA Chancellor Gene Block and the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Emily Carter requesting the administration give a detailed account of its communications with the LAPD as well as take concrete steps to divest from the LAPD.  The letter stated protesters were held on buses in the parking lot of the Jackie Robinson Stadium for hours without access to food, water, information or medical attention. Social distancing was not observed. Detainees were released without working phones at between 1:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. and left to find their way home under curfew conditions, the letter stated.   [Related link:    UCLA-leased Jackie Robinson Stadium facilities used by LAPD to detain protestors   ]   The faculty who signed the letter wanted to act quickly to prevent the stadium from being used again to process arrests, said Ananya Roy, a professor of urban planning, social welfare and geography who led the faculty in addressing the university.  &#8220;You cannot put out solidarity statements and say that you feel the pain behind the protests if you are allowing this to happen on UCLA facilities,&#8221; Roy said.  UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez said in a statement Tuesday that UCLA had no knowledge of LAPD&#8217;s use of the Jackie Robinson Stadium as a ""field jail"" and that it will not grant the LAPD permission to use the stadium as such in the future.  Block, along with three other vice chancellors, said in a  statement  Wednesday that UCLA was aware that LAPD was using the stadium but was not aware that the LAPD was processing arrests on site.  &#8220;The LAPD sought and received similar permissions from the (Veterans Affairs) to use the stadium parking lot as a staging area, which we knew about and failed to stop,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;We were never informed that it would also be used to process arrests.&#8221;  The statement did not specify whether UCLA made an effort to prevent the LAPD from using the property. However, UCLA had the legal power to deny any third party, including the LAPD, from using the Jackie Robinson Stadium, said Gary Blasi, a law professor at UCLA.  &#8220;Under the terms of the lease, the VA can only allow others to use the property that UCLA leased with the expressed permission of UCLA,&#8221; Blasi said.  Blasi also said he found it disturbing that this happened at a stadium named after Jackie Robinson, the first African American Major League Baseball player, especially because authoritarian states have historically used stadiums as concentration camps for protesters.  Roy said the faculty are alarmed by UCLA&#8217;s lack of action following the events of June 1.  &#8220;It&#8217;s very worrisome to us that what was a massive detention and arrest processing operation was set up and run for most likely 10 to 12 hours on a UCLA facility, and the leadership didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a huge problem.&#8221;  In another  letter  responding to Block&#8217;s statement, faculty members said they were disturbed by UCLA&#8217;s intentional omission of the full truth. The faculty said UCLA administration withheld the fact that they knew the LAPD was using the site as a staging area.  The faculty said they were troubled by UCLA&#8217;s unwillingness to recognize the direct connection between the request for the staging area and the subsequent detainment of protesters.  &#8220;Are we as scholars under the impression that the police hand out lemonade to protesters at these &#8216;staging areas&#8217;?&#8221; the letter stated.  Active collaborations with the police contradict the statements of solidarity with protests against racial injustices that UCLA recently issued, the letter added.  The follow-up letter emphasized the need for UCLA to publish all relevant communications with the LAPD and to seek compensation if the LAPD&#8217;s use of the property was unauthorized by the university. The faculty also plans to form a Divestment Working Group that will propose policy recommendations for UCLA to fully sever ties with the LAPD.  Laura Abrams, a social welfare professor who signed the letter, said many people detained June 1 were peaceful protesters who stood up against injustices and said she was shocked that these events took place at a UCLA facility.  The LAPD said in an emailed statement that the use of the stadium was needed to process a surge of curfew-related arrests.  Abrams said the implementation of curfews has historically been used to deter protests in the U.S. and across the globe.  &#8220;(Curfews are meant) to inspire fear and to make sure that people aren&#8217;t protesting after a certain time,&#8221; Abrams said. &#8220;This is not an uncommon tactic to suppress protests.&#8221;  The Jackie Robinson Stadium was donated to the federal government specifically for the purpose of the use of wounded veterans in the late 19th century, Blasi said.  &#8220;UCLA promised as part of its lease obligations to do a lot more than they have actually done for veterans,&#8221; Blasi added. &#8220;This is injustice, piled on top of injustice, piled on top of injustice.&#8221; ",['cap-genesis-qu'],"['campus', 'los-angeles', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.news_.facultyresponse.KM_.jpg

I watched a bunch of YouTube videos, and a lot of them said, Oh yeah, you make most of your friends at freshman orientation, Ke said. Since its virtual, it's going to be pretty hard to do that.  Nicole Muttera, an incoming first-year physiological sciences student from San Diego, said being close to the school has helped her make a smooth transition.  Thankfully, my roommate lives in San Diego with me, so we can hopefully meet, and Ive actually gone up to see the campus already, Muttera said. I just dont really know what happens in each of the buildings, so orientation wouldve been nice in that aspect. It would have been exciting to meet a ton of people.  NSTP is working to create opportunities for students to bond over Zoom, Neal said.  I think the bigger areas where a lot of students connect are in their smaller groups with their NSA, and that obviously will still be there, she said. We're creating some programming where the groups get to just hang out and talk about transitioning to college and what theyre excited about doing.  Students will still be able to attend an activities fair. Normally, orientation sessions include the Summer in the Union Activities Fair to introduce students to various organizations on campus. The online fair will host an unlimited number of student organizations, which will make it comparable to the Enormous Activities Fair held during week zero, Neal said. Incoming freshmen will use Zoom to talk to representatives from student groups about their organizations.  Typically, transfer orientation does not include an activities fair due to its time constraint. However, the flexibility of the online platform allows it to also be offered to transfer students, Neal said.  Though some aspects of orientation will be moved online, in-person campus tours and Bruintizing ceremonies will still take place when students return to campus. In the meantime, virtual tours will be given instead, Neal said.  I was really looking forward to being on campus for orientation, said Yvette Stoffels, an incoming transfer third-year physiological sciences student from Portland, Oregon. Theres so much more emotion and excitement with meeting new people, attending in-person seminars and even the dumb stuff like picking out my outfit and getting ready for the day. Instead, my first impression is over FaceTime in my pajamas.  International students will have some time zone flexibility because of the large number of presentations that will be recorded, Neal said. For one-on-one live appointments, NSTP will try to match students with advisors at times that work for both of them.  We're trying our hardest to work out solutions where the international students won't have to wake up in the middle of the night to take an appointment, Neal said.  Incoming first-year economics student Meha Mukherjee lives in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, which is 11 hours ahead of the time in Los Angeles.  I'm staying up pretty late anyways because there's not much to do, so I would be fine with (late meetings) because I think I would be up anyways, Mukherjee said. If a certain time would be convenient for someone in California, then I'd be fine with conforming to that, especially if it's something that will help me, like academic advising.  If orientation had been held in person, Mukherjee said she would not have attended because of the long flight. She added that the opportunity to attend an online orientation might provide her with information she might not have received under normal circumstances.  Many are also concerned about the possibility of fall quarter moving online.  One of the reasons I chose UCLA is that there's a whole new experience to be in Los Angeles compared to New Jersey. I feel like we're going to be missing a lot on that, Ke said. I could be going to community college at home doing the same thing.  Current high school seniors who lost their prom and graduation could potentially lose their start of college too, Muttera said.  For two years Ive been working my butt off to get into UCLA, and now that Ive achieved my goal, everything is online, Stoffels said.  NSTP will send all incoming students who sign up for orientation a package with all of the merchandise they would have received if they had attended in person, Neal said.  We're spending our creative time thinking, How can we make this as fantastic as we can under these circumstances? Neal said. We really want to show the students that we are so excited that they're coming to UCLA and becoming Bruins with the rest of us. Were trying to make it an experience where they really look forward to fall quarter and their new journey.",['cap-samantha-fredberg'],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/news.orientation.km_.2.jpg

Student organizations face newfound struggles as a result of the transition to  remote instruction  for spring quarter in light of the novel coronavirus outbreak.   Dealing with Canceled Events   Luong&#8217;s club, UCA, provides workshops and resources to help students prepare for a career in communications. While the club did not dissolve, it had to call off its chief networking event after UCLA  canceled all nonessential campus events  in response to the novel coronavirus.  Other clubs also had their spring quarter plans changed because of UCLA&#8217;s mandate.  The Pediatric AIDS Coalition at UCLA usually hosts events to celebrate members&#8217; yearlong work in the spring, but because of current circumstances it could not give its members the typical in-person celebration, said Sophie Ahmad, president of the organization.  &#8220;(I) just kind of (feel) bad almost for everyone having to dedicate so much time and energy and then not really getting the whole celebratory aspect of it,&#8221; said Ahmad, a fourth-year neuroscience and Spanish student.  Ahmad said they are currently figuring out what they can offer their members in place of celebrating together in person.  PAC also had to move its  Dance Marathon  online this year. Dance Marathon is an annual event held in Pauley Pavilion to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS.  Yukta Trivedi, co-president of the Photography Club at UCLA, said it planned to organize a photo gallery for its members to present their best photos in the Kerckhoff Art Gallery before the UCLA mandate, which would have been its first showcase event after the club was revived last year.  Additionally, the club canceled its weekly outings to photograph places around Los Angeles, which is a major component of the club, said Trivedi, a third-year business economics student.  To address the cancellation of its weekly outings and photo gallery, the club has been putting out weekly indoor photo challenges for members to do, and club leaders are considering creating a magazine or scrapbook to highlight members&#8217; best photos, Trivedi said.   Maintaining engagement   Several club leaders said maintaining a connection with members was an issue.  &#8220;One of the biggest questions that I had ... (was) how do we keep everybody still engaged and feel a part of the club?&#8221; Samantha Chandra, president of 180 Degrees Consulting at UCLA.  Currently, 180DC hosts Zoom meetings for various activities, such as playing Pictionary online, and uses messaging apps like Slack and Facebook Messenger to engage members.  Some clubs struggled with electing or training leaders.  Jonathan Sung, president of the Korean American Student Association, said his club was concerned with ensuring a full election cycle to appoint new leaders. Sung added they are working on maintaining engagement with members and issuing club T-shirts to their members.  Chandra, a fourth-year business economics student, said her club had issues moving its election online because election season is normally the time for members to bond over the future of the club and raise club spirit.  &#8220;Having elections be online is very demoralizing ... because election is usually when everyone comes together,&#8221; Chandra said.  180DC&#8217;s election took place through Zoom on Monday.  UCA already elected its leaders during winter quarter, so they struggled with brainstorming ideas for how to train the incoming leadership, Luong said.   Problem Solving   Student Organizations, Leadership and Engagement is offering resources for campus organizations struggling to adjust to the transition to remote instruction. SOLE, an office run by UCLA, assists registered campus organizations with their activities and reserves Bruin Plaza for them.  Every registered campus organization is assigned a SOLE advisor to help guide them, and SOLE recommended registered clubs reach out to their advisors in an email at the beginning of spring quarter.  Clubs varied in their approach to solving their respective problems. Some used their SOLE advisor for guidance.  UCA resolved its issues through some creativity and a consultation with its SOLE advisor, Michael Gamez, who helped the club brainstorm different virtual events.  UCA now plans to hold webinars to teach incoming board members their responsibilities and practice common situations that the board faces. Luong said the process made the outgoing board more hopeful.  &#8220;We started at ... 50% but (now) it&#8217;s up to 85% in terms of morale,&#8221; Luong said. &#8220;We&#8217;re still very disappointed, you know obviously, that we can&#8217;t have the events we were planning to have, but ... we&#8217;re feeling a little bit better.&#8221;  Ahmad said her club frequently contacted its SOLE advisor Pamela Cysner prior to remote instruction, and Cysner continued to be a reliable resource for guidance and support during the transition. For instance, when it came to moving Dance Marathon online, Cysner gave her full support by expressing her trust in their abilities, Ahmad said.  &#8220;We knew ... someone from UCLA was on our side,&#8221; Ahmad said.  Ahmad added she spoke to other organizations to learn how their groups were adapting to the new circumstance and maintaining engagement with members.  PAC has been doing a variety of events and activities for members to stay connected with the club. It has created recommendation documents for members to list their favorite music and movies, and members also participated in a PAC-themed cake-baking competition, Ahmad said.  180DC also used the advice of other student groups to solve its problems, but did not contact its SOLE advisor for help. Chandra said 180DC typically does not contact its SOLE advisor and they are not sure how useful their insight can be to run their student organization.  &#8220;I have a better chance of figuring out what to do by talking to other student leaders and ... talking to other 180DC branches,&#8221; Chandra said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if SOLE is going to be able to give me that insight, especially because they are adults and they don&#8217;t live in the student world.&#8221;  The Photography Club also did not consult its SOLE advisor. Trivedi said they are more of a relaxed and casual club, so they have not had any problems pressing enough to call their advisor.  KASA figured out how it would turnover current staff to next year&#8217;s staff and plans on helping its incoming leaders transition to their roles digitally, said Sung, a third-year economics student.  They are also using various communication outlets to maintain engagement with members, such as their Facebook page, Slack, Discord and more, Sung said.  Although KASA does not heavily depend on SOLE, Sung said he thinks SOLE could have provided more resources to help their members adjust to the transition, instead of having organizations independently seek out more individualized help through their SOLE advisor.  Receiving such updates would have helped the board keep KASA members in the loop, especially at the beginning of the transition to remote instruction, Sung said.  SOLE could also have been more personal with its help, Ahmad said.  &#8220;The emails I&#8217;ve been getting for the most part that are on behalf of the SOLE office have been like,  &#8216;Dear Signatories,&#8217; ... where I&#8217;m like &#8216;OK, no, this is a mass email I&#8217;m getting,&#8217;&#8221; Ahmad said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t want me to click on that email specifically.&#8221;  Ahmad said the emails could have been catered to clubs and addressed concerns they might have because of the transition.   SOLE Resources   SOLE Director Mike Cohn said SOLE is doing its best to provide resources for organizations to cope with the new circumstances.  Organizations can use Zoom Pro accounts, which are provided to all UCLA students, to host meetings of up to 100 participants for up to 24 hours. One-on-one meetings on Zoom do not have time limits.  SOLE also suggested organizations take advantage of  Google Meet , now free until Sept. 30, with features such as meetings with a 250-participant maximum, livestreaming for 100,000 viewers per domain and the option to record meetings and save those recordings on Google Drive.  SOLE also provided its own digital resources for organizations to use, including its  website ,  Facebook page ,  Youtube ,  RCO funding system ,  the UCLA   Bruin Leaders Program Instagram , and more.  SOLE will also be sending out newsletters, which will include resources and suggestions for engagement, to signatories to help their organization adjust to the transition, Cohn said.  &#8220;This is brand new,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;We're putting together things that are happening around the country that are (of) value ... we're thinking of new ideas. I meet with the staff regularly and we're going to continue to put out more and more information in our newsletters.&#8221; ",['cap-kari-lau'],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.clorgs.file_.jpg

The Canadian musician   dropped his fourth studio album &#8220;After Hours&#8221; on Friday, following the release of his extended play record &#8220;My Dear Melancholy,"" in 2018. The album, composed of 14 tracks, traverses the singer's journey of heartbreak and acknowledging his own wrongdoings in a relationship that ultimately met its demise. Also known as Abel Tesfaye, The Weeknd expresses regret over his past mistakes with a former lover in ""After Hours"" and promises personal change while revealing his evolved, candid honesty.   &#8220;Alone Again&#8221; opens the album with a slow-paced, rippling wave of beats alongside distorted and echoing vocals. Halfway into the song, the once-calm beat speeds up and takes on a futuristic sound, similar to that of his previous album, &#8220;Starboy.&#8221; As The Weeknd sings ""Take off my disguise, I'm living someone else's life"" and ""I don't know if I can be alone again,"" he provokes an immediate feel of loneliness and reflection. The song sets the stage for an album covering The Weeknd's feelings of despair upon the realization that he lost a beloved.  Still feeling distraught after losing a former partner, The Weeknd acknowledges his poor behavior in their relationship in &#8220;Too Late.&#8221; The song&#8217;s chopped-up electronic sound matches its acceptance of a relationship that is broken beyond repair. While he battles to accept his lover's absence, he also continues to lust over the thought of winning them back. The track&#8217;s sensual sound compliments the singer's rich vocals as he expresses his honesty of being unable to achieve redemption.    [Related:    Album review: Niall Horan departs from typical acoustic ballads in emotional narrative record   ]   The first few songs of the album commonly discuss a torn relationship, but each track takes on a distinct interpretation of how the singer is coping. ""Scared To Live"" plays on a minimalistic and slow beat, which allows The Weeknd to showcase his vibrant vocals as he hits each delicate high note. Although The Weeknd seems to have damaged his former partner&#8217;s heart, he hopes they find peace and move on to love again as he sings, ""Don't be scared to live again."" The Weeknd delivers a sincere confession of wrongs inflicted upon a relationship through his remorseful lyrics.   As The Weeknd tells the story of a former lover, easter eggs from his past releases are scattered throughout his most recent LP. &#8220;Snowchild&#8221; features the lyrics &#8220;Cali was the mission,&#8221; which mirror those from the track &#8220;The Morning&#8221; from his 2012 &#8220;Trilogy&#8221; project. While he expresses in &#8220;The Morning&#8221; the desire to work hard to live a life of luxury, &#8220;Showchild&#8221; features a contrasting tone. Rather, the singer reveals he is ready to leave his success and material goods &#8211; such as diamonds and cars &#8211; behind.   While most songs on the album indicate how The Weeknd desires to get back with a former flame, others express his conflicting wish to be single. The emotional contrast allows the singer to play a spirited devil's advocate with himself by proclaiming to need love but knowing he is subpar at maintaining a healthy relationship. The record's seventh song, &#8220;Heartless,&#8221; illustrates this acceptance of being unable to fully devote oneself to a partner. It is packed with a range of pounding and rhythmic electronic beats and sounds that work together to create a multidimensional energized atmosphere.   [Related:    Album review: BTS spans genres in introspective release but fails to maintain quality throughout   ]   The thread of losing oneself in addition to a romantic partner   is continued on the album's eighth track &#8220;Faith,"" in which the singer opens up about his inability to love another person. The track plays with a beat that slows down and speeds up, introducing a playful twist to the woeful song. ""Faith"" provides a smooth transition into &#8220;Blinding Lights,&#8221; which brings an upbeat tune paired with the singer's yearning for attention and love from a former partner. Yet again, a techno-disco sound plays as The Weeknd uses the musical genre to his advantage.  While songs on &#8220;After Hours&#8221; are audibly vibrant, they are also visually stimulating. The lyrics of ""In Your Eyes"" describe the singer seeing his lover in pain and feeling disdain for not acknowledging that they are hurting. The track features a mixture of instruments, such as an electric piano and a saxophone that introduces itself midway into the song. A sensual sound attached to the song provides a groovy and uplifting feel to the track's sorrowful lyrics. The contracting sound and lyrics present a refreshingly interpretive take to the heavy emotional matter.  As the cohesive album covers the themes of love and faults, its songs do get repetitive with similar upbeat sounds and lyrics at times. Yet, despite covering similar regretful sentiments throughout ""After Hours,"" The Weeknd manages to express his raw and authentic emotions. He seeks to make amends with his past, but what The Weeknd's romantic future holds is still to be determined.

The club was founded this year when co-president Chris Tai and two of his friends couldnt find an active origami club at UCLA, said the first-year microbiology, immunology &amp; molecular genetics student. As an underclassman, Tai said he started the club in part because he wanted to watch himself grow alongside the club and learn more about the club formation process. Members of the club meet other people over the video conference platform Zoom, Tai said, while folding origami and chatting about the craft.  (We) originally planned for meetings to start during spring quarter in-person. We already reserved the rooms and everything, Tai said. But since there (are) some extenuating circumstances, it's not really possible.""   [Related:    New club would allow students to experiment with metal and glass creations   ]   So far, members of Bruin Origami for All have worked on models such as the origami crane and rocket. The club is starting off with simpler models to ensure members of the club  regardless of their skill level  can follow along the instruction, Tai said.  The art of origami involves folding pieces of paper to create specific shapes, ranging from real life to abstract, said Mark Diamond, co-president of the club. The first-year mechanical engineering student said while origami is traditionally a solitary experience, he enjoys leading origami lessons over Zoom and sharing knowledge of the craft with others through conversations about the art form. Crafting origami birds ranges per difficulty level, Diamond said, the easiest being a swan and crane. The crane is a quintessential origami piece, he said, and a good model for beginners to learn the craft due to its low complexity.  ""The crane is (a) perfect, very symmetrical model,"" Diamond said. ""They're very big folds that are not very precise ... (there's) more leniency to make mistakes or imprecisions.""  Utilizing Zooms breakout rooms feature, the club plans on hosting separate guided instructions over the platform tailored to beginners and more advanced learners of origami. Bruin Origami for All tries to engage club members to build a community with each other, said Benny Lau, a second-year biology student. Serving as the clubs vice president, Lau said he wants to focus on good camera lighting, since it can be difficult to see origami paper on video.  ""I think we're trying to do as best as we can to simulate being like a club meeting,"" Lau said. ""We're trying to get all the members to be talking to each other, to ask questions and just get to know each other.""   [Related:    English Fiat Lux classes center around understanding, studying COVID-19s impacts   ]   Engaging with others during nationwide lockdown orders is difficult, said Elaine Chao, a first-year chemistry student. Despite the occasional challenges with video calls, Chao said she appreciated the efficiency of the camera set up  one screen showing a recording of an instructional origami video and the other recording the instructor. The club provides a welcoming environment, Chao said, since club members range from beginner to advanced origami skill levels.  ""I feel like I have a lot more free time now,"" Chao said. ""It (has) been a lot of fun to go pick up another hobby.""  The club plans on folding a thousand cranes as a community service project, Chao said. Donating the cranes symbolizes hope    one Japanese legend claims that folding a thousand cranes will grant a wish to a person, she said. Making origami as a gift to a person also represents an investment in time, Tai said, because every piece requires thought and energy.  When Bruin Origami For All resumes in-person meetings, Tai said the club hopes to engage in community service projects with local organizations, such as UCLA Residential Life.   Bruin Origami For All wants to explore opportunities for campus beautification projects, and even donating origami creations to UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital.  I think one of the main vision points of BOFA is that we want to serve our community through the gift of origami, Tai said. We don't just want to fold origami for ourselves ... or have these origami trophies, but it's more to bless and to serve our community.",['cap-alexsandra-coltun-schneider'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ae_.bofa_.adx-copy.jpg

On April 19, second-year dance student Audrey Lees clothing line On Brand LA launched its first collection online. Comprised of tie-dyed, cropped tees and tank tops, Lee works with her immediate family members to create and ship   the pieces to audiences across the globe. Inspired by the general popularity of tie-dye, Lee said she wanted her first collection to be her personal take on the trend, with meaningful color schemes inspired by film and television   characters paired with versatile, comfortable shirt styles.  Ive always seen that other brands are always out of stock or theyre one size fits all, Lee said. I wanted to branch out to all sorts of audiences, no matter age, shape or size, and I wanted to put my own spin on these trends.  Lee said her brand name is derived from the popular phrase Thats so on brand, alluding to being a perfect fit or encapsulating ones personality. Lee said she found her own personal brand by drawing upon fashion influences, even naming some of her products after them.  These inspirations include Elio from Call Me by Your Name and Rue and Jules from Euphoria, along with her sister, Amanda. She said she hopes each colorway is able to pay homage to her fashion influences, using color schemes that remind her of them. For her shirt named Elio Tank, Lee uses pink and red tie-dye colors inspired by an outfit the character Elio wears in the film Call Me by Your Name.   [Related:    Design media arts student debuts latest collection at New York Fashion Week   ]   Having wanted to create a clothing line for many years, Lee said she was motivated to make the most of her time in quarantine and jump-started her idea two weeks ago. She said she wanted to capitalize on the trend of tie-dye, and   since she already had many of the materials needed, she sent out prototypes of her cropped, tie-dyed shirts to her friends and family.  However, Lee said determining a reasonable yet profitable price point has been a challenge to navigate amid a stark drop in consumers disposable income due to the pandemic. She also said that COVID-19 has emphasized the newfound importance of sanitation in the creation of her garments, requiring all people making her shirts to wear a mask and two pairs of gloves as they tie-dye.  The pandemic affects not only the logistics of the apparel businesses, Lee said, but also alters people's fashion taste. Katie LaFrance, a second-year gender studies student, said consumers are gravitating toward more comfortable clothing with stay-at-home orders in effect.  It seems crazy now, if youre just going to be sitting on your couch all day, to put on a pair of jeans if you dont have to, LaFrance said. (The consumer) is only interested in loungewear now because we cant really do anything at the moment.

(Courtesy of Audrey Lee)[/caption]  LaFrance said On Brand LAs collection plays into this changing consumer trend, offering customers a more affordable and stylish version of traditional loungewear. With hand-cropped shirts and a tie-dye pattern unique to every garment, she said the customizability also adds a personal touch to the collection.   [Related:    Students thrift to create sustainable, affordable fashion line inspired by UCLA   ]   Faith Lee, a first-year pre-psychobiology student, said the brand also   allows customers to vote on what future collections will be. She said the brand   sends out surveys on what people would want to see and takes into account Instagram comments and feedback from customers.  I feel like for other brands, you cant really say what you would want to see and have it actually happen, Faith Lee said. (On Brand LA) is really authentic.  Audrey Lee said there have been many customers from her home state of California, as well as orders from other continents. Not only is she planning for this global expansion, but she said she aims to expand her product line as well. While there is a sweat-set collection coming soon, Audrey Lee said she hopes to put out more collections that cater to the chic, effortless quality of the European and Parisian styles she has been researching.   However, for now, she said she wants to maintain simplicity and focus on engaging with customers to build her fan base.  I love to see how each of my customers style my product in their own way and on their own brand, Audrey Lee said. Seeing how customers use these different pieces that I put all my passions to express their style and their brand in a different way is the most rewarding part.",['cap-natalie-brown'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/Image-from-iOS-7-1.jpg

T  he National Multifamily Housing Council  reported  that in just the first five days of April, 31% of renters   in 13.4 million units across the nation were unable to make payments.         In late March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom  announced  an eviction moratorium, which would delay tenants from being evicted from their residence until May 31. However, renters must qualify for the delay by verifying that they lost income as a result of COVID-19.  And all the while,   rent payments and potential evictions are awaiting residents come June.    Individual cities are allowed to take stronger actions to protect renters, but no extra guidelines were given and not every city has adopted stricter eviction bans.  Fortunately ,  Los Angeles was one of a few cities to   provide further relief. Before Newsom's order,   LA City Council officials  announced  a moratorium on evictions  .   Furthermore, renters would have a year after the end of the state of the emergency to pay the rent owed, late fees would be waived, and Mayor Eric Garcetti  announced  that all rent hikes will be frozen in Los Angeles till the end of the pandemic.  The state of California should follow the lead of cities like Los Angeles and extend both mortgage and rent relief in a clear, sweeping fashion. For students and low-income populations especially, a full ban on evictions is the only way to mitigate the massive economic fallout created by COVID-19. This way, renters and landlords alike do not have to worry about how the situation will change week by week and tenants will not be taken advantage of during this unprecedented time.  Unfortunately, the City of Los Angeles has  failed  to pass an eviction ban that would cover all tenants  those evicted will still have to defend themselves in a court. And regardless of mortgage relief packages, some landlords have taken  advantage  of the uncertainty to exploit tenants.  The lack of uniform guidelines and information puts tenants in a difficult position in which they might pay rent even if they cannot afford it for fear that landlords could retaliate through legal loopholes or will fight for evictions in court. And amidst a global pandemic, legal issues should be the last thing tenants are worried about.    And with experts unsure of when the crisis will end, legal uncertainties feel indefinite.  Students living off-campus at UCLA will face an additional set of problems considering classes will be conducted remotely through the end of  spring quarter , as well as  Summer Session A .  This means leaving students with leases that they might not be able to terminate early  forcing them to pay months of rent for an empty apartment.  Andrea Gonzlez, a third-year cognitive science student   from Mexico, said that she would like to eventually   go home  .   However,   she cannot terminate her lease early and will have to continue to pay rent until September, regardless of whether she is living there or not.  I think (COVID-19) counts as some sort of disaster, something thats out of the ordinary  and I think their response should be out of the ordinary,"" Gonzlez said. ""I feel like (landlords) should be more understanding of the situation.""    Gonzlez is right  a pandemic, a transition to remote instruction and the subsequent financial hardship and mental distress of the situation seem extraordinary, to say the least. Despite this, these factors are not  considered  sufficient   legal grounds to terminate a lease.  Elizabeth Kemper, director of UCLA Student Legal Services, said that her office has tried to work with students to discuss their legal options for early lease termination.  Unfortunately, for most students, theres no legal basis for terminating their lease early, but both the city and the state have provided some relief on evictions,"" Kemper said. ""But thus far, theres been no relief on rent payment with the one exception of the CARES Act  the issue there, though, is it does not forgive the rent or forgive the mortgage payment, it just delays it.""  For those forced to stay near campus, landlords can similarly take advantage of unknowing college students, many of whom are dealing with housing contracts for the first time. While both parties may have willingly   entered into a contract, no one likely foresaw a global pandemic  something that landlords seem to be capitalizing on.  Maria Blandizzi, dean of students and chair of the Economic Crisis Response Team, said the ECR Team and UCLA have worked to provide financial help to students struggling during this crisis, from fulfilling work-study awards to running a meal voucher program.  ""We have three levels of government relations colleagues: the local, the state and the federal,"" Blandizzi said. ""And those three teams work together in concert with each other to do advocacy  we are feeding them data about what our students are experiencing in real-time.""  Of   course, landlords have a business to run and their own payments to make, but more financial protections have been extended toward property owners compared to renters. Newsom also  announced  that Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and 200 state-chartered banks will provide mortgage relief, so that those eligible can defer mortgage payments for 90 days.  Furthermore, the Federal Housing Finance Agency  announced  that owners of multifamily properties can delay mortgage payments as long as they delay evictions.  The lack of clear-cut policy means millions of Californians will fear for their health and homes.   And in a time of uncertainty, the best course of action is always clarity.  LA's smog may be clearing, but the decisions of lawmakers have remained just as foggy.",['cap-navdeep-bal'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.op_.weinerth.sb50.DLB_.jpg

Never Ricking Morty puts the meta to the metal.  Returning after an unusual four-month hiatus, the latter half of the show's fourth season debuted Sunday night. The first episode, Never Ricking Morty, introduces itself as an intergalactic train caper before derailing itself into a series of split-off, meta storylines based on the trains passengers  with varying degrees of success. The train, a literal narrative device, is a promising premise that quickly turns tedious as the metacommentary becomes more concerned with pettiness than insightfulness.  With the fourth wall reduced to rubble, the episode reads as a petulant middle finger to Rick and Morty fans  a warning sign that the show has parodied itself beyond recognition.  Never Ricking Morty begins deceptively like any other episode. Passengers recount brushes with Rick Sanchez such as bizarre Christmas stories filled with evil lairs, third buttcheeks and embarrassing family dinners. Unbeknownst to them, however, a disguised Rick slips through the train to meet his grandson Morty before being accosted by a pectorally gifted ticket inspector.  Shattering the window with gas containers of Continuity, Rick and Morty watch as the inspector is bloodily bisected and sucked into space. Meanwhile, the overhead speaker warns that the train is losing continuity due to the breach  the first event in the episode that actually matters.   [Related:    Alumna author imbues fiction with scientific rigor, feminist principles   ]   None of the scenes leading up to this point are particularly important, a fact Rick is smugly aware of, as he says, stupid vignettes, imagine if thatd been the whole thing! in response to the passengers stories.   And as the episode cuts away to an absurd amount of vignettes, it becomes clear that this schtick is indeed ""the whole thing."" Creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland weaponize the meta nature of the storylines not to advance a character arc or provide meaningful growth, but to continuously one-up viewers with each added layer of irony.  However, from a world building standpoint, the meta elements are used to monumental   effect. After both literally and symbolically breaking the Continuity of the story, Rick and Morty discover the train's path converges in an infinite loop  meaning their stories will never stop unless they infiltrate the engine room and halt the train. The episode cleverly references classic story structures, like Rick crossing the threshold from Joseph Campbells The Heros Journey, to delineate the path the duo are expected to follow, heightening the stakes when they ultimately defy it.  But the shows world building has rarely been the issue. Atop the train, Rick asks Morty to think of a story that satisfies the Bechdel test    a clear nod to criticism the show has sustained over questionable portrayals of women and male-dominated writing rooms.  Instead of using the episode to redress these issues constructively,   Mortys narrative involves his mother and sister Summer discussing their periods and fighting bow-clad scorpions by shooting lasers out of their vaginas. Somehow, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg becomes involved,   dismissively referred to as that judge lady.   Yes, Morty   is a dim-witted, idiotic teenage boy  but his characterization shouldn't be used as an excuse to double down on the sexist tropes the show been criticized for in the past.   [Related:    'Party of Five' Season 1 review  episode 10: 'Diaspora'   ]   After Mortys story satisfies the Bechdel test, the pair reach the engine room and encounter the Story Lord, the trains impossibly buff captain. He straps them to a machine in an attempt to break the fifth wall, hurriedly pushing buttons to control levels of Narrative Energy, Marketability, Broad Appeal and Relatability.  Again, the world building of the control panel's design   executes the meta narrative far more successfully than Ricks pointed remarks at the fanbase and insufferable omniscience. As Rick and Morty shift in and out of scenes with Birdperson musicals and Abradolf Lincler, the trains controls remind viewers of the precarious balance between artistry and carefully manicured optics that Harmon and Roiland   must maintain.  Unfortunately, the episode quickly returns to its holier-than-thou stance  literally. An intensely ripped Jesus Christ appears before Rick and Morty after they realize they can defeat the Story Lord by praying, framed as an action they would never do. In a hopeful glimpse of self-awareness, Morty asks Rick if a Christianity punchline is a cheap shot at fans. Rick, of course, brushes this off alongside any redemption of the episode.  While Rick and Morty has always tested the flexibility of the sci-fi genre      often in hilarious and visually captivating ways  it rarely must contend with itself and its place within the genre.   In Never Ricking Morty, however, Rick and Morty are relegated to shotgun side characters in their own story while Harmon and Roiland steer the train  perhaps into the ground.",['cap-kaia-sherry'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.rickandmorty.courtesy.jpg

Q: How long does the novel coronavirus last on some surfaces?  A: A team of researchers at UCLA, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Princeton University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discovered that COVID-19 can remain infectious on plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard from several hours to days, depending on the surface.  The study, published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine, compared the environmental stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, which is the strain causing the current coronavirus outbreak, and SARS-CoV-1, the strain that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak. Environmental stability refers to how long the virus remains infectious in the environment.  The results showed that the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 under the experimental conditions, with the virus remaining viable in aerosols for three hours and on plastics and stainless steel for up to 72 hours.  SARS-CoV-2 was able to live for up to four hours on copper and 24 hours on cardboard, differing from SARS-CoV-1 which was found to be viable for 8 hours on both materials.  The objective of the study was to compare SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV-1 to understand if the difference in epidemiological trend, the pattern of virus distribution, between the two strains is due to a difference in environmental stability, said Amandine Gamble, a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA who co-authored the study.  If everything was equal for these two viruses, if symptoms are the same, stability in the environment is the same and replication rate in people is the same and so on, then you would expect the two viruses to follow exactly the same epidemiological trend, Gamble said.  The results suggest that the rapid spread of the current outbreak is not due to greater environmental stability, said Dylan Morris, a co-author of the study and graduate student at Princeton.  The virus potential for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, meaning the infected individual can be contagious without showing any symptoms, is believed to be the major factor for the rapid outbreak, Gamble said.  This factor makes a big difference for intervention strategies, as SARS-CoV-1 was mostly contained by putting sick people in quarantine, Gamble said. The same method is not viable for SARS-CoV-2 as asymptomatic people can still be infectious, she said.  That's why we are now practicing this social distancing, ... where we ask people, even if they're not showing any symptoms, to try as much as possible to reduce contact with other people, Gamble said. Because potentially, they can be carrying the virus without knowing it.  The data for cardboard suggests that there is a significant discrepancy between the half-lives of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. However, as the cardboard results were the noisiest of the group, meaning there is greater room for error, the researchers concluded that the environmental stability of the two strains is similar.  The results showed that copper had the lowest stability among all the materials tested, which means SARS-CoV-2 doesnt remain on a surface of it for very long. This may be because copper has been shown to have antimicrobial properties, Morris said.  That was part of why we wanted to test copper, Morris said. Because copper has been known for some time to have virucidal properties, that is, viruses ... tend to not stick around very well on copper.  Respiratory viruses like the novel coronavirus are primarily spread by droplet nuclei, which are collections of viral secretions, said Timothy Brewer, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.  These particles are produced when people talk, cough or sneeze and tend to travel anywhere from about one to two meters and then impact on a surface, Brewer added.  (If these particles) impact on a surface, they can survive there for a while, Brewer said. So it is important for individuals to wash their hands after touching surfaces or frequently cleaning surfaces where there may be a lot of potentially infectious individuals.  A key takeaway from the study is the importance of wearing masks to avoid contaminating the environment, Morris said.  If you put on a mask and wear it for a little while, you'll notice that it gets a little bit gross and humid in there. ... Some of that humidity is droplets that didn't get out into the environment, Morris said. If those droplets had the virus, those are viruses that didnt get out to the environment (and) land on the plastic where they could have stuck around for a half-life of about six, eight hours.  The study also showed that the virus can linger in aerosolized form, droplets suspended in the air, for up to three hours after being ejected from the patient.  Aerosolized particles are generated in pretty high numbers ... by some of the medical procedures that you use to treat severe (COVID-19 cases), like ventilation, Morris said. That's a big risk for any doctor or nurse or technician or other health care workers in that room, so you really need them to have proper protective equipment.",['cap-april-peng'],"['news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.covidmaterials.file_.jpg

It feels kind of sad.&#8221;  UCLA students still on campus experienced a quieter Westwood this quarter, after a majority of students left campus because of the  transition  to remote instruction through the end of spring quarter.   At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Chancellor Gene Block expressed the need to reduce the population density on campus at the direction of public health officials to limit the spread of COVID-19 in a statement released March 10. This announcement led many students living on the Hill to return home for spring quarter.  Some students avoided leaving campus for fear of compromising their health or that of others when Los Angeles County first issued  stay-at-home orders .  Adithya Nair, a first-year computer science student, said he avoids going into Westwood Village because of the risk of contracting the virus and since basic necessities and dining halls are available on campus.  &#8220;Once I went (into Westwood), I saw that mostly all shops were closed, and the reason I left is that there were still a lot of people walking around, although wearing masks,&#8221; Nair said.  Buddy Al-Aydi, a second-year English student, noticed that while some restaurants implemented social distancing guidelines and continued to operate on a limited basis, many Asian restaurants temporarily suspended their services entirely. He said he thought some may incorrectly assume that people and businesses of Asian descent pose a greater risk to the community.  The usual abundance of students and local customers was replaced by the high volume of medical professionals because of the proximity of the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Al-Aydi said.  &#8220;The Village is seeing fewer people, most are not college students. However, the traffic remains mostly the same,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As the hospital is near us, there are medical personnel around.&#8221;  Katja May, a North Westwood Neighborhood Council member and Westwood local, said that despite the obvious challenges, Westwood residents are making the most of their situation.  &#8220;Life is going on in this beautiful Westwood bubble,&#8221; May said. &#8220;Many students come in small, socially distant groups to take graduation photos on campus. A joy to see.&#8221;  Despite the ability of Westwood residents to adjust to this new way of life, health concerns are still very much present. As Westwood adjusts to its new normal, students who are at home are dearly missed, May said.  &#8220;Ralphs, Trader Joe's, Target are our lifelines,"" May said. ""Toilet paper is back in stock.

Every step was difficult.  I just kind of wanted to give up, said Lin, a graduate student at UCLA.  His running partner, a friend from his graduate biomathematics program, kept him going, Lin said. His running partner cheered along and kept a positive attitude from start to finish. And when Lin's partner started to feel cramps in his knees, Lin was able to encourage him in turn.  Throughout the race we kind of just talked to each other, like, Hey, we can do this, Lin said.  The LA Marathon took off from Dodger Stadium early this Sunday. Competing Bruins raced through iconic locations like Chinatown and Hollywood, later passing through Westwood and finishing at Santa Monica Beach.  One station at the mile 20 mark, dubbed Rivalry Row, even divided the course between cheering UCLA and USC supporters, forcing runners to pick a side.  A marathon measures 26.2 miles, a distance that can take between two and six hours to complete. LAs marathon takes place annually and sees over 27,000 participants. To race, participants must be 16 or older  there are no other qualifications. Participants who are younger than 16 can participate in the race through  Students Run LA , a non-profit organization that trains at-risk middle and high schools students to run a marathon.  Even other runners are kind of intimidated by the marathon, said Connor Jops, a fourth-year computational and systems biology student who has run the LA Marathon twice before. People need to hold it in respect, I guess.  Training for marathons can take months, and can sometimes demand more than the race itself.  Lin was counted among more than half of the LA Marathon competitors that ran the race as their first marathon.  He started training for long-distance running in 2019 because a friend from his program, who had also never run the marathon before, invited Lin to race with him. The most running Lin usually did before then was 15 minutes on the treadmill, he said.  His training included three faster workouts during the week, an easy run Saturdays, and a two-to-three-hour-long run Sundays.  Lin, who has to work every day on a self-directed project for his graduate program, found that running helped him build discipline.  If you don't really have that discipline ... you'll kind of drift apart and then procrastinate more, he said.  Lin isnt the only student competing in a marathon this year. Several students participated in the LA Marathon, while others are preparing for different marathons, such as the Mountains 2 Beach in May.  Tulsi Patel, a fourth-year psychobiology student, is training for the San Francisco Marathon in July.  Her training schedule varies more, with a baseline three to four runs per week all year-round and a gradual increase in volume beginning around six weeks before a race, she said. Patel also plans to run two half marathons ahead of the full marathon as part of her training.  Balancing running with other responsibilities is a constant struggle, Patel said. She sometimes takes a break from running if she gets too busy.  She wasnt always so forgiving with herself when she had to take those breaks, though, Patel said. Before her first half marathon, Patel said she pushed herself too hard, eventually turning shin splints into a stress fracture.  Nowadays, Patel tries to avoid pressure and guilt. If she doesnt meet her weekly goals, she allows herself to relax and focus on other responsibilities.  For runners, after so much time spent training, race day itself is an entirely different experience.  The morning of a long-distance competition is usually an early one for participants. Runners in the LA Marathon lined up under the tall trees surrounding the stadium, bibs pinned to their shirts, as early as 6:30 a.m. They began in waves, with wheelchair users starting first, then hand-cyclists, then female runners and finally male runners.  Jops first marathon was a testament to his inexperience.  I didn't realize you're supposed to eat food while you run, said Jops. You know, you need to stop for water and stuff. I figured it out, later in the race.  DJs, performers and cultural groups lined the course, and course attendees handed out peeled oranges, Jops said. At one of the marathons, friends from UCLA Bruinrunners cheered him on at the 20-mile mark, near UCLA. The support came at the right time.  It becomes a blur, especially near the end, Jops said. Past mile 18 you start to hit the wall and start to fade out a little bit.  Lin enjoyed the first half of his race, before injury and fatigue made an appearance. The multitudes of cheering spectators were a new experience for him, Lin said.  For Elaine Huang, with her small frame, one of the best parts of racing is passing grown men.  Theyre dying and Im like, See you at the finish line! said Huang, who will begin her first year as a UCLA graduate student this fall.  Everyone has their own reason for running long distances in competition.  For many students, running is a way to escape the stress of academics and other responsibilities.  Many graduate students struggle with depression and other mental health issues, Lin said. He said he would recommend running to anyone, but to graduate students especially.  Youre just focusing on running, your breathing, Lin said. Its kind of like a meditation tool for me.  Patel likes to run in complete solitude. Running also serves as a form of stress relief for her, Patel said.  It allows me to completely detach from the world and social media and humans, she said.  For others, running is a way to make friends and stay connected on a large campus.  Running in general is my social life, Jops said.  Many runners at UCLA practice with Bruinrunners, Jops and Huang included. Huang said it was Bruinrunners that gave her a sense of community in summer of 2019, when she first moved from New Jersey to work in a UCLA lab.  Huang also said she once became running partners with a Japanese international student she met at a bus stop.  One reason not to run, runners say, is for acclaim.  Jops finds it hard to understand why people run the marathon for bragging rights. Anyone can accomplish the feat with commitment and training, he said.  (Running, for me, is) almost like what eating is to other people, Huang said. Just something that helps me get through the day.",['cap-maddie-rausa'],"['california', 'los-angeles', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.lamarathon.JHan_.jpg

Bruin Bucks tackles the confusing parts of personal finance they dont teach you in school.   It's tax season, Bruins, and that means it's time to figure out what on Earth   a 1040 form is.  Learning to file a tax return can be a little like doing your own laundry for the first time. At first, sorting clothes by color, fabric type and care instructions can be overwhelming. Every article of clothing has individual requirements. Similarly, forms like the W-2, 1099 and 1098-T seem like they're designed just to confuse you.  But no need to fear. With The Quad's help, tax returns will become just as easy as doing your laundry. No previous experience required.  First of all, what are tax returns? A tax return is a way of legally documenting your income and expenses. It also helps you determine your tax liability, which is the amount of tax debt owed to the Internal Revenue Service.  The first step in navigating tax return season is determining whether or not you need to file. The key elements in answering this question rely on your age, income and filing status.  For college students, your filing status most likely falls into the categories of single and under the age of 65. If these selections apply to you and your income was more than $12,000 in 2019, you must file a tax return.      However, it's important to remember that even if you made less than $12,000, you should file a tax return if you want to get your withholdings back. However, tax returns are not legally required for those who made under $12,000 last year. For further clarification, the IRS has a  brief quiz  to determine your filing status.  If you are required to file, there are a few forms that are relevant for college students: W-2, 1099, 1040, 1098-T and 1098-E.  Whether you worked full- or part-time, you can expect a W-2 form in the mail from an employer. The IRS requires employers to send you a hard copy of this form by Jan. 31. A W-2 includes details about the amount of money you earned as well as the amount of income tax withheld from your paychecks. Similarly, a 1099 form   is a similar form for income from freelance work, such as driving for Uber or Postmates.  From there, the information on these forms is used to fill out a 1040 tax form to report your earned income to the IRS, thereby determining how much you owe the federal government in taxes. If California is your state of residence, you'll also need to send your annual earnings to the State of California Franchise Tax Board to pay personal income taxes. For those who are tech-savvy, you can receive and file these tax forms completely  online .  Before you file, though, you'll want to find out if you are eligible for tax deductions and credits.  Tax deductions are subtractions from a persons taxable income which lowers their tax liability. Common deductions include philanthropic efforts such as charitable donations or community service.    You can also receive a tax deduction by opening a retirement savings account such as an IRA or Roth IRA. Tax credits are similar to deductions in that they minimize your tax liability. Credits are given if you care for a dependent such as a child or senior, as well as  education-related payments.   Tax deductions and credits should both be included on your 1040 tax form. However,  tax deductions  are itemized, or presented as a list of individual items,   in Schedule A, while  tax credits  are included under Schedule 3.  Now, this is where the 1098-T and 1098-E come into play since the aforementioned educational expenses are often eligible for tax credits. The 1098-T tracks expenses paid to any institution for higher education such as a community college or university and 1098-E records interest payments on student loans. For more information on filling out tuition-related tax paperwork,  TurboTax  has a helpful guide.  After throwing your clothes in the drier, they come out feeling all warm and snuggly: a reward for all your hard work. After completing copious amounts of tax forms, you may also receive a tax refund  that's money back in your pocket.  To receive any sort of refund, you first need to submit your tax return on time. Most federal, state and local tax returns are due April 15 every year unless that date falls on a weekend or national holiday. From there, filers who overpaid on their taxes can expect to get a tax refund from the state government, federal government or both.  Because of the spread of COVID-19, United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin announced the April 15 tax deadline will be extended by 90 days. Originally, California extended its tax return deadline by 60 days but then later also extended it by 90 days.  According to the IRS, most tax refunds are delivered within 21 days of filing. For reference, the  average tax refund last year  was around $3,000   for most people  so every bit counts.  For beginners interested in saving time and money, there is an ample amount of online tax return resources right at your fingertips.  Software services  include TurboTax, H&amp;R Block, TaxAct and Credit Karma.  If you need help with your taxes and   choose to seek assistance from a professional, its important to choose someone you trust. This person will have access to your financial records and highly sensitive information, including your Social Security number.  While filing taxes can be tedious, it's something you'll likely have to do every year if you live in the U.S. and work after graduation.

The five-star recruit out of Las Vegas has broken his commitment to UCLA mens basketball and will instead sign with the NBA G League to pursue a professional career, The Athletic reported Tuesday. Nix was rated as the nations No. 1 point guard in the class of 2020 and was the first prospect coach Mick Cronin earned a commitment from at UCLA.    Nix is the third top-level recruit to spurn the NCAA in favor of the G League this month, joining fellow five-stars Jalen Green and Isaiah Todd.    The new G League model allows high school students to skip college and get paid up to $500,000 for one year in the NBAs developmental league. Nixs contract is expected to pay him roughly $300,000 next season, The Athletics Shams Charania reported.    Nix and the other recruits who took this path will still be eligible to declare for the 2021 NBA Draft.    With Nix gone, the Bruins 2020 recruiting class is made up of four-star shooting guard Jaylen Clark. Small forward Johnny Juzang, a former four-star recruit,   is set to transfer from Kentucky to UCLA and is awaiting the status of his immediate eligibility waiver.    Rising redshirt sophomore guard Tyger Campbell will once again be the lone point guard in Cronins rotation next season. Campbell played at least 33 minutes in each of UCLAs final 10 games this year after missing his entire freshman season with a torn ACL.

With films, video games and even books being flooded with sequels, remakes and spinoffs, audiences in recent years have appeared to embrace familiarity over novelty. In Recent Rewinds, columnist Phillip Leung explores the entertainment industry&#8217;s inclination toward reimagining and building on old stories.    Word on the grapevine is that a new app has taken a byte from the short-video market.  In January, a successor to the decommissioned app Vine arose under a new name &#8211; byte. The app, developed by Vine co-creator Dom Hofmann, allows users to loop six-second videos in a simple and minimalistic platform, appealing to those who cherished Vine's collection of short clips. Competitors such as TikTok and Instagram, however, could mean the market is too saturated for byte to make the same impact as its predecessor.  To start, creating an app with the sole purpose of recreating one that was shut down for being unprofitable is a questionable decision at best. While Vines were widely praised for their six-second limit, which promoted more creative content, their simplicity allowed competitors to mimic Vine&#8217;s features. Soon after Vine took off, competitors such as Instagram and Snapchat incorporated short video formats into their platforms as well, taking away from Vine&#8217;s core appeal. As entertaining as well-crafted short clips can be, they alone are not enough to sustain a business.   [Related:    Recent Rewinds: Live-action &#8216;Mulan&#8217; sacrifices Mushu and music for cultural accuracy, realism   ]   Such content-creator businesses, including YouTube and Instagram, rely heavily on their users to stay afloat &#8211; the more resources platforms have to offer their content creators, the better. For instance, YouTube gradually added live-video streaming and gaming channels to gain a wider audience. Unfortunately, Vine's inherent simplicity did not have such diverse resources to offer, and neither does byte. While Vine produced popular content creators who are still active today, including Liza Koshy and Shawn Mendes, many ultimately left the platform at some point, contributing to its demise in 2017.   Immediately dismissing apps based on short videos, however, would be ignoring the elephant in the room &#8211; TikTok. The app had 500 million monthly active users in 2018, according to its owner ByteDance, with current estimates of around 800 million. TikTok allows users to post videos up to 15 seconds long, often accompanied by music in the background. While TikTok may initially appear to possess similar drawbacks to Vine and byte, a few subtleties have helped propel it to its current success. The app's widespread popularity, especially in the U.S., poses yet another obstacle to byte's breaking into the mainstream.  Fifteen seconds may not seem so different from Vine and byte&#8217;s six seconds, but the slightly less restrictive video limitation gives creators more leeway with their content. Some content creators were very clever in making the most of six seconds, but most popular Vine videos were primarily comedic, such as a young girl mistaking a flock of ducks for chickens.   TikTok, on the other hand, gives slightly more room for content to be tailored to specific communities, including acting, gaming and sports &#8211; all while maintaining its distinction as a platform for short videos. TikTok also takes advantage of the fast turnover and collaborative nature of the internet, providing various video formats for users to react to other videos or film one alongside another. By encouraging users to put their own spin on other people's content, TikTok yields trends that promote community, such as people filming videos of themselves dancing to voicemails from their exes.    [Related:    The Quad: Looking into why TikTok has become so popular, the kind of content it produces   ]   TikTok also incorporates some clever revenue-generating methods taken from other streaming platforms. In addition to ads and sponsorships, TikTok sells an in-app virtual currency that users can give to their favorite creators, similar to how streaming services such as Twitch and YouTube Live allow viewers to donate to streamers. If byte is to truly contend with TikTok, it will need to incorporate such creativity as a business and not just as an app for entertainment.  Thankfully for byte, many were waiting in anticipation   of the app's release. On the weekend it was released, byte was downloaded 780,000 times, a much faster start than Vine. While this is certainly impressive for a brand-new app &#8211; one that was also delayed several times &#8211; TikTok was downloaded 8.2 million times in the same weekend byte was released. Though the gap may seem insurmountable for byte, its fast start shows an audience still exists for a more limited video format.  The odds are certainly against byte, but it should not be written off just yet. Last week, it announced its Partner Program, paving a way for creators to cash in on their videos. The initial pool of $250,000 is quite minuscule compared to TikTok, which made $176.9 million in 2019. Regardless, byte&#8217;s monetization so shortly after launch demonstrates that it&#8217;s serious about making a sustainable business for its users as well as for itself. And with  the U.S. government's security concerns  over TikTok's Chinese ownership, byte might just get the opening it needs.     In the meantime, byte should be given more than six seconds to prove itself.

Some discovered the establishment in its final days, while others had frequented the shop for years.  Aditya Pimplaskar had been visiting Stan&#8217;s Donuts since his freshman year. After hearing it closed down April 9, he said he felt a core part of Westwood Village was lost.  ""It&#8217;s going to suck to see nobody getting doughnuts from that corner, or being able to walk by and smell them,&#8221; said Pimplaskar, a third-year computational and systems biology student. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m going to miss that peanut butter (doughnut) a lot.&#8221;  Stan Berman  permanently closed  his 55-year-old donut establishment amid the coronavirus pandemic and resulting ""safer at home"" orders.  Located in the heart of the Village, just opposite the historic Regency Village Theatre, Stan&#8217;s Donuts was iconic in the area.  Pimplaskar said he went back to Stan&#8217;s Donuts several times during his second and third years to introduce his friends to the shop, just as his friend once introduced him. Stan&#8217;s Donuts was a rooted part of the UCLA student culture, he said.  &#8220;Every college has its student culture and the things students experience,&#8221; Pimplaskar said. &#8220;I think that was the biggest thing for me, knowing that I had frequented the doughnut shop.&#8221;  Joseph Russel, treasurer of the North Westwood Neighborhood Council and a third-year computer science and political science student, said he and many members of the UCLA community were disappointed to hear Stan&#8217;s Donuts had closed.  &#8220;I think that not only do a lot of both undergraduate and graduate students have fond memories of going there with their friends, but I know that a lot of alumni do as well,&#8221; Russel said. &#8220;Many of the alumni and students, both that I talked to as well as faculty, were very disappointed to hear that they had closed.&#8221;  Josh Trifunovic, owner of Rocco&#8217;s Tavern and an alumnus who graduated in 2003, said the aesthetic of Stan&#8217;s Donuts had not changed since he completed his undergraduate education. He felt the consistency made the establishment special.  &#8220;Even as things have changed around (Stan&#8217;s Donuts), it was able to remain in the midst of all this innovation because it had its classic feel to it,&#8221; said Trifunovic, who is also a member of the NWWNC.  During his time at UCLA, students would meet up at Stan&#8217;s Donuts as a starting point for their evening outings, Trifunovic said.  &#8220;(Stan&#8217;s Donuts) was very central, so if you meet at Stan&#8217;s, you could really go anywhere in the Village,&#8221; Trifunovic said. &#8220;Every single route from there went to a different part of the Village.  Paul Miller, who graduated from UCLA in 1989, and his roommate would sometimes go to Stan&#8217;s Donuts at midnight, when the shop, about to close for the day, would sell a dozen doughnuts for $1 or $2.  &#8220;If there was a big premiere movie at the Fox or the Bruin, my roommate and I would get a dozen doughnuts, eat a couple and then pass them out to people in line,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;Everybody would be in a great mood, and it just kind of added to that kind of atmosphere.&#8221;  During Miller&#8217;s time at UCLA, Stan&#8217;s Donuts was a source of comfort food and a place where students might run into alumni who came back to visit.  Paul Kurek, a graduate student in the Department of Germanic Languages, said he believed the establishment was important to student culture because of its local identity and affordable prices.  &#8220;(Stan&#8217;s) was always cheap and ... within your budget, and it was right there in the center (of Westwood Village),&#8221; Kurek said  Stan&#8217;s Donuts was an iconic business not just in Westwood Village, but also in all of Los Angeles, said Andrew Thomas, executive director of the Westwood Village Improvement Association.  Losing Stan&#8217;s Donuts is difficult to fathom, Thomas said.  &#8220;There aren't too many businesses like Stan&#8217;s in Los Angeles, and they are not easily replaced by a long shot,&#8221; Thomas said.  Stan&#8217;s Donuts lasted 55 years in a Los Angeles environment not friendly to small businesses, Thomas said. It constantly competed for customers with other businesses and faced rising costs, such as rent and employee salaries, he added.  &#8220;It's not often appreciated just what our businesses have to do to be successful,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;To (Berman's) credit, he found a way to have a successful business for decades in Los Angeles.&#8221;  Long-time customers said they liked the friendly atmosphere of the small, mom-and-pop doughnut shop.  Pimplaskar said he has always liked visiting small neighborhood stores. He appreciated Stan&#8217;s for its variety of doughnut offerings &#8211; specifically the chocolate peanut butter doughnut.  &#8220;The biggest thing for me was going in there and knowing that it&#8217;s a quick, pretty affordable and very good option for dessert,&#8221; Pimplaskar said.  Kifishia Kawachi&#8217;s restaurant, The Flame Broiler, shared the same space with Stan&#8217;s Donuts for the past seven to eight years. She noticed Berman cared deeply about his employees and customers.  &#8220;There would always be people that come in and they would talk and it (had) a very neighborhood feel when he was around,&#8221; Kawachi said. &#8220;It was a very nice little local place where people would just come by and hang out.&#8221;  Kurek didn&#8217;t begin visiting Stan&#8217;s Donuts until recently, although he knew about the store because he frequents The Flame Broiler. He started purchasing food there recently as a show of support.  &#8220;Those little businesses that are cheap and well-priced, they are really important,&#8221; Kurek said. &#8220;Unfortunately now they're all collapsing because they are not part of a big corporate structure, so they don't have the same financial support network and they fade away, right now when we actually need them the most.&#8221;  When a business closes down in Westwood, Thomas normally receives one or two comments from the public about the closure. When Stan&#8217;s Donuts closed, Thomas said he heard from more people than after every other closed business combined.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard from multiple property owners who are saying if (Berman) wants to give it a go, there are other locations he could move to not just in Westwood but other places in Los Angeles too,&#8221; Thomas said.  Kawachi said in light of losing  Sepi&#8217;s  and Stan&#8217;s Donuts, she hoped to see the legacies of older Westwood restaurants preserved to maintain the neighborhood&#8217;s identity.  Thomas said the business landscape is always changing, and he hopes another business will be able to come to Westwood Village and stay for a long time like Stan&#8217;s Donuts did.  &#8220;We hate to lose Stan&#8217;s; I wish he could stay for another 50-plus years, but he's not,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;I hope that we can have other businesses that hang on for 50 years.&#8221; ",['cap-maanas-oruganti'],"['news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.stansdonutsreactions.JHan_.jpg

The UCLA football players who would have had their pro day back in March were instead stuck inside, forced to prepare for the virtual 2020 NFL Draft remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic. While cornerback Darnay Holmes, running back Joshua Kelley, tight end Devin Asiasi and kicker JJ Molson all had the chance to show off their skills at the NFL Scouting Combine in late February, not all of their teammates had that same opportunity.  Linebacker Krys Barnes was working out in Florida in early March and had just returned to Los Angeles for UCLA's pro day when Mayor Eric Garcetti implemented the ""safer at home"" order.  ""It definitely sucks because you train so long for those three months,"" Barnes said. ""For me  not being a combine guy  and a couple of my other teammates, we're really relying on that pro day. It's one of our last shots to put up some numbers and show some good things in front of scouts.""  Barnes and his agent, Brian Hannula, arranged a plan to record the linebacker's 40-yard dash and other workouts from his family's home in Bakersfield, California, and send them to interested scouts and coaches around the league.  In the meantime, Barnes has managed to stay in shape by practicing drops and coverage skills with his high school teammate, childhood friend and potential first round pick, Utah State quarterback Jordan Love.  ""Just to be able to work out with (Love) and feed off each other has been good for both of us,"" Barnes said. ""Any time we come back to town, we pick up right where we left off from the last time we've seen each other. It's all love there.""  Kelley hasn't returned home like Barnes and some of his other teammates have, and he said he is struggling to find a steady place to work out around Westwood.  ""I've just been trying to find places to go, whether that's an open park or open field,"" Kelley said. ""It's been tough to do that, but you've got to find a way to continue to do it.""  While Barnes and others have had the benefit of returning home for home-cooked meals, Kelley has been left to fend for himself in quarantine.  Kelley said he used to eat nearly all his meals at the Wasserman Football Center  which is currently closed  so he has now resorted to cooking on his own. Although he said he wants to start copying some of the recipes he remembers from Wasserman, he isn't at that level just yet.  ""I'm not ready yet, I'm not ready to expand,"" Kelley said. ""We've got to take baby steps. Then once we get there, I can start doing some stuff.""  The running back posted back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons with UCLA, which was enough production to earn him an invite to the combine, which took place from Feb. 27 to March 1. Kelley's 4.49 second 40-yard dash and 23 bench press reps ranked seventh and fifth among participating running backs, respectively, and he is projected to be picked anywhere between the third and fifth rounds.  Whether or not they made an appearance at the combine, coach Chip Kelly said this is a highly unstable time for every Bruin trying to take the next step. He did, however, compliment his former players for buying into the team's mentality over the past few seasons and applying it to the situation at hand.  ""There's a great unknown for all of them right now,"" Kelly said. ""But when we go back to the mindset of 'control the controllables' and 'take it one day at a time' and all the kind of things that people say are cliche, I think you may really want to look really at those because they make sense, especially in this situation.""  The first Bruin to hear his name called over the weekend is projected to be Holmes, who graduated in three years and participated alongside Kelley at both the combine and Reese's Senior Bowl. Holmes is CBS Sports' No. 16 cornerback available and is slotted to be a third or fourth round pick.  Kelly said NFL teams have talked to him about using Holmes as a nickel back at the next level, despite the fact he played primarily outside the numbers at UCLA. But the coach also said the potential role change and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus hasn't kept Holmes down.  ""(Holmes) is an old soul,"" Kelly said. ""He's got a great approach to life. He's excited every day, he always starts off 'Great day, coach' in a text and has a question for me.""  Holmes was a five-star recruit coming out of high school, and Kelly said the defensive back had always planned to head for the NFL as soon as he could.  The rest of the Bruins with their eyes on the pros have not been fast-tracked to the NFL in the same way.  Linebacker Josh Woods missed the entire 2018 season with a knee injury, edge rusher Keisean Lucier-South picked up a nonmedical redshirt his freshman year and center Boss Tagaloa started his UCLA career on the defensive side of the ball. Asiasi and defensive end Jason Harris were both transfers, as was Kelley.  Kelley was a walk-on at UC Davis before joining UCLA in 2017, and he said holding onto his underdog mindset through the draft process is paramount to his success at the next level.  ""(The walk-on mentality) has definitely become a part of me,"" Kelley said. ""Being a the rookie in the NFL is really nothing to brag about. Those veterans are All-Pros, Super Bowl champions  I haven't done any of that stuff yet. So I've got to establish myself first.""  Regardless of their workout regimens, diets, draft stock or living arrangements, a handful of Bruins will officially make the jump to the pros over the weekend.  When asked about the possibility of facing off against his former teammates on Sundays, Barnes said it's something they've long dreamed about.  ""That would be a blessing to see anybody that we competed with for the last four years and be able to compete against them,"" Barnes said. ""For us, it wouldn't be weird, it'd be a proud moment.""",['cap-sam-connon'],"['football', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/TS19223_1.jpg

We were supposed to be celebrating but we had to close on that very same day that I opened 20 years ago, Sungkamee said. It was like 50% of my revenue was gone. Now, even though we are doing well with the delivery and takeout, its just enough to get by.  Small businesses throughout Westwood and the rest of Los Angeles are struggling because of reduced patronage during the coronavirus pandemic.  Los Angeles Mayor  Eric Garcetti  initially ordered the closure of bars, dine-in restaurants and nightclubs across the city March 15. California Gov.  Gavin Newsom  issued a safer-at-home order statewide shortly after, on March 19, in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. On April 10, these orders were extended until May 15 in Los Angeles County.  Since the start of the safer-at-home orders, businesses have either closed their doors or adapted to takeout, delivery, and curbside pickup.  Roccos Tavern and Barneys Beanery in Westwood Village have temporarily closed until the order is lifted. Some businesses, such as Sur La Table, have not only shut down but have boarded up their storefronts.  With the recent closure of  Stans Donuts , which has been a staple in Westwood for 55 years, concern for small businesses is especially high.  Watching the news, Sungkamee saw that COVID-19 was not only affecting his business but the entire community.  I really feel inspired that the COVID-19 first responders are working so hard, Sungkamee said. They work double shifts, most of them work more than 60 or 70 hours a week. These people are my customers.  In response, Sungkamee created the program  Feed the Heroes  where people can donate meals to UCLA hospital workers to be personally delivered by him. The program has already donated more than 400 meals since its launch earlier this month and garnered support from celebrities like Jennifer Love Hewitt.  The responses that I get from the nurses and the doctors is wonderful. This is the thing that gives them strength, Sungkamee said. Its a small thing, but its making an impact. Not only do we give back to the community but I also feel like my business is staying afloat. I want to fight this with them.  Freddy Papen, a third-generation co-owner of his familys ice cream business, Saffron &amp; Rose, said his business is also struggling during the pandemic. During these uncertain times, he is trying to do his best for both his employees and his business, he added.  Rather than fire his workers, Papen said he spoke to them individually and allowed them to opt out of work for their safety.  Everyone was given the opportunity to stay at home, not come to work, but have the job security to know that when they come back, that their position with our company is still safe, Papen said, But thats difficult  to try to run a business when half of your staff has basically disappeared.  Papen said his business was somewhat prepared for difficult situations but never expected a problem as bad as this.  For a business like ice cream, a lot of our sales are dictated by the weather, Papen said. If it's a hot day, we know that we're going to have a good amount of sales. If it's a rainy day, we know that we are probably going to have a fraction of our normal sales so basically, as a business, we literally put money aside for a rainy day.  Although Saffron &amp; Rose has been cautiously saving for the unexpected, the business is still only scraping by during the pandemic.  Right now we're making just enough to pay our bills, pay our rent, pay our employees and get through, Papen said. The company itself isn't making any money, but we are able to pay our overhead to make sure the doors stay open.  Despite the challenges, Papen is still hopeful Saffron &amp; Rose will survive.  Business is very unexpected. Everything can change from one day to the next, but as long as were staying true to what we do and keeping our product good well be OK, he said.   Headlines , a diner and grill that relocated within the Village in July, has also remained open for takeout and delivery amid widespread business closures.  Erick Mendez, a Headlines co-owner, has worked at his diner for more than 10 years. He said he is worried for the diner and other local businesses.  Those things (COVID-19), they just kill the business, Mendez said. We are just trying to do our best to pay the rent and we have not even made that.  Though the situation is tenuous, Mendez said he still felt supported by his community and the people still coming into the diner.  We get people from the hospital or people working around the Wilshire area, Mendez said. Some customers will just come to support us and buy something from the restaurant.  The move to  online  classes at UCLA prompted many students to leave the Village. Some of those who have remained are witnessing the toll the stay-at-home order is having on small businesses and choose to support them by occasionally ordering takeout.  Jemma Tan, a fourth-year English and political science student, chose to reside in her Westwood apartment. The current situation isnt the first time  small businesses  have seemed to struggle, she said.  In Westwood the rental cost is so high already that even without all of this, its hard for small businesses to sustain themselves, Tan said. We have had so many little pop-ups come and go.  Small businesses such as  Sepis , which closed down in 2019, struggled to remain in the Village long before COVID-19 limited their business amid all the coronavirus-related closures.  Isabella Bustanoby, a second-year fine arts and physics student, also chose to remain in her university apartment. She added that she has been ordering more takeout in the past few weeks than she normally would.  It is important to support the businesses in your local area, especially for student stores and nonchain operations because they are the most at risk for losing a lot of business, Bustanoby said.  Growing up in Los Angeles, Bustanoby has seen many of her favorite businesses struggle to get by. She said she laments the ripple effects the current economic conditions will have on the community.  For Mendez, the reduced amount of business has not been enough to support the restaurant.  If this thing continues, maybe business will go out, and I have no idea what I would do, Mendez said. Its not only me that would lose my job. Ive never seen anything like whats happening right now.   Contributing reports from Maanas Oruganti,Daily Bruin staff.

This comes in response to the firing of 82 graduate students who went on a wildcat strike for higher wages at UC Santa Cruz in December.  The UCSC teaching assistants have withheld grades since last fall and will continue to do so until their demand for a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, of $1,412 a month is met. The strikers had anticipated the firings as UCSC Interim Campus Provost Lori Kletzer stated her intent to retaliate if undergraduate grades were not submitted by Feb. 21.  Graduate students at UC Santa Barbara voted for a full teaching strike and UC Davis graduate students voted for a grading strike. UC Berkeley graduate students announced they will strike Thursday. Graduate students at other UCs are expected to make public their decisions on if they will strike.  During an open meeting at the steps of Fowler Hall, UCLA graduate students decided to call for the Thursday strike. Some graduate students expressed their worries about losing their jobs. These worries were addressed by speakers who noted that the very nature of a wildcat strike is different from that of a union strike as a wildcat strike is a small group of people powerfully withholding their labor to make a statement. They emphasized that the presence of a strike will organically grow the momentum around it.  The graduate student strikes are not endorsed by the union representing over 19,000 Academic Student Employees in the University of California system, United Auto Workers Local 2865, as the current union contract has a no-strike clause.  Despite this, the union is working toward a sanctioned unfair labor practice strike that needs membership authorization. In the meantime, the union and the UC administration have each filed unfair labor practice charges against the other through the California Public Employment Relations Board over their responses to the UCSC wildcat strike.  All day Thursday, strikers will form a picket line at Janss Steps where there will be a rally at noon. The strike entails graduate students and faculty canceling their classes, office hours and meetings or to plan on holding them at the picket line. Undergraduates are asked to show their solidarity through a walk-out of their classes. A campuswide email sent by Ucla4Cola on Monday night clarified that the point of the strike is to send a message to the UCLA administration. They reiterated their demands for an immediate COLA, the reinstatement of the fired UCSC strikers and the elimination of on-campus police.  Graduate students from across the UC system held rallies in support of the wildcat strikers over the past two weeks and have echoed demands for higher wages at their respective campuses. Last week UCLA graduate students organized a Student Solidarity Week.  Last Monday, graduate students distributed a petition for undergraduates called &#8220;We Want TAs to Withhold Our Grades.&#8221; So far, nearly 500 have signed onto it. The petition clarified that since the start of the strike last fall, TAs still graded the undergraduate students&#8217; work and, on a case-by-case basis, submitted the grades of students who requested it with no questions asked.  The petition goes on to express frustration with the shared condition of food and housing insecurity faced by graduate and undergraduate students and how undergraduates are discouraged from enrolling in graduate school because of insufficient wages.  To highlight the issue of food insecurity on campus, students held a COLA meeting in Covel Commons Residential Restaurant last Tuesday. Students who joined the meeting were asked not to swipe in as a form of civil disobedience. UCLA administrators congregated at the entrance of the dining hall and the food stands to observe the students.  UCLA administrators threatened to take disciplinary measures against those who participated. UCPD sent five police cars and a motorcycle to the event. In addition, plainclothes individuals who refused to identify themselves were seen taking video of the students and then followed them as they exited the venue.  Students took to Twitter and Instagram to express their frustration that they were harassed in plain view of an overwhelming police presence and the administration.  Last Wednesday, undergraduate students were asked to bring their class-related work to Janss Steps as a show of the largely unrecognized labor of graduate students.   During the event, TAs graded exams, held office hours and invited their classes to the steps. The day after, graduate students hosted a forum to discuss the overlap between increased policing in the U.S. and the defunding of public education.   They focused on the plight of U.S. political prisoners, antiblackness, racism and their connection to the ongoing housing crisis. At UC Irvine, Shikera Chamday, a black UCI alumna, was arrested by UCIPD as she attempted to get her transcripts during a COLA rally on campus that she was not participating in. UCI Black Student Union and United Students Against Sweatshops issued a  petition  in support of Chamday stating, &#8220;The police operating on UCI&#8217;s campus problematizes the notion that the university is, in fact, a safe space to learn, think, and grow for Black students.&#8221;  A growing number of support letters have been issued from across the UC system and the U.S., including from various departments, faculty associations, student groups, unions and universities.  UCLA graduate students continue to grow the movement along with their peers across the UC system.    Graduate students across the UC are striking as part of their demand for a cost-of-living adjustment. The author of this op-ed is a member of Ucla4Cola and has requested anonymity because of fear of retaliation from the university.

Disruptions stemming from the outbreak have forced some students to face racial harassment in online classes, financial hardship and other challenges. In response, the UCLA administration and the Academic Senate have encouraged teachers to use secure access codes, created financial support programs and announced grading changes. However, UCLAs response to these issues did not gather sufficient student input, said some undergraduate and graduate student leaders.  Undergraduate Students Association Council President Robert Watson has been meeting with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Monroe Gorden Jr. to discuss student matters. Additionally, Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck will meet with Graduate Students Association President Zak Fisher later this quarter.  USAC is the student-elected governing body for undergraduate students that controls about $9 million in student fees each year. GSA is the graduate student elected government, which represents nearly 13,000 UCLA graduate students. It also controls about $1 million, Fisher said.  Despite his meetings with administrators, Watson, a fourth-year political science student, said he thinks the administration as a whole has not sufficiently involved students in its decision-making.  USACs ability to communicate with the chancellor is significantly less than other student governments access to their universities chancellors and presidents, Watson said. Chancellor Gene Block usually schedules one 30-minute meeting with the USAC president per quarter. However, Block has scheduled one additional meeting with Watson this quarter.  When you only have one (quarterly) meeting with the chancellor, something (might come) up after that meeting, Watson said. If ... something bad happens after that, its difficult to communicate with (Chancellor Block) except for over email, and even over email, its still sometimes difficult.   Addressing academic issues   In line with increased communication, Dean of Students Maria Blandizzi has been regularly communicating with USAC by attending weekly council meetings and regularly corresponding over email, said Academic Affairs Commissioner Naomi Riley. Blandizzi is actively working with the council after several  Zoombomings  in which classes held on the video conference application Zoom, including Astronomy 3: Nature of Universe and Chicano 143: Mestizaje: History of Diverse Racial/Cultural Roots of Mexico, were interrupted with vulgar messages, Riley said.  The university is responsible for addressing the racial harassment incidents, said Fisher, a law student. The university, as an employer, has a legal obligation to create a safe work environment, Fisher added.  Students, ... students of color, Jewish students (and) students from marginalized backgrounds, can be exposed to that kind of vitriol just for going to class, Fisher said. Not to mention the professors and the graduate students and the lecturers, that they can be exposed to that kind of vitriol. Thats not safe.  Fisher said he thinks that UCLA has not made a sufficient effort in gathering graduate student input before making major decisions, such as the move to online learning.  While the administrations communication with USAC has improved, collaboration with the UCLA Academic Senate has not, Watson said. USAC appoints about 25 student representatives to the Academic Senate, which is responsible for overseeing academic matters such as degree requirements.  The Academic Senate Legislative Assembly  voted  March 11 in an executive session meeting to suspend winter quarter final exam restrictions. Student representatives were not allowed to attend the March 11 meeting because it was an executive session, Riley said.  The Academic Senate Undergraduate Council, known as the UgC, voted March 20 to change spring quarter grading policies, Riley said. Student representatives appointed by USAC were present at the meeting and allowed to vote.  Watson asked Academic Senate Chair Michael Meranze on March 23 to postpone the UgCs announcement on spring quarter grading. USAC published its  recommendation  on the matter the next day, however, the UgC had already made its decision for spring grades, Watson said.  After receiving USACs letter, the Academic Senate leadership discussed its recommendations, Meranze said in an emailed statement. The Academic Senate leadership includes Meranze, Vice Chair Shane White and Immediate Past Chair Joseph Bristow.  In light of that conversation, Senate Leadership met to discuss the USAC concerns and requests and although we did not agree with their position we did discuss and consider it thoroughly, Meranze said in the statement.  However, the UgC, which makes policy for undergraduate education, did not discuss the USAC recommendations, said Riley, who sits on the UgC.  Later that week on March 26, the Academic Senate  announced  that students may take multiple Pass/No Pass classes, but did not implement USACs recommendation for universal Pass/No Record grading.  The Academic Senate accepted essentially none of USACs recommendations, Riley said. Since departments arent required to accept Pass/No Pass grading for major requirements, students taking all major classes do not benefit, Riley added.  The more that we have demanded and the more that weve shown that students are being severely affected, the more that theyve listened, Riley said.   Allocating resources   Several UCLA administrative offices are working to provide resources for students in financial hardship.  Blandizzis office, the UCLA Economic Crisis Response Team, UCLA Financial Aid and Scholarships, UCLA Campus Human Resources and UCLA Case Management Services are using data collected from a form sent to students to provide need-based resources, said Blandizzi in an emailed statement.  The UCLA Division of Undergraduate Education and UCLA Financial Aid and Scholarships formed the Bruin Tech Fund Grant, providing up to $1,000 for undergraduate students to purchase technology needed for online learning. However, graduate students are ineligible and the deadline to apply was April 1, according to the grants information  sheet .  Many (graduate students) are saying, I am a TA (and) I dont have internet access, or I dont have a computer (and) I dont have the tools to do my job, Fisher said.  UCLA administration created the grant after being told by undergraduate students that the lack of reliable internet connection or computers was preventing them from going home to study, said Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education Pat Turner in an emailed statement.  Watson said he thinks that although the administration has been communicating with his office, USAC was not part of a collaborative effort to create the grant.  In addition to the grant, students can borrow laptops for spring quarter from Campus Library Instructional Computing Commons, Turner said in the statement. While the CLICC computer lab is closed, the CLICC laptop lending service is continuing to receive requests  online . The library is considering alternative ways to distribute laptops to students, said UCLA spokesperson Melissa Abraham in an emailed statement.  Graduate students are especially impacted by the economic impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, Fisher said. Graduate students have been  calling  on the University of California and UCLA for a cost-of-living adjustment for several months because of low stipends relative to the high cost of living.  Following the coronavirus outbreak, Fisher said his office is planning to direct funds budgeted for on-campus programming to the GSA Hardship Fund. UCLA should also be making cash payments to students to help relieve financial hardships, Fisher added.  I think it's important that we remember that (administrators) still hold public positions, they're still accountable to the public, they're still accountable to the students and the faculty and everyone else, Fisher said. Maybe (now) more than ever is a time to collectively raise our voices and demand serious change.",['cap-justin-jung'],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.studentinput.file_.jpg

This week's big events include Super Tuesday, graduate student strikes and a declaration of a state of emergency.            UCLA graduate student  s vote to strike for COLA, pending approval from 10 departments      In response to 54 UC Santa Cruz graduate students being fired for withholding grades, the Ucla4Cola organization voted to strike for one day and rallied Thursday.   UCSC graduate students began striking in December for a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, in an effort to raise their wages. Beginning Feb. 10, graduate students refused to grade or perform other job duties.   UCSC offered a $2,500 retroactive housing supplement to Master of Fine Arts and doctoral students if they resumed their job duties in an effort to resolve the issue.  Fifty-four graduate students continued to withhold grades and were consequently fired by the University of California Office of the President.   In a recent development, pending approval from graduate students from at least 10 departments approve, almost 100 graduate students voted to go on strike starting next week.   Striking workers said the strike will be nonunion-sanctioned, or a wildcat strike, and will last until the graduate students receive affordable housing and higher wages. The graduate students plan on not teaching or grading for the duration of the strike.   Currently, no department has released an official statement of support.    Wait times at polling centers at Ackerman Union run more than 4 hours    Fourteen states, including California, voted in primaries on Super Tuesday, drawing students to several polling sites across campus, including Ackerman Union &#8211; where the wait time for some was nearly four hours.   According to several poll workers, other voting centers near campus, including Hammer Museum and Warner Avenue Elementary School had hourslong lines at points during the day as well.  Lines were still hourslong when polls closed at 8 p.m.  Joshua Avila, co-director at BruinsVOTE! and a third-year political science student, said the voting machines in Ackerman failed early on in the day prompting the use of provisional ballots,   but were up and running later that day. Warner Avenue Elementary School had similar technical difficulties.    Program lowers BruinCard replacement fee by $15 with waiver     A new student government program has reduced the cost to replace lost or stolen BruinCards by $15.  BruinCards, which normally   cost $25, can be replaced for $10 for students who fill out a Google form requesting the fee waiver starting March 2. The reduced cost replacement waiver will be provided on a first-come, first-serve basis.  The waiver can be found on the Undergraduate Students Association Council Financial Supports Commission&#8217;s website and social media or at the BruinCard Center.  USAC&#8217;s surplus allocations gave the Financial Supports office $2,000 for the program up until June 1, or when all fee waivers are exhausted.    Three students being tested for COVID-19 amid increased university precaution        Thirteen COVID-19 cases lead the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to declare a public health emergency in LA County.   On Wednesday morning, there were six new cases, bringing the total to seven. But only one case is hospitalized while the others are in home isolation, said Barbara Ferrer, the director of the LACDPH. Four new cases were announced Thursday, increasing the count to 11, with two more being confirmed on Friday for a total of 13.  At a conference, Kathryn Barger, the supervisor of the 5th District, said the state of emergency was declared   in order to increase preparedness and response capabilities. Barger said it also allows the county to seek help from state and federal partners.   Chancellor Gene Block emailed the UCLA community early Friday morning, stating that there are currently three UCLA students being tested for COVID-19 by the LACDPH. The students are self-isolating off campus. The email also stated that there are no current positive tests for COVID-19 on the UCLA campus and that classes are operating normally, but that they are monitoring the situation.

Project Students for Progress in Employee Language Learning, which partners students with workers to help them improve their English skills, depended on funds from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor and other departments to keep the program running, said Alexa Montes De Oca, the 2019-2020 materials and training director and 2020-2021 president of Project SPELL and a third-year psychobiology student. On Monday, program director Stephanie Youngblood said her direct supervisor told her they would not renew the programs funding, which required about $100,000 annually, according to an email statement from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor.  According to the University of California Employee Pay  report , Youngbloods position required a little over $50,000 in 2018.&nbsp;  With no funds to continue the project, the program will end June 30, said Youngblood, who is also an English as a second language specialist. Youngblood will also be unemployed as of June 30, the last day the University of California committed to not  laying off its employees  for COVID-19-related reasons.  Project SPELL pairs undergraduate and graduate students with workers from three UCLA departments  Facilities Management, Housing &amp; Hospitality Services and UCLA Health  to help employees improve their English speaking and writing skills.  There are about 200 employees and student tutors in the program, Youngblood said.  Students have led several efforts to revive the program, including petitioning the UCLA administration and the Undergraduate Students Association Council external vice president for funds, Montes De Oca said.  The petition had close to 5,000 signatures as of June 10.  Students and employees involved in the project are also encouraged to send letters asking UCLA administration to restore the projects funds and be vocal on social media, Montes De Oca said.  Montes De Oca said the program also helps employees overcome obstacles in their workplace and personal life, such as navigating their workplace and acquiring their citizenship.  Youngblood is the only program director in the project.  Most of the funds went to Youngbloods salary and the rest paid for other program costs, such as learning materials, Montes De Oca said.  Essentially, if we don't have a director, we do need to shut down, she said.  Montes De Oca said Youngbloods expertise as an ESL specialist is central for the program. Youngblood coordinates communication between the departments they work with, matches students with employees, evaluates workers learning progress, helps develop lesson plans and more, she said.  Sara Kashani, a tutor for Project SPELL, said she received a performative response when she asked Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck to revive the program.  Theyre like Oh, we really care about fostering your growth.' ... When it comes down to it, theyre not walking their talk, she said.  In an email acquired by The Bruin, Becks office told Kashani that the office did not disagree with the benefits the project provided to student volunteers and a limited group of front-line workers, but difficult cost-cutting decisions need to be made.  Elizabeth Filiano, a former participant of the project and senior custodian, said she cried last week when she heard that Project SPELL was shutting down.  Many of her colleagues who are not native English speakers struggle speaking to their managers and have difficulty understanding their jobs, she said. The programs defunding saddens her because it is a lost opportunity for colleagues whose first language is not English, she added.  Prior to joining the project in 2014, Filiano said she was not confident in her English and her work position remained stagnant. Through Project SPELL, Filiano gained confidence in her English and started talking to students and her manager. She added that she applied for a supervising position in housekeeping this year, although the position was later suspended because of the pandemic.  Filiano said she left the program this year because of schedule conflicts, but she continues to call Youngblood and the people at the project family. Some tutors even greet Filiano at her workplace, she added.  (Youngblood) didnt treat us like another worker, she didnt treat us like another number at the university, she (treats) us like family, Filiano said. Its no more its like a program, you became a family in the program.    Montes De Oca began volunteering for the program because she saw her roots as a first-generation Hispanic student represented in the project. Since she joined the program as a second-year, the project has become a reminder of where she came from, she said.  Youngblood said 80%-90% of students from the project are first-generation and are typically people of color with immigrant backgrounds.  Montes De Oca said if the project fails to receive restoration of their funds from the administration, they will look for alternative modes of funding to provide Youngbloods salary, such as the Volunteer Center. If that fails, she and the projects leaders would look into feasible ways to restructure the program, Montes De Oca added.  Youngblood said if there is an opportunity to come back to the project, she would.  Its my home, she said.  Youngblood said she has been proud to foster a community for first-generation, working-class, immigrant students and employees of color over the past six years. Though there is a small number of learners in the program, she said there is something special about the project that can not be quantified.  The contributions the program has made to campus, has made to individual peoples lives ... is something Im very, very proud of and I think its a loss for the university, she said.",['cap-kari-lau'],"['a-closer-look', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/webnewsprojectspellpetitionfile.jpg

Following the spread of COVID-19 and news that the annual event would not be able to go on in Pauley Pavilion as planned, executive director and fourth-year dance student Jess Grimes said her committee needed to find a way for it to take on a new life. The most logical option was to shift student performances to be completely prerecorded, Grimes said. By working closely with the musicians and other student artists to put together the videos, she said Spring Sing 2020 will create a shared experience for UCLA students scattered across the globe when it launches May 29.  We've seen ('Saturday Night Live') and all these other late night TV shows really working with this new format, and the whole world adapting to it, Grimes said. So we're really trying to follow that same line, and just be able to create this content ... and let the student artists take autonomy with that.  The new online format will consist of prerecorded performances from artists selected before the live performance had to be canceled, she said. While the artists are still putting together their videos, Grimes said they all have unlimited avenues for however they want to creatively showcase their songs. Once each video is edited, they will likely be uploaded in staggered intervals to mimic the order of what the live performance would have looked like, she said.   [Related:    Dance Marathon 2020 moves online with a focus on themes of unity and awareness   ]     The comments section on the uploaded videos will also foster a sense of interaction that normally exists between students who would be sitting and watching together, Grimes said. Continuing the performance on a similar scale allows not only for the musicians to have a platform to share their talents, but also for those away from UCLA to feel connected again.  With the transfer to video, the Spring Sing committee also had to consider artists who may not have the resources to showcase their songs. Emily Kohl, a third-year human biology and society student and the events talent director, said she is working closely with each artist to ensure they have all the equipment necessary to bring their creative visions to life.  Between interspersed Zoom meeting check-ins, Kohl said she works with UCLA artists and with visual and sound editors so each musician can have the   means to make a video to match their vision. Whether it is animation, audio editing or polishing for post-production, she said the new circumstances have provided an opportunity for student artists who produce music in all genres to virtually collaborate.  Everyone is in a different space mentally (and) physically right now, Kohl said. And with (collaboration) comes accessibility to certain resources that they have. So these videos, they are really anything that they want to make.  Since varied circumstances   create an uneven playing field among performers, Grimes said this years Spring Sing will eliminate its celebrity judges and almost all of its usual awards. Only the George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement and the Bruin Choice Award  given to a celebrity doing good in the community and students favorite act, respectively  will be awarded. While the committee is still finalizing how voting for the Bruin Choice Award will occur, it will likely follow a text-to-vote format after every video is uploaded, with the winner being announced the following day, she said.   [Related:    UCLA musicians maximize newfound time by pursuing new projects, art forms   ]   In place of the celebrity judges, Grimes said Spring Sing has been working to set up Zoom meetings between each artist and a famous musician for mentorship opportunities. This sense of unison between artists is one of the most beneficial aspects of switching to an online platform, said Alena Abella, a fourth-year financial actuarial mathematics student who is performing this year as a part of the duo Social Art Project.  She said she and Matthew Gilbert, a fourth-year musicology student and the other half of the duo, have been   working to create a real social art project to display their song. The last lyric of the song is Can I still love you from so far away? and Gilbert said Social Art Project is trying to provide an answer to that question.  He said they will have students send in reminiscent videos and photos from their days at UCLA before spring quarters transition to online courses. If everyone can come together in their video, he said their audience will see other peoples experiences moving from UCLA to quarantine and be able to relate them to their own.  (Our song) has kind of taken on a new meaning, Gilbert said. (The theme is now) almost like being so far away from campus even and being so far away from our previous life.  Despite taking on a new format, Spring Sings same goal remains rooted in its core, Grimes said.

HathiTrust is an association of academic and research libraries that preserves materials in a digital library.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, HathiTrust has provided member universities, including UCLA, with temporary online reading access to materials that currently cannot be accessed in person. Students and faculty will have access to these resources as long as the libraries are closed.  &#8220;We intend to expand fair use access to our corpus to ensure that the academic communities of our members can continue teaching and learning with HathiTrust resources if physical access to print collections is compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; said HathiTrust executive director Mike Furlough in a statement posted online.  Through HathiTrust, millions of printed books in the University of California libraries are temporarily available in digital form to any students, faculty or staff who need to access them, said Alison Scott, associate university librarian for collection management and scholarly communication at UCLA.  To access the digitized materials, UCLA students and faculty can log in to the HathiTrust Digital Library website and enter their campus information.  Many professors have had to rely on HathiTrust or other methods to find digital copies of texts or have had to alter their syllabus to favor newer texts.  By making digital materials accessible or adjusting text requirements so students do not have to buy books, UCLA can help to ease students&#8217; stress, especially since many research fellowship grants will not be providing funding, said associate history professor Robin Derby.  &#8220;It&#8217;s been a challenge (to find ways to accommodate students&#8217; new financial difficulties), but the library has partnered with different institutions to provide more e-book access and the resources they have made available helped solve a lot of my problems,&#8221; Derby said.  UCLA students and faculty also have expanded access to collections of several other large online research databases, including the National Emergency Library, ProQuest and EBSCO, while the pandemic is ongoing.  In addition to working with HathiTrust, UCLA Library staff is also pulling other resources together to figure out ways to help students and faculty access research during the pandemic, said Katherine Kapsidelis, a research and instruction librarian.  Kapsidelis and Matthew Vest, a music inquiry and research librarian at UCLA, collaborated on a library  guide  to temporary online resources students and faculty can access during the pandemic.  &#8220;UCLA was well prepared to provide this information online,&#8221; Vest said. &#8220;We have done a lot of work in subscription materials and support of open access initiatives, as well as online workshops and moving research consultations online.&#8221;  OpenUCLA, a current UCLA Library initiative, also intends to support online availability of research articles by launching a new website to offer students and faculty direct access to some digital collections and programs developed by UCLA Library. It will be available within the next few weeks, Scott said.  OpenUCLA was developed by UCLA Library as a new interface for research communication by making UCLA&#8217;s research and digital collections globally accessible and affordable for students and faculty.  &#8220;We really want to do everything that we can to help students and instructors access and use those resources because we're hoping that it's one less source of stress for everybody in this otherwise very difficult moment,&#8221; Kapsidelis said.

Floyd died in police custody after a now-former Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck for close to nine minutes as three other former Minneapolis police officers watched. One of the former police officers is now charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, while the other three are charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and are on bail for $1 million.  Demonstrators from all over Los Angeles County joined the nationwide Black Lives Matter movement this weekend.   [Related link:    Protests erupt in Los Angeles in response to death of George Floyd]    In wake of police brutality, protests and government intervention, the UCLA community  including students, professors and administration  have responded.  Various student leadership groups voiced their support for the black community and protests.  The Afrikan Student Union at UCLA released two separate statements of solidarity that highlighted the current state of the country and the recent situation with UCPD, and calls for UCLA administrators to get UCLA professors to cancel or postpone finals.  Imani Symone Roberson, an ASU board member and historian, said the ASU board drafted the two statements for days, before releasing them to the UCLA community.  This is not a conducive time for our mental health to be studying and worrying about finals. They need to realize that we are fighting for our basic rights as human beings, not as black people, said Roberson, a fourth-year political science student. We had over 10,000 signatures so far to adjust these finals and we just released it 48 hours ago.  The 2020-2021 Undergraduate Students Association Council released a statement of solidarity Friday declaring its support for the black community, providing resources for allyship with black people and raising awareness about an incident of a  police officer  approaching a black man with a stun gun.  The 2020-2021 USAC council decided to release the statement after someone on the council saw a video of the confrontation on Twitter, said Breeze Velazquez, the 2020-2021 Academic Affairs commissioner.  The purpose of the letter, in particular, was kind of to stand in solidarity with the efforts and call out ... anti-blackness and ... the entirety of UCPD and the way police are handling situations across America, said Velazquez, a second-year public affairs and Chicana and Chicano studies student.  USAC also released a  petition  requesting California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti for the removal of the National Guard in Westwood, following Garcettis order to deploy 1,000 National Guard troops in LA.  Naomi Riley, the 2020-2021 USAC president, said she hopes people of color will come together in unity to advocate for each other and is hoping for a steadfast future for people of color.  I think that right now more than anything, we need unity because those things cannot come without unity and without collective action, said Riley, a third-year political science student.  University of California Womxns Leadership Council also published a statement of solidarity, and released a nine-page resource guide on its Instagram page Sunday for students to educate themselves on how to take action in response to recent protests and police brutality.  Rhea Shetty, co-executive director of UCWLC and third-year biology and German language and cultures student, said they released the statement and resource sheet to show solidarity with the black community and take action beyond passive social media posts. Shetty said they talked with black leaders on campus to figure out how they can best support the black community and asked members for helpful resources.  It's on UCWLC to use our platform in any way to publicize resources and ways to take action for anyone following us and all of our members and people that are a part of the movement that we want to grow, Shetty said.  Jemima Pierre, an associate professor in the anthropology department, said she joined protests in Los Angeles this weekend. She was both surprised and unsurprised how recent events unfolded.  Floyds murder on camera became a catalyst in a way that other murders on camera have not, Pierre said. It's a long history of police violence and brutality and anti-black racism in this country that has been really coming together as in response to this George Floyd murder.  Robin Kelley, a distinguished professor in the history department, and Pierre are speaking to several media outlets, including USA Today, the Houston Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times, to advocate for change and support the black community.  Kelley said although there were some violent protesters, the majority of protesters he saw were peaceful.  Some protests in LA were near Kelleys house, Kelley said. Seeing a diverse group of protestors challenge police and the government was uplifting for him, he added.  They recognize that the system is killing people, not just with bullets, but killing people by sucking up resources that communities need to survive, he said.  Kelley said he doesnt think the protests are senseless considering the long history of police violence in the United States. He added that he became accustomed to news reports of police officers taking Black American lives growing up.  Every day, I'm surprised that there are not more blow-ups, more explosions, more rebellions, more influence. I mean, these are signs of very patient people, Kelley said. These protests all over the country are because I think people have had enough of it.  Jaira Fungula, a fourth-year African American studies student, said she stepped away from social media after seeing triggering images and videos of Floyds death.  Fungula added that she is struggling to find the motivation to finish the quarter.  The fact that we are in the midst of a pandemic and in the midst of exams trying to finish up school and not want to deal with these things ... there is just so much going in the world and it is hard to concentrate, she said.  Sam Chai, a second-year cognitive science student, started an art-based initiative to support the Black Lives Matter movement in light of recent events.  Chai creates free art pieces for those who show proof they donated to organizations supporting the black community. She started the initiative after being inspired by other artists doing similar actions.  Chai said she received more than 20 donations two days after starting the initiative, and hopes more people start their own initiatives to support the black community.  Fungula said recent protests symbolize refusal from the black community to remain silent.  We are not going to be silent and we will continue to fight until we see a change, until they listen to our basic rights, Fungula said.","['cap-mahnoor-ghatala', 'cap-sara-rashidi', 'cap-kari-lau']","['california', 'campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.news_.floydresponse.ADX_.jpg

That something so minuscule can act as one of the biggest threats currently imaginable to humanity is a testament to the ironically complex nature of viruses, which, without properly understanding, can make this disease even more baffling than it already is.    Here, we break down the basics of COVID-19 to try to make sense of the way it infiltrates the body.  A coronavirus is defined as a single-stranded RNA virus that typically leads to an upper respiratory infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, which was first reported in December in Wuhan, China, is of the same family of virus as the Middle East respiratory syndrome, the severe acute respiratory syndrome and even the common cold. Humans commonly fall ill at the hands of complications like bronchitis and pneumonia from less severe coronaviruses, and are able to recover.     Hong Zhou, a professor in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics as well as the director of the Electron Imaging Center for NanoMachines, explained how other coronaviruses function differently than the latest one.  The other coronaviruses are usually seasonal,"" Zhou said. ""We dont talk about them because they dont cause problems for humans.  The same cannot be said about the most recent coronavirus cousin.   The thing that sets it apart is that human immune systems have no idea what to do with it.  Scientists often describe this phenomenon by referring to the virus as novel. Given SARS-CoV-2 originated in animals, it is a pathogen that is not just unfamiliar to anyone's body but that is unbeknownst to the entirety of mankind, according to the  Mayo Clinic .  It is believed that COVID-19 may have originated in a  wet market  in Wuhan, China, which was home to animals sold for consumption. Animals provide a vehicle for the virus to spread and it can exist within them without humans ever knowing. Moreover, an environment like a wet market can be conducive to the spread of viruses since many different species share a small space where bodily fluids can drop from one cage to another and eventually to human handlers.  &nbsp;   [Related:    Campus Queries: For how long does the novel coronavirus remain infectious on different surfaces? ]        The microcosmic wet market ecosystem   example goes to show the ease at which such viruses   can spread among animals as well as people. However, when it comes to transmission, not all viruses are created equal.   The 2019 coronavirus is extremely contagious in comparison to its predecessors  : while all coronaviruses can spread through touch, it has become clear that COVID-19 may have a little bit more to it.  For starters, it's important to note that viruses are entirely dependent on the cells they infect. These nonviral cells contain their own code for the government of healthy cellular mechanisms. Viruses, however, do not care about the health of the cells they infect. They invade, bringing with them their own instruction manual, and proceed to usurp cellular resources in order to make more of themselves. In comparison to the thousands of genes contained within healthy human cells, viruses bring with them two to 10 genes  a gross oversimplification of whats required for health.  Picture a well-oiled democratic society with a complex system of checks and balances to keep everything running smoothly. Suddenly this society is overpowered by a ruler from another land who throws away the nuanced system and has the single goal of utilizing the resources of the city to help his people reproduce.  In   their quest to hijack the human cell, viruses must first bind to it by means of some structure or protein. All coronaviruses use what is called a spike protein, but the proteins present in SARS-CoV-2 bind a lot more tightly. Then,   the protein is activated by an enzyme called furin that is present in various human organs, essentially allowing the virus to attack the body from multiple different entry points causing potential failure in multiple different organs.  Studies  have shown the furin activation site discovered in SARS-CoV-2 is different than that of other coronaviruses, which likely influences the body's violent reaction to it.  These are mechanisms that give COVID-19 a certain competitive edge against other coronaviruses. All viruses, however, attack with a certain brutality that is built into their very machinery and part of their danger comes with the mutations that arise every so often.  Just like anything in nature, viruses have to figure out a way to exist, Zhou said. To gain existence, the virus must adapt to the environment.""   [Related:    UCLA announces aim to offer remote instruction option for fall quarter ]     Timothy Brewer, a professor of epidemiology in the Fielding School of Public Health, explained that many of the mutations that occur may be silent, thereby leaving   a virus unchanged in a meaningful way.  And so the question is, will there be some meaningful mutation that either makes the virus more or less deadly, or more easy or less easy to transmit?   he said. That certainly is possible, but we haven't seen any real evidence for that yet.  As a result of the complicated nature of viral mechanisms, there is still no cure to target COVID-19. Scientists around the world are  testing different contestants , but according to Brewer, the treatment plan will depend on the frequency of mutation.  We'll have to see if it is more like influenza, (where) the mutation rate really isn't that important for treatment, and we can use one medicine, or if it is more like HIV, where we might need to use combinations of medicines because it's mutating so rapidly, he said.  The timeline of such treatments for COVID-19 is still ambiguous. Zhou made clear that neither a treatment nor a vaccine will appear overnight. The polio vaccine, for example, was first widely used more than 60 years after the first epidemic began in the United States in 1894.  ""There is a process you have to follow for safety and efficacy,"" Zhou said. ""Many times it will not be successful and you have to repeat the process again.""  As we await the approval of something more permanent, the best way to combat the tiny virus that has brought society to a standstill may just be to stop its spread by staying at home and washing our hands. Understanding how   viral operations   work is the first step in figuring out how to overcome them and get back to life as we know it.",['cap-samantha-dorfan'],['quad'],https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/emily-illo-.jpeg

UCLA men&#8217;s soccer &#8211;  which finished second-to-last in the Pac-12 in coach Ryan Jorden&#8217;s inaugural season in 2019 &#8211; has responded by bringing in a fresh 11.  One week ago, Jorden announced his 2020 recruiting class, comprised of three forwards, three midfielders, four defenders and one goalkeeper &#8211; enough depth to hypothetically field a full team with a 4-3-3 formation.  The second-year coach said the positionally-diverse recruiting class addressed some of the weaknesses of the 2019 team, which finished with a 2-6-2 conference record &#8211; UCLA's worst in program history.   ""As we looked at the team from last year, we knew that we needed to fill a lot of different holes,&#8221; Jorden said. &#8220;We recruited a playing 11, with balance from goalkeeper to defenders to midfielders to attacking players. Through that process, we've been able to add great quality to the group in a very balanced nature.""  The three forwards added to the squad &#8211; Kevin Diaz, Jose Contell-Lechon and Grayson Doody &#8211;  will join the team after junior forward Milan Iloski signed a contract with Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer in January 2020. Iloski's 17 goals paced both his team and the conference, and the forward set a new school record for goals scored in a single game, finding the back of the net five times Oct. 6 against San Diego State.   In the midfield, UCLA added midfielders Tucker Lepley, Andrew Valverde and Connor Manning, with Manning hailing from England and being one of three recruits from European clubs.   Defenders Ahmed Longmire, Pablo Greenlee, Tommy Silva and Kasper Strom were added to the Bruins&#8217; backline, which allowed the most goals of any team in the conference last season, giving up 2.11 per game and 38 total on the season.  Rounding out the class is goalkeeper Tyler Kirberg, a U.S. Youth Soccer National Champion who is set to join sophomore Justin Garces and redshirt sophomore Cameron Douglas between the sticks.  With the addition of a full team&#8217;s worth of new players, Jorden said that training can provide desired competition.               &#8220;You try to get a competitive roster, so that every day in training, the competitive level is equal or greater to what the team will experience on game day,&#8221; Jorden said.

The Bruins missed the  NCAA Tournament in 2019 after qualifying for seven of the last 10 seasons, and Jorden said the coaching staff was looking for recruits that can help the program meet their own expectations.   ""We're always looking for talented players, and certainly as we looked at our team, the objective was to find a talented group that should fall in line with what a UCLA soccer team should look like,&#8221; Jorden said. ""We should have a team that has both the ability and quality to be competing for National Championships, and to compete at the highest level.&#8221;  Jorden also said that that while he was on the recruiting trail, he kept an eye out for players that not only exhibited technical skill, but a good attitude on the pitch with a team-first mentality.  ""Along with having raw, innate ability, I don't think (competing for a national championship) can be possible if you don't have players with character and certainly personality,&#8221; Jorden said. &#8220;We've got a really fantastic group of guys, from a personal quality standpoint and personality standpoint.&#8221; ",['cap-michael-waldman'],"['mens-soccer', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/5.12.sp_.msoccer.recruits-01.png

UCLA Athletics released a statement Wednesday morning stating it would be entering the first phase of its four-phase Return to Training process June 22. Starting Monday, fall athletes &nbsp;both on Olympic sport teams and football &nbsp;will be permitted to return to campus for voluntary training activities.    The first phase, or the Return to Campus phase, will consist of COVID-19 and antibody testing  the frequency of which was not specified &nbsp;in addition to the screening of student-athletes mental and physical well-being as they get back to Westwood. The second phase, or the Return to Athletic Performance stage, will include team activities of 10 or fewer student-athletes at a time, according to the Los Angeles Times. Phase three will be the resumption of full team practices and phase four will be the return to scheduled, on-the-field competition.    Dates for phases two through four have yet to be determined, but the Los Angeles Times Ben Bolch reported that phase one will last anywhere between three and 10 days.    Only the Olympic sport athletes who live locally were encouraged to return to Westwood, however, all football players were invited back. The statement designates the impacted fall sports as football, mens and womens soccer, womens volleyball, mens water polo and cross country, but does not give any updates for mens and womens golf or tennis, all of which boast fall seasons of their own.    Student-athletes will not be required to come back to campus Monday, and UCLA Athletics said team-by-team communication would be going on all week in order to help them and their families make informed decisions on their returns.    Later Wednesday afternoon, the NCAA Division I Council approved a timeline that would give football programs six weeks to practice on campus before the season begins  Aug.  29, meaning UCLAs first required workouts could come as soon as July 6.  &nbsp;    The NCAA also approved a plan that would allow mens and womens basketball teams to begin summer activities July 20, according to CBS Sports Jon Rothstein, but UCLA has yet to provide an update on the Bruins timeline on the court.

The robots delivering Silveys groceries are from Cyan Robotics, a delivery company founded by UCLA alumni Zach Rash and Brad Squicciarini.  The two alumni began Cyan Robotics after they graduated in 2019 with degrees in computer science.  They had a mutual interest in self-driving technology, Squicciarini said.  During his second year at UCLA, Rash read a biography about Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, in which Musk described his prospective plans for self-driving cars. Rash became interested in the concept, prompting the pair to get more involved with robotic navigation research in the UCLA Connected Autonomous Electric Vehicle lab.  Initially, they wanted to build an autonomous golf cart, but they couldnt find a parking space for it. Instead, they focused on smaller prototypes that could be brought in and out of the lab. They began researching navigation learning approaches, gaining experience in deploying robots into the real world. After seeing other companies attempt delivery businesses, the two decided to try it for themselves with Cyan Robotics.  Their original plan was to start their business in May 2020, but they moved their launch date up to April because of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Squicciarini said.  They hope to encourage social distancing by reducing the number of trips people living within a 5-mile radius of UCLA have to take to the grocery store.  Our short-term goal during the pandemic is to reduce trips to the grocery store, Squicciarini said. Our long-term goal with Cyan is to bring robotics into everyday life and not just in research labs and industrial settings.  Customers can purchase the company's products online from 12 p.m. to 9 p.m. and can expect a text message notifying them that their order has arrived, which takes under 30 minutes on average, Rash said.  When an order is placed, robots are packed with products at Cyan Robotics warehouses, which they call fulfillment centers. Supervisors then monitor the robots remotely as they deliver the products to the customer.  Cyan Robotics offers products that are being sought after during the pandemic, such as face masks, cleaning products, fresh produce, snacks, drinks and personal hygiene products, among others. Its goal is to stock items that are in high demand at grocery stores and deliver them at an affordable price, Rash said.  Customers can also request products not sold on the company's website to be stocked for the future.  Many of its customers order multiple times a week, Rash said.  Silvey, for instance, orders every two to three days.  If she runs out of a single item, Silvey said it is more convenient for her to get it delivered rather than go to a grocery store. She said ordering between her bigger trips to the store saves her stress and anxiety.  Its a very seamless experience and I feel like it makes groceries simple again, Silvey said.  Silvey said she does not feel guilty for ordering often because of the minimal human contact and the inexpensive delivery fee of $1.  The company also does not have an order minimum.  Large order minimums are not super accessible if you're running on a college budget, and so we want to make on-demand delivery of groceries more accessible, Rash said.  The company is currently trying to expand into other neighborhoods and provide its services to more people due to the pandemic, Rash said. This expansion is quicker than anticipated.  Luckily, we're fortunate enough to coincidentally be in a business that is not going to be stunted by the pandemic, so were in a situation where we can help and be a useful service to people, Rash said.",['cap-kaitlin-browne'],"['news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/cyanrobot.jpg

Detailed budget reports for the CRC and SIOC are unavailable to the public, and to members of the committees themselves.  Currently, the committees' budgets are split between a student-controlled programming budget and a fixed administrative budget overseen by CPO administrators.   [Related link:    Public information is lacking for over $2 million used by two campus committees   ]   CRC and SIOC members used to directly control all of their committees&#8217; budgets. However, the committees now control about half of their budgets because of changes in their budget structure from 2009 to 2017. These changes have been criticized by USAC for violating the committees' guiding documents, known as statements of understanding.  CRC members are now unable to see all of their committee&#8217;s budget reports, including reports for the programming funds that they control, said Zuleika Bravo, a fourth-year political science student who sits on the CRC.  As a result, CRC members must make funding decisions without knowing how much remains in their budget, said Bravo, the 2020-2021 USAC transfer student representative.  CPO administrators also did not give the SIOC a complete budget report, and only verbally informed committee members of the budget breakdown, said Breanna Aguilar, a fourth-year gender studies and Chicana/o studies student who sits on the SIOC.  CPO's business officer Angela Hernandez has denied multiple requests by CRC members to see complete budget reports, Bravo said.  &#8220;(CRC members) brought that to the attention of (CPO administration),&#8221; Bravo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really just them saying, &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry about it; we&#8217;ll let you know if (the budget) is over.&#8217; They never really tell us how much we can spend.&#8221;  Hernandez did not respond to requests for comment.   Tracking budgets   The 2018-2019 CRC and SIOC budgets totaled $2,506,767, which includes administrative costs, programming costs and the committees&#8217; leftover balance.  The CRC and the SIOC allocated $1,332,269, or about half of the committees' 2018-2019 budgets. CPO professional staff controlled $910,405 in its administrative budget last year. The committees had a combined $264,094 leftover balance.  The CRC and SIOC each initially allocated about $340,000 of their respective programming budgets to outreach and retention projects in their 2018-2019 budget plans. Because of additional and unforeseen costs, the SIOC's initial allocation grew to over $570,000, said Uriah Blackwell, the SIOC chair. The CRC's initial allocation also grew to over $760,000 by the end of the year.   Since 2009, the CRC and SIOC budget has been restructured at least twice because of financial problems. In both cases, some administrative costs that were previously funded by the university have been shifted to students.  Because of universitywide financial struggles in 2009, UCLA reduced funding to the CRC and SIOC, said Assistant Vice Chancellor of Campus Life Mick Deluca in an April 14  emailed statement to USAC .  In response, both committees reduced their programming allocations to pay for administrative costs previously covered by the university. Staffing costs, which are paid out of both the administrative and programming budgets, accounted for $1,755,174 of the committees&#8217; budgets last year.  The CRC and SIOC budgets were restructured again in 2017, using student fees from the  2016 Social Justice Referendum , which increased student fees by $24.99 per quarter.  The 2017 budget restructuring also saw the committees further increase their allocations to staff salaries and other administrative costs, said Blackwell, a fourth-year African American studies student.    That year, the CRC and SIOC increased their allocations to staffing costs by about $150,000.  The restructuring also created the SJR 2-Year Promise Fund, which serves as a reserve fund for potential financial struggles. The fund currently has $1.2 million and grows by $300,000 each year, but it is unclear how it is being funded.  Although university finances have generally recovered since 2009, the restructuring of the committee budgets has not been reversed. The CRC and SIOC funds previously used for outreach and retention projects continue to be used for administrative costs.   Addressing violations    USAC members have criticized the CRC and SIOC for budgetary procedures that they say violate the committees&#8217; statements of understanding, known as SOUs.  The CRC and SIOC are required to submit an annual budget report to USAC by Oct. 1 and Sept. 30 respectively, according to the committees&#8217; SOUs. The two committees have not formally presented their budgets to USAC in at least four years, which is an ongoing SOU violation, said 2019-2020 USAC President Robert Watson.  In November, USAC requested complete budget reports from the CRC and the SIOC for the past three years, which USAC received in March. CRC Chair Stephany Barrera and Blackwell met with USAC members twice in February to address transparency concerns, but the meetings were unproductive, said Blackwell and Watson, a fourth-year political science student.  USAC voted March 10 to  withhold about $800,000 of fall quarter student fees  from the CRC and SIOC until the committees published its budget reports.  Two days later, UCLA Campus Life, which oversees the CPO, sent  three years of budget reports  to USAC.  Blackwell said he thinks the CRC and SIOC did not violate their SOUs because UCLA Campus Life sent budget reports to USAC in March.  However, the March reports were not sufficient, said Watson and USAC General Representative 1 Eduardo Velazquez.  &#8220;To call that a budget report is inaccurate in the first place,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically a ledger summary or ledger report. ... To give (USAC) a one-page document, that doesn&#8217;t go into any degree of detail about any expenditures, is not a budget report.&#8221;  Between 2011 and 2014, the CRC and the SIOC used memorandums to split their budgets into an administrative budget and a programming budget, which permanently fixed the administrative budget and removed it from the committee&#8217;s direct control, Deluca said.  However, the use of memos to split the budgets may also have violated the committees&#8217; SOUs.  Significant changes to either committees&#8217; structure must be approved by USAC, according to the  committees&#8217; SOUs . However, there are no records of USAC approval for the budget splits in the last 10 years of council meeting minutes, Watson said. Since the budget splits significantly changed the committees&#8217; structure without USAC approval, they violated the committees&#8217; SOUs, Velazquez and Watson said.  However, Blackwell denied that the budget split was an SOU violation.  &#8220;(The budget split) was basically passed by students to ensure that (SIOC) projects would all have a full-time staff member, which does not change the structure of the SIOC,&#8221; Blackwell said.  SIOC members can review and overturn the memos by a two-thirds majority, Blackwell said. However, Bravo and Aguilar said they were unable to receive a copy of the budget split memos despite multiple requests. Committee members need to review and verify the memos before taking a vote to overturn them, Aguilar added.  &#8220;If these memos were passed, (the committee members) should be able to revisit those to make knowledgeable decisions and change those decisions,&#8221; Aguilar said.  The SIOC&#8217;s guiding documents require that all of its funds be controlled by the SIOC itself. The CRC&#8217;s guiding documents require that all funds from certain student referendum fees prior to 1999 be controlled by the CRC, but does not state who controls the fees from referendums passed after 1999.  &#8220;The (referendum) language is very clear that the fee shall be given to the SIOC and the CRC,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;When you take ... hundreds of thousands of dollars away from the committees that they&#8217;re designed to go to, ... it&#8217;s certainly a violation of the SOU.&#8221;   Moving forward     At the  April 28 USAC meeting , Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Monroe Gorden said he should be held accountable for SOU violations.  &#8220;One of the primary parties that the campus holds responsible for the SOUs is the vice chancellor of Student Affairs,&#8221; Gorden said. &#8220;(If there are practices) that don&#8217;t comport with the SOU, I&#8217;ve become primarily the person who has to be held accountable.&#8221;  USAC members and Gorden met May 8 to discuss the SOU violations, said Velazquez, a fourth-year Chicana/o studies student. The meeting resulted in several commitments from UCLA Student Affairs, Watson added.  The CRC and SIOC will now present budget reports at the beginning of each year, and a working group will be formed to address transparency concerns, Velazquez said. The working group will be composed of representatives from USAC, the CRC, the SIOC and UCLA Student Affairs.  Associated Students UCLA will also work with these groups, said UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez in an emailed statement.  UCLA Campus Life, which operates under UCLA Student Affairs, created a format for CRC and SIOC budget reports, which will be shared with the committees and USAC, Deluca said. However, it is unclear if the format will include both the programming and administrative budgets.  Watson said he is unsure whether the working group with UCLA Student Affairs will be successful in resolving SOU violations.  ""I&#8217;m nervous about if that will happen, because it hasn&#8217;t happened; (SOU violations) have been happening for years now,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;It makes me nervous to see if (the working group) will be effective in accomplishing that goal.&#8221;  ",['cap-justin-jung'],"['campus', 'news', 'student-government']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/CPO-graphics-1024x692.png

Amid all of the chaos surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak is the rapid spread of misinformation about the virus, its origins and its effects. This misinformation ranges from uplifting stories of environmental progress and animal tomfoolery to more dangerous and unsubstantiated claims on the virus' origins and how to avoid contracting it.     One alarming category of misinformation is composed of conspiracy theories about how the virus was introduced.   For example, one theory attempts to accuse a laboratory in Wuhan, China, for allowing the virus to leave the lab or for even bioengineering the virus themselves.  However, a group of public health scientists highlight, in a published statement by  The Lancet , the strong evidence that falsifies these rumors and reveals the virus to be of natural origin. More importantly, these scientists uphold the work of the scientists and health professionals in China and emphasize how theories like this only serve as a detriment to the ability of scientists around the world to work together in pursuit of a common goal.  Another hub of misinformation involves preventative measures and potential cures for the virus.   Specifically, there are pieces of information floating around the Internet stating that acts like gargling warm salt water, consuming a certain type of silver or drinking frequent sips of water can prevent an individual from contracting the virus or can stop the virus' progression. Though these methods differ, they share at least one common thread &#8211; a lack of substantial evidence to support their claims.   Additionally, people have been promoting the ingestion of chlorine dioxide solutions like Miracle Mineral Solution in order to ""cure"" the coronavirus. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a statement in August 2019 warning the public about the very dangerous consequences of consuming these products &#8211; including potentially fatal low blood pressure.  Ultimately, these at-home remedies may provide people   some peace of mind, but this false sense can be detrimental in light of both the dangerous quality of some of the methods themselves and the potential to discourage an individual from adhering to scientifically backed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.   [Related:  LA County expands COVID-19 testing to any resident showing symptoms ]    Nevertheless, the misinformation that has emerged recently is not limited to shoddy medical advice. Strangely enough, there have been several instances of uplifting yet untrue animal stories in the midst of all of this.  Viral social media posts about swans and dolphins in the Venice canals and drunken elephants in a garden outside a village in China provided temporary joy and comic relief in this otherwise frightening and uncertain time.  However, the swans and dolphins were not filmed in the Venice canals, and a news report from China stated that the elephants in the photo were not the ones who had passed through the village claimed in the post.  The individual responsible for creating the viral tweet about the swans claimed to be unaware that the information contained in her post was false. Thus, at least as far as the swans are concerned, we can see that sometimes the spread of false information online is unintentional.     Though under normal circumstances, potential disease cures and homecoming animals may lack commonality. In a time where there is no shortage of heartbreaking headlines, these once disparate things seem to mutually reflect the world's simple desire for positivity.  Emanuel   Maidenberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine, explained why we feel the way we do in this unsettling situation and how we should navigate these feelings as it relates to our intake of information.  ""We all want for it to end, we all want to be safe, we all want to return to normal life,"" Maidenberg said. ""All of these are normal human instincts and feelings and desires. We have to respect them, we have to be aware of them, but we also have to remind ourselves that the only thing that will lead us out of it is hard science and scientific data.""  Nevertheless, in times like these, there seems to be no shortage of instances that may make us more likely to believe false information.   R. Kelly Garrett, a professor of communication at The Ohio State University, explains in a  recently published article  that individuals process large quantities of information in a sequential fashion &#8211; first with tactics like intuition and emotion, then with reason. This way of processing can lead us to make errors that become even more prevalent in crisis conditions when we feel uncertainty and lack of control.   Accordingly, large tech companies such as Facebook and Google have taken measures to attempt to limit the spread of misinformation about the coronavirus online. For example, the companies try to highlight information from reputable news sources and remove or flag posts found to contain inaccurate information.   The level of misinformation during this crisis is extremely high, and some of it inevitably goes undetected. We may not be able to stop the posting of misinformation, but we can adjust the way we interact with it.   For example, later in Garrett&#8217;s article, she shares ways that people can approach informatio  n in order to limit the spread of and our susceptibility to misinformation.  First, he advises that individuals slow down and avoid immediately sharing information that may not be true. Second, he advises that people think critically about the information they are consuming and see whether many experts support it before accepting it.   To be fair, this may be easier said than done as some pieces of information are more difficult to parse than others. Still, using these tools is a good start in being smarter consumers of information.  At the end of the day, the ability to spread information among a world brought together by this common threat may be one of our greatest weapons against it.  However, the novelty of this situation makes misinformation almost inevitable, and it is important to be reminded of that when consuming and distributing information &#8211; even if you come across some elephants that seem just too amusing not to share.

At the time, the coronavirus was just a story to me, a short news brief to write and follow up on. Nevertheless, as days passed and the disease threaded its way throughout the country and the rest of the globe, it became more of a constant. It hovered at the edges of articles I edited, got dissected in my film class and made me paranoid about my roommates cough.  My familys concern grew alongside the case count in LA, with loved ones texting and calling me at odd hours to see if I was OK and asking when I was planning to come home. When UCLA first made the decision to move classes online until April 10, my parents decided to get me home before the situation worsened.   ""As an international student on an F-1 visa, my ability to remain in the United States at the time was contingent on full-time, in-person enrollment.""     My first reaction was to fight them. As an international student on an F-1 visa, my ability to remain in the United States at the time was contingent on full-time, in-person enrollment. With online classes, my future seemed murky as is.  What if in-person instruction started up again and I couldnt return to campus? What if everchanging travel restrictions meant I was stranded at an airport in between flights? What if I was forced into a government quarantine facility? What if I made a relative sick?  In retrospect, my fears felt overwrought  just the caffeine-addled, late-night ramblings of a stressed student before finals week.  Then, all the anxiety boiled over early one morning. I had been woken up by another call  my aunt checking on me  and I couldnt help but sit down at the foot of my roommates bed and cry.  Staying put or going home was a decision that still hurts to think about. Luckily, I didnt have to make one.  Upon UCLAs announcement that remote instruction would continue throughout spring quarter, the UCLA Dashew Center for International Students sent out an email stating F-1 Visa statuses would not be terminated as long as students maintained full-time enrollment, even with online classes. I could spend spring quarter home in New Delhi with no fear of halting my future in Los Angeles.  I rented a storage unit and after some more compromising with my parents, decided to fly home Friday of finals week, only after my exams were finished. That did not happen.  As finals week began, it started seeming more and more likely that the Indian government would start sealing its borders. Despite familial anxieties rising again, I managed to finish an exam and store half of my things by March 18. That night, I worked on packing everything else; by the time I slept it was 3 a.m. on March 19. A little over a day before my flight home.  My mother woke me up with a call less than four hours later. The Indian government had banned incoming international flights starting from March 22, when I had been scheduled to arrive.   ""Staying put or going home was a decision that still hurts to think about. Luckily, I didnt have to make one.""     Although Im sure a small part of me had braced myself for the worst, I couldnt help but panic. My parents had booked me on a 3 p.m. flight out of LA, giving me less than six hours to finish packing, get to Public Storage, come back to campus, leave campus and reach the airport in time.  I pulled everything off my walls, pins flying everywhere. Whatever clothes and belongings I couldnt fit into my one suitcase were thrown into my last box. Whatever couldnt fit in the box went into plastic bags I held in my hands. My blanket and sheets, still warm from the sleep Id been shaken from, were the last to go, ripped from my bed and stuffed into my laundry bag.  A week or so later, my roommate would send me angry texts about the pins, the dust bunnies on my desk and the fact I didnt vacuum.  But the afternoon of March 19, as I pulled into Los Angeles International Airport with a mask tight on my face, all I was thinking about was how this wasnt how Id planned to say goodbye to the city, the campus and my sophomore year. This wasnt how Id planned to leave.  When I arrived in New Delhi, I realized that my return wasnt going to be anything as like Id planned either.  I landed late March 20, roughly a day before the ban was enforced, to an airport choked with citizens coming home from every part of the world. With every giant line, people swelled with an agitation that seemed infectious in more ways than one.  The tension was understandable. Hundreds were packed into tight hallways, stretching from immigration to the food court where a medical facility had been set up. Airport security had taken our passports, returning them only after wed been checked by a doctor.  It took me six hours to see one.  I felt myself holding my breath so I wouldnt accidentally sniffle or cough. I had imagined someone pushing a swab down my throat or interrogating me about my eyes, puffy and red from travel. Instead, I got a brief interview regarding my travel history and any possible symptoms.  Pulling my suitcase out of the airport, the back of my hand freshly stamped with the fact I had to be self-quarantined, I couldnt help but think  thats it? Thats going to be enough to protect a population of over 1 billion people?  Then I saw my mom, masked and gloved, waiting to bring me home. Over my next two weeks in self-isolation, a local police officer would call our home to check whether Id contracted any symptoms. Indias travel ban was augmented by a national lockdown on March 25. Though it was only meant to last three weeks, it was soon extended to May 3.  Maybe thatll be enough. But maybe it wont.  On April 19, dozens of residents of the apartment complex I live in came out on their balconies to play a socially distanced version of bingo. Standing on the grounds below, a person yelled out numbers through a megaphone for players to scratch off. To signal a win, a family would have to bang whatever they could  pots, pans, whatever was noisy enough  against their railings.  I hadnt left the house in five weeks and was caught off guard by how nice it was outside. The sunset painted all the buildings a golden pink, the streets were ridiculously free of cars and my old beagle had squashed himself next to me.

The study, which was published April 1 by the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Initiative and the UCLA Center for Neighborhood Knowledge, sought to locate neighborhoods in LA County that are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus because of their large number of at-risk workers.  The researchers identified two sectors of the service workforce &#8211; hospitality and retail &#8211; that are especially at risk for coronavirus-induced layoffs.  Next, they examined the location, racial-ethnic composition, socioeconomic circumstances and foreign-born status of workers in these sectors to locate economically vulnerable neighborhoods.  These vulnerable workers are disproportionately from racial minority backgrounds, said Carla Vasquez-Noriega, a public policy fellow at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Initiative who co-authored the report.  Vasquez-Noriega said 40% of Asian-majority neighborhoods and 57% of Latino-majority neighborhoods are at high risk with respect to retail and hospitality COVID-19-related economic impacts, versus only 12.2% of white-majority neighborhoods.  Immigrants are also particularly vulnerable to the economic impacts of the coronavirus because they tend to take on jobs in the service industry, said Chhandara Pech, assistant director of the UCLA Center for Neighborhood Knowledge.  Workers in these two sectors tend to be more at risk because they earn lower wages compared to other people in the service workforce, according to the study. A typical retail worker makes about $23,000 a year, while a typical service worker in hospitality makes about $20,000. Workers in all other sectors of the workforce make about $50,000 a year, according to the study.  Additionally, with state-mandated business closures and a sharp decline in consumer demands, workers who can&#8217;t work from home face unemployment, Pech said.  &#8220;(Workers in these sectors) don&#8217;t have the opportunity to work from home, so they are losing income because they&#8217;ve been either laid off or furloughed,&#8221; said Pech, who conducted the statistical analysis for the study. &#8220;And what we learned in past recessions is that a lot of businesses completely close after a crisis, so a lot of folks will lose their jobs.&#8221;  These workers are also especially vulnerable at this time because they lack employment benefits, said Silvia Gonz&#225;lez, co-author of the study and a graduate student in urban planning.  &#8220;People working in retail, people who clean homes, people who help you pick out stuff at the store usually do not have the same type of benefits as someone with a job at UCLA,&#8221;  Gonz&#225;lez said. &#8220;You have a disparity in the types of benefits that are offered.&#8221;  Pech said they conducted the study to help local and state policymakers see the economic impacts in LA County and to prescribe actionable policy recommendations.  &#8220;The west side (of LA County) tends to be more affluent, with affluent workers,&#8221; Pech said. &#8220;So if we are thinking about the recovery plan, this research allows us to identify where local officials could &#8211; instead of focusing on all of LA &#8211; target their resources to focus on communities where we know have a high population of workers who are vulnerable.&#8221;  By protecting these hotspot neighborhoods, leaders can protect everyone, Gonz&#225;lez said.  &#8220;This pandemic has really proven that we need to provide adequate support for the most vulnerable,&#8221; Gonz&#225;lez said. &#8220;When we are not providing for the most vulnerable, we are also putting everybody else at risk.&#8221; ",['cap-genesis-qu'],"['los-angeles', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.economicrisk.file_.jpg

Bruin Bucks tackles the confusing parts of personal finance they dont teach you in school.   It's no secret that the current pandemic is wreaking havoc on the U.S. economy  nearly 33 million Americans have lost their jobs since the virus hit about seven weeks ago.  This is not to mention, with a   rising unemployment rate and no guarantee that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be developed anytime soon  if at all  financial experts suggest that the U.S. economy is on the brink of its worst downfall since the Great Depression.  While it may be frightening to contemplate finances in the wake of this crisis, the Quad is here to help you save money and maybe even make some extra dough  all from the comfort of your own home.  To begin, many financial experts cite careful budgeting as an effective way to monitor your finances.     According to Michelle Black, a leading credit expert and personal finance writer for Forbes Magazine, the first step   of budgeting involves taking a detailed inventory of your essential expenses. In other words, you should try to identify how much you spend on necessities like housing, utilities, transportation and food. All of these services are vital to maintaining your health and safety, and therefore should be prioritized in the budgeting process.  From there, Black suggests calculating and limiting expenses on all nonessentials like take-out, online shopping and entertainment.   While reducing   these ""nice-to-haves"" is often   disappointing  ,   small expenses can quickly add up.  To determine whether youre staying on track with your budgeting goals, there are also a wide variety of apps to use. Popular options include  Mint, PocketGuard, Wally  and  YNAB .  While every app has its nuances, each allows you to track your spending on linked credit and debit cards against your income and customized budget. Other common features include the ability to track spending by category and to receive notifications both before and after exceeding your budget. Don't have an app? Old-fashioned pen and paper works too.  However, budgeting alone may not be enough to solve all financial challenges.  Thankfully, many essential agencies such as insurance companies and banks have adapted their policies with coronavirus in mind  many agencies are allowing payment deferrals on credit cards, car insurance and rent.  Likewise, financial planner Tiffany Aliche suggests looking to see if any of your fees are being waived, and prioritizing the payments that are not. Additionally, Aliche encourages asking your car insurance company to lower their rates if, like many, you are spending little to no time on the road right now.  Its also important to note that the U.S. governments 2020 Federal Stimulus Package includes leniency on student debt.  Specifically, i nterest will not accrue on federal student loans from April 1 through Sept. 30 and no payments must be made during this time. If you're unsure as to whether your student loan is eligible under this program,  Forbes has an overview .  While we have some control over how we budget our expenses, another major financial dictator  the stock market  largely exceeds our control.  In mid-March, the   U.S.   stock market took a significant plunge of about 12%,   foreshadowing the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. However, while stock prices of retailers, airlines and hotel chains continue to fall, not all companies are experiencing declines. For example, stock prices for Chipotle Mexican Grill have actually risen since the start of the outbreak  reaching highs last seen by the company in 2015.  Amid these mixed results, what constitutes wise investing can be confusing.  Lincoln Financial Group, a Fortune 250 investment management company, attempts to provide clarity by describing the four strategies investors can take during these turbulent times: opportunistic, steady, uncertain and apprehensive, and discussing the merits of each.  An opportunistic approach entails taking advantage of reduced stock prices to make additional investments. While there is no guarantee that you will see a return on your investment, data following the 2008 financial crisis showed that a $10,000 investment made while the market was still at a low grew by 53% in the first six months of market recovery.  According to Steve Brice, chief investment strategist at Standard Chartered Private Bank, times of financial crisis can serve as entry points to the market for novice investors. Brice said that those without assets in the market should get started while stock prices are undervalued. Specifically, he thinks technology and health care stocks will likely see an increase due to COVID-19.  However, some may choose to be slightly more conservative in the face of financial uncertainty by adopting what Lincoln Financial considers a steady approach. If this is the case, Lincoln Financial suggests investors leave their existing investment portfolio unaltered in order to help them stay in the market.  The remaining two approaches, uncertain and apprehensive, involve removing assets from the stock market. An uncertain investor waits until the market recovers to move their money into what they see as a less risky investment. Meanwhile, an apprehensive investor pulls all their assets out of the market while its at a low in an attempt to save the funds they have left.  Although these two approaches may feel like smart decisions during a financial crisis, Lincoln Financial cautions its clients from moving their money during a market low. For example, the data collected after the 2008 financial crisis showed that investors who liquidated their assets stayed out of the stock market for a significant period after the crisis was resolved, which prevented their money from growing in the long run.  Nonetheless, while this data suggests leaving your money in the market can lead to the greatest long-term growth, some may find it more appealing to avoid uncertainty in the short-term.  To eliminate volatility and market risk, you can move your money to a certificate of deposit or money market account. CDs are a type of savings account offered through banks and are FDIC insured, which means theyre backed by the federal government. CDs are designed to pay you a predetermined interest rate on your money, so these accounts arent as vulnerable to market fluctuations.  MMAs allow you to earn interest on your money, but are generally more flexible with the withdrawal of funds. Therefore, MMAs are better for those who want to readily access their money, while funds in a CD must remain untouched for at least several months post-deposit.  At the end of the day, there's no denying that the coronavirus pandemic has caused stock market fluctuations and other economic changes that have resulted in financial distress for many.   While we stay at home, we can use this time as an opportunity to learn more about managing our money and adopting strategies that can prepare us for the weeks, months and years to come.",['cap-jenna-hajny'],"['bruin-bucks', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/BruinBucks.Online-1024x512.jpg

Despite previous missteps, Sunday night&#8217;s episode of ""Killing Eve"" was the perfect penultimate present.      With just enough action to make up for previous unsatisfying episodes while still preserving the quintessential &#8220;Killing Eve&#8221; guessing game, &#8220;Beautiful Monster&#8221; finally capitalized on the power of the show &#8211;  its three leading women. Previous episodes have danced from one woman to another, which helped the grand scheme of the story but offered disappointing stand-alone segments. Yet Sunday&#8217;s episode finally found each of the women settled in their own elements while carrying a tad   more emotional baggage than before.   [Related:    &#8216;Killing Eve&#8217; season 3 recap &#8211; episode 6: &#8216;End of Game&#8217;   ]   The episode opened with Villanelle (Jodie Comer) sick and tired of selling her existence to the Twelve only to receive nothing in exchange. After an odd meeting with the bizarre head of operations for the international crime syndicate, Villanelle decided to distance herself from the organization. But despite attempting to get away from her hitman duty, Villanelle still stayed true to her homicidal nature by attempting high order kills.  Villanelle's first target was her old mentor-turned-adult-babysitter Dasha (Harriet Walter) who's looming presence smothered Villanelle's usually unadulterated lifestyle. The two traveled together to Scotland ostensibly to complete yet another assassination. The combination of Villanelle's rebellion, her green feather overcoat and her new bubbly Scottish intonation made the kill on the golf course a welcome callback to the delightfully stylish violence typical of ""Killing Eve.""  And the never-before-used accent also brought out an interesting element of Villanelle. After a few misogynist comments from a painfully stereotypical American man, Villanelle made the startling decision to give Dasha a club to the head   rather than the offensive tourist from across the Atlantic, leaving the old woman to die on the 16th hole. The move was a suitable ending to suffocating chapter in Villanelle&#8217;s life &#8211; but it makes Dasha's eventual resurrection that much more concerning.    The old woman's survival was surprising to say the least, considering Villanelle rarely leaves stones unturned &#8211; but unfinished business was the name of Villanelle's moral arc Sunday. Later, as she attempted to escape the watchful eyes of the Twelve, her old ally Konstantin (Kim Bodnia) keeled over with a heart attack. Though she swiftly chose her freedom over his safety, Villanelle still shed a rare tear signifying her earnest hope for his eventual recovery. It is unprecedented for Villanelle to leave two people dying rather than dead, and her shifting mortality leads into exciting and uncharted territory for an otherwise meticulous assassin.  Although the second half of the season has belonged to Villanelle, &#8220;Beautiful Monster&#8221; also reunited the storyline with the mysteriously missing     Eve (Sandra Oh). And while her absence in previous episodes was disappointing, the delayed gratification was certainly satisfying when she finally resurfaced   and connected a few crucial dots leading her to Villanelle. Eve's surrogate and office assistant Bear perfectly summarized this episode's strength when he deemed   Eve to be at her most brilliant when up against a wall in search of Villanelle.   [Related:    &#8216;Killing Eve&#8217; season 3 recap &#8211; episode 5: &#8216;Are You From Pinner?&#8217;   ]    But of all the characters at their best, Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw) was particularly captivating. She thrives in challenging situations, and despite not making breakthroughs with the MI6 connection to the Twelve, her daughter Geraldine (Gemma Whelan) supplied more than enough opposition in this episode. One thing became clear: Carolyn isn&#8217;t actually as emotionless as earlier episodes may have insinuated. The burden of restraining her emotions reached a literal breaking point in   &#8220;Beautiful Monster,&#8221; as she smashed several vases against her sitting room walls. And really, there is nothing like watching Carolyn Martens absolutely decimate porcelain.  In addition to spotlighting the principal cast, episode seven also marked the long-awaited merging of two worlds. Visually, Eve and Villanelle now seem to live in the same bubble, in which Eve's cynical world is overwhelmed by Villanelle's darkness. The episode was one of the first in recent memory without a blue sky, set mostly among the mists of Britain. As for their attire, Villanelle's dress' earth-toned greens and blues recalled the usual blandness of Eve's attire. On the contrary, Eve was blatantly dressed in orange, a keen reference to Villanelle&#8217;s brighter days and puffy dresses in Barcelona.  And while the episode's near-miss ending between Eve and Villanelle harkens back to season one's knick-of-time frustrations, their calm parting wave makes it clear that the two of them are no longer chasing each other. Instead, it's the Twelve and MI6 chasing the two of them. Even though the consequences of their colliding worlds have yet to reveal themselves, the anticipation is certainly building for the season finale.  Previous episodes were chock-full of growing pains, but   Sunday night&#8217;s show was the product of a maturing series. &#8220;Beautiful Monster&#8221; was aptly named for its darker and more nuanced approach to character,   finally taking full advantage of all three female powerhouses that have emotionally ebbed and flowed throughout the series. The two near-deaths of Dasha and Konstantin combined with a less desperate Eve and Carolyn's destruction of decor all culminate into a wonderfully satisfying yet eerily unsettling lead up to a season finale.  Episode seven was nothing less than a gift laced with ribbon &#8211; now all that&#8217;s left is for the finale to add the finishing bow.

Since he was a high school junior, Chelebian had hoped to participate in the Terjenian-Thomas Assembly Internship Program, which places college students of Armenian descent in internships in Washington, D.C., About 20 students are accepted each year, and this year, Chelebian was one of them.  I was super excited when I found out that I got in, but especially to be surrounded by so much history for a whole two months in our nation's capital, Chelebian said. Through this program they set up tons of meet and greets and tours for us, which I was especially pumped for.  He expected to hear back in late March about whether or not he had been placed in a congressional internship. Instead, he was told his internship was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Though the program guaranteed him a spot if he reapplied next summer, he said he still felt heartbroken.  I was absolutely devastated, he said. I had planned my entire summer around this.  Like Chelebian, many students' plans for advancing their careers this summer were upended by the coronavirus pandemic.  According to a  survey  by the UCLA Career Center, 23% of employers surveyed by the center said they were unsure if they could honor their internship or job offers for students. Two percent of employers said they will honor some of their offers, and 1% said they could not honor any offers, the survey states.  Half of the internships  posted  on the website Glassdoor have closed since the pandemic first hit the U.S., with a 52% drop in job openings from March 9 to April 13.  After being rejected from many internships, Chris Dang, a second-year econometrics and quantitative economics student, secured a summer internship at the Walt Disney Company in Los Angeles, only to have it canceled.  Getting rejected is one thing, Dang said. Getting rescinded, I think that hurts a little bit more,  Dang was also offered an internship with a financial consulting company in Vietnam, where he is originally from. The firm did not rescind its offer, but Dang decided not to take it because he did not want to risk contracting the coronavirus and possibly infecting his family.  Some students internships havent been canceled but instead moved online.  According to the UCLA Career Center study, 16% of employers said they may be adjusting their internships or job offers, such as by moving them online, postponing start dates or shortening contracts.  Anubha Gupta, a first-year design media arts student, was happily surprised when she heard that her summer internship at Warner Bros. Entertainment would be online.  I knew that (COVID-19) would be impacting my summer somehow, but I was surprised that they would still be conducting the internship remotely, she said. A lot of studios have just cut their interns completely, so Im really lucky.  Gupta started interning at Warner Bros. last summer as part of a four-year internship program offered by the company. She works on a different animated show each year in the program. Last summer, Gupta helped with producing ""Young Justice,"" a DC Comics cartoon.  Still, Gupta said she struggled with her internships transition online.  She was provided minimal information on how her internship would operate because of the unprecedented situation, Gupta said. Her biggest worry, however, is not having technology that she would have if her internship was at the studios, she said.  It's all software that I'm not familiar with ... (and) my boss would normally be there to tell me how to work around things, Gupta said. I won't have that physical being to tell me how things work.  Gupta also struggled with canceling the Airbnb she rented near the studio for her internship.  It was unnecessarily hard, Gupta said. It was a good few days of just contacting them back and forth and saying that I needed my money back, but they ended up giving it back.  Some students are looking for other things to do in anticipation of suspended summer jobs.  Kailey Fleiszig-Evans, a first-year mathematics student, planned on working her fourth year as a counselor at UC Berkeleys Blue Camp and Social Skills Youth Camp. The camp aims to boost childrens developmental skills.  Fleiszig-Evans reapplied to the program in March, hoping the camp would continue in spite of the coronavirus pandemic. She said she clears her schedule each summer to reunite with a group of kids she connected with in her time working at the camp.  The camp did not announce it would be canceled, but Fleiszig-Evans has started planning for other ways to fill her summer in case it is suspended, such as taking online classes at UCLA.  Ive been expecting that its not going to happen, (so) Ive been mentally preparing myself, Fleiszig-Evans said.  Hassan Akmal, the UCLA Career Center's executive director, said that the center is still offering its usual services over Zoom.  Carina Salazar, the associate director of career education &amp; engagement at the UCLA Career Center, said the center is helping students by encouraging them to meet with counselors and posting content on their website such as a guide to finding remote learning resources to help students during this time.  The Career Center is also hosting virtual career fairs, surveying seniors for their post-graduation plans and has conducted the aforementioned survey on hiring trends during the pandemic.  Dang has been using this time to participate in case competitions where teams compete to find creative solutions to various problems.  For one of the case competitions he participated in, Dang and his group had to develop a product for communities impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. His team created an idea for an app to provide information on clubs and organizations at UCLA for first-year and transfer students.  Dang said he has built a great academic and professional network which has made this time easier.  They've been a huge support system so it hasn't been too bad overall, Dang said.  &nbsp;","['cap-kaitlin-browne', 'cap-bobby-hekel']",['a-closer-look'],https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.news_.summercareerplans.CK_.jpg
259,/2020/04/16/nursing-clinical-practices-allowed-to-be-online-because-of-limits-from-pandemic/,397.0,374.0,258,311.0,0.9196,0.8514,$0.00,Nursing clinical practices allowed to be online because of limits from pandemic,https://dailybruin.com/2020/04/16/nursing-clinical-practices-allowed-to-be-online-because-of-limits-from-pandemic/,"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:23:41 +0000",Camayak_ab7cf4e1ca," Last week, students from the UCLA School of Nursing had their first online simulation classes. Students spent 12 hours on computers performing a series of tasks on simulated patients under direction of the faculty, replacing in-person learning.  In order to get a degree in nursing, students have to spend a certain number of hours in clinical practice assessing patients in a hospital setting. UCLA nursing students have in-person clinicals spring quarter of their third and fourth years of the nursing program. The California Board of Registered Nursing requires 75% of those hours be done with in-person, direct patient care in order to qualify for a nursing license. The other 25% percent can be done online. These percentages differ by state.  Linda Sarna, dean of the UCLA School of Nursing, said that the COVID-19 outbreak made it challenging to place nursing students in some hospitals.  Many hospitals barely have enough personal protective equipment for their own staff, Sarna said. Additionally, students may be asymptomatic carriers and affect patients in the hospital.  Because of these challenges, Sarna said the nursing program was putting a pause on placing students in the clinical setting. She said hospitals have also asked the program to delay sending students.  &#8220;It has been a struggle, because at times we thought we had a clinical placement set up, and the next day the rules changed and the spots changed,&#8221; Sarna said.  Nicole Claveria, a fifth-year nursing student, said while it is scary to be in a hospital because there have been so many COVID-19 cases, she still wants to work and help in light of the shortage of health care workers.  &#8220;For us (fourth-years in the program), we are a little in the dark for what is going on,&#8221; Claveria said. &#8220;All our nursing faculty, they are working extremely hard. They are working hard to get our hours in because they want us to graduate in time.&#8221;  Nursing students recently received an email saying they could start going to the hospital for their clinicals starting April 20, Claveria said.  The spread of COVID-19 has also disrupted the plans of nursing students who had been placed in hospitals already with placements for clinical rotations. Amy Tuey, a fourth-year nursing student, said her placement at Torrance Memorial Medical Center changed within a matter of hours.  &#8220;Monday, I had a meeting with my medical instructor and they said Torrance was still on,&#8221; Tuey said. &#8220;A few hours, later (the) Torrance hospital officially said they aren't taking nursing students at this time in order to leave more spots open for new hires.&#8221;  On March 4, the California Board of Registered Nursing announced that 50%  of the hours required in a nursing program could be done online through simulation or lab training.  Mary Ann Shinnick, director of simulation at the UCLA School of Nursing, said that they had been preparing in the case that the board decided to increase the number of simulation hours allowed. Shinnick said they had been looking for products to introduce to the program over spring break.  The School of Nursing is assisting students who do not have laptops and professors who do not have webcams, Shinnick said. Additionally, she said the training software is provided for free for nursing students.  Nicole Durghalli, a fourth-year nursing student, had her first simulated 12-hour rotation shift last Tuesday, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.  Durghalli said she was nervous because simulation programs often ask for very specific answers.  &#8220;If you put .4 instead of 0.4, you may be marked wrong,&#8221; Durghalli said. &#8220;That&#8217;s definitely a concern of mine, getting it wrong not because I did it incorrectly but because they didn't like the way I wrote my answer.&#8221;  Durghalli said that while she understood it was risky for nursing students to go to hospitals, she felt a bit cheated by the experience.  Durghalli said risking her life treating patients would be something she would be doing as part of her job had she already graduated.  &#8220;Quite frankly I don&#8217;t want to spend 12 hours on my computer,&#8221; Drughalli said. &#8220;I want to do what I love best, which is taking care of patients.&#8221;  After her first clinical rotation, she said that the other nursing students and herself felt tired after seven to eight hours.  While they were exhausted during their shift, Durghalli said the online clinicals led to in-depth conversation about diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Durghalli added that because they were online with the faculty they had time to discuss the side effects of the 19 medications you can prescribe for COPD. If they were in a hospital setting, this might not have been possible, Durghalli said.  Members of the nursing cohort group chat supported each other throughout the entire shift, sending each other memes for encouragement, she added.  Sarna said they have created an independent study course that looks at the pandemic and pandemics throughout history. Although the course was created for graduate students, undergraduate students would also be able to join the course with faculty approval, Sarna added.  Sarna said COVID-19 allows students to understand how to prepare for pandemics by learning about supply chains for respirators, public health strategies and the identification of demographics who are at risk.  &#8220;Here we are in a new pandemic,&#8221; Sarna said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think any of us would have imagined that we would be experiencing this.&#8221; ",[],"['campus', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/melanomapic.jpg

But for   the  600 to 700  undocumented students at UCLA, there is another worry they must add to this list  their futures in the United States.  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or  DACA , is an executive order established by former President Barack Obama in 2012. It defers any   prosecutorial   action against immigrants who came to the United States as children and meet a set of requirements, such as continuous residence in the United States and lack of any felony or serious misdemeanor convictions. Individuals who qualify for DACA protection can also receive authorization to work in the United States.  Though DACA fails to address all of the challenges undocumented college students face in the U.S., it certainly helps alleviate the pressure of deportation from a country that many undocumented students have come to call home.  In 2017, the Trump administration  announced plans to terminate DACA .   The Supreme Court stepped in to determine the constitutionality of this action   after several lawsuit challenges were brought against the termination, including  one from the UC Board of Regents.  A decision from the court is expected in June  but with a conservative majority in the court, DACA protections may very well be under threat.  Regardless of the court's ruling, all students admitted to the University of California should be given the same opportunity to focus on their studies, regardless of their immigration status.   If the UC Regents are truly committed to providing an equitable education to undocumented students, they must bolster resources for these students by naming   each of the UCs as   sanctuary campuses.   This gives the 10 universities the power to adopt policies that provide better on-campus resources   and safe spaces for their undocumented students.  Because at the moment, the UCs aren't doing enough.  Undocumented students must grapple with daily   worries over their and their families' immigration status.   Rampant discrimination and anti-immigrant sentiment exacerbates   these   feelings of instability.  There have been many hate threats and crimes against immigrants in the United States, particularly immigrants of color, said   Ernesto Arciniega, a PhD student in Hispanic literatures and founder of the Hispanic Latinx Graduate Students Association.  With all of these concerns weighing on students   minds, legislative threats from the Trump administration only add to the uncertainty.  For one, without the protections afforded by the executive order, undocumented students could face deportation in the near future.  Financial status also puts undocumented students in an alarmingly   precarious position. In addition to the threat of deportation, the removal of DACA protections will mean   they no longer have authorization to work in the United States.  Alondra Avalos, a second-year sociology and labor studies student and member of the Student Labor Advocacy Project of UCLA, said these uncertainties interfere with undocumented students educational pursuits.  At the end of the day, when youre undocumented, I dont think youre a student first above anything because you have that worry that youre not going to be able to finish your education anyway, Avalos said.  The instability that comes along with being undocumented only adds to the stress of higher education and undoubtedly affects students' academic performance. It is the UCs responsibility to help ease this stress and provide a quality education   to all of its students, regardless of their immigration status.  As significant contributors to their respective campus communities, undocumented students deserve the most basic protection measures from administrative officials.  I think that will be a terrible decision, a bad decision from the Supreme Court, and especially for a community of students who are contributing so much to their campuses, to the UC system, to the state of California, to the world, Arciniega said.  Given, the UC does afford some protections for undocumented students.  For example, UCLA offers resources for undocumented students, such as case management office hours with the Undocumented Student Program. These resources have expanded since threats to undocumented students status have increased.  The University's Office of Campus Counsel has also developed a  reference guide  to help students respond to federal immigration officers on campus.  This guide is designed to help frontline faculty and staff in the event that an immigration official seeks to enter a campus limited-access space, such as a classroom or department office, for enforcement purposes,"" said senior executive director of UCLA media relations Tod Tamberg in an emailed statement.  But, none of these measures come close to providing students the support they need and deserve. Even the resources that UCLA does offer could be more accessible than they currently are. For example, Avalos said that putting the phone numbers UCLA has available to report ICE or DHS officers on the back of ID cards would improve awareness of these resources.  As the Supreme Court's decision over DACAs fate looms nearer, the University of California must officially declare its campuses as sanctuary campuses in order to systematically strengthen protection for undocumented students.  Because at the end of the day, not all undocumented students enjoy the protections of DACA.  The President of the UC's  website  states that the University of California sets a gold standard for its students that must be upheld.  But as long as undocumented students must worry about their immigration status before their academics, the UC is neglecting this proclaimed gold standard of education.",['cap-sophia-kloster'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/op.kloster.DACAstudentsafety.png

At that time, the only Bruin gymnast with an account was senior Mercedez Sanchez.  ""We would all watch her videos, but none of us really got into it,"" Hano said. ""Then TikTok blew up, so (Sanchez) started wanting to make TikToks again, so I said, 'You know what, I&#8217;m just going to get it and see what it&#8217;s all about.' And we&#8217;re all obsessed with it now.""  Now, as the app passes two billion downloads worldwide, UCLA gymnastics has joined the now increasingly popular video platform. The team started making dance and gymnastics videos together on an official UCLA account back in February.  But now that the gymnasts have returned to their homes because of lockdown restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the app has become a way for the team to stay in touch, collaborating on TikToks or sharing their favorites with each other.  ""I think everyone on our team has a TikTok now. Even if they don&#8217;t make videos, we just send each other different videos that are funny, or we&#8217;ll send them in the group chat,"" Hano said. ""Then whenever we call each other we talk about them, ... it&#8217;s a really good way to keep us all connected.""  In addition to being able to keep the team connected during quarantine, sophomore Margzetta Frazier said the gymnastics team has also used the app to correspond with the wider community of UCLA athletes, which is very close despite them not playing on the same team.  One of Frazier's best friends is UCLA men's water polo junior attacker Nicolas Saveljic, and she said TikTok has allowed them to continue to interact and have fun, even though they are separated by an ocean.   ""(Saveljic), who&#8217;s international right now, he can be on the  app, and we make videos together. He&#8217;s all the way in Montenegro and I&#8217;m  in New Jersey, and we&#8217;re making videos together,"" Frazier said. ""We&#8217;re always texting each other, and we&#8217;re saying 'Can we be in this video, can we do this challenge,' so it&#8217;s pretty organic how we get together and come up with ideas.""   In fact, one of the biggest viral videos coming from a UCLA gymnast features an athlete from another sport. Hano's most popular video features her boyfriend, UCLA men's basketball redshirt senior forward Alex Olesinski, and pokes fun at the issues that come with his 6-foot-10 frame. The TikTok currently has more than 1.3 million views.  ""I did (it) with my boyfriend, who&#8217;s also a basketball player at UCLA, and we made that video in just five minutes while joking around, and then I posted it, ... and the next day it blew up,"" Hano said. ""Honestly, the ones that I don&#8217;t really put much effort into, or don&#8217;t think too much about, are the ones that do really, really well.""  Junior Savannah Kooyman agreed that often the videos that require the least effort and planning end up the most popular, as they can almost never predict what their followers will like or what will go viral.   ""I honestly have no idea, because sometimes I&#8217;ll post something and think people are really going to like it, and it won&#8217;t get that many views, and then some take me one minute to film, and then people like it, so I have no idea what the formula is,"" Kooyman said.   While TikTok has been a great way for the team to stay connected with their friends, Frazier said she also likes being able to use the platform to connect with the team's fans. The sophomore uses behind-the-scenes videos and commentary to give Bruin audiences insight into the lives of their favorite gymnasts both during quarantine and during the season.   ""I did this series of videos about what really goes on in my head during routines, and people just ate it up, again millions of views on it,"" Frazier said. ""(I just like) shedding some light on the sport of gymnastics and showing that it&#8217;s not all glitz and glam and perfect 10s, but it can still be funny and light-hearted.""  At the same time, Frazier said the app has become more than just a platform for silly videos, even if she enjoys making those as well. The gymnast has observed how the app can be used to spread important information on the coronavirus pandemic and other world issues, while also reminding people that they're not alone, even if they're stuck in their house.   ""The thing with TikTok is, at first it may seem like a bunch of humor, but there&#8217;s a lot of accounts that really spread awareness on the world situation and ... to me it doesn&#8217;t feel like a distraction, it really feels like a connection, because anyone in the world can get the app,"" Frazier said. ""It feels like it&#8217;s a way to know there&#8217;s light at the end of this tunnel, and it doesn&#8217;t have to be miserable.""

Robert Faturechi won the award alongside fellow ProPublica reporters   T.   Christian Miller and Megan Rose   for their coverage of two   accidents that occured in the Navys 7th fleet in 2017.    The team published a    series of articles    called Disaster in the Pacific, in which they investigated two deadly   collisions between the USS Fitzgerald and the   USS John S. McCain with cargo vessels and detailed the infrastructural and technological   mishaps that caused it.    Faturechi wrote for the Daily Bruin from 2004 to 2008, notably uncovering    preferential treatment    in the UCLA School of Dentistry admissions, for which he was honored with a    Sunshine Award    by the Society for Professional Journalists in 2008.   He was also the editor for Enterprise, the Bruins long-term investigative section,   from 2007 to 2008.    The Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting was also awarded to writers at The Seattle Times for their coverage of design flaws in Boeings 737 MAX airplanes.    The 2020 Pulitzer Prizes, which are typically announced at Columbia University, were instead announced on YouTube because of the coronavirus pandemic.    Each year the   Pulitzer Prize Board issues awards in 22 categories. The award is widely considered to be the most prestigious honor in journalism. The New York Times won the most prizes, winning in the categories of Investigative Reporting, International Reporting and Commentary.    The last time a Daily Bruin alumnus won the award was in 2017.

Morris, a third-year global studies student, joined the Daily Bruin as a reporter for campus politics during her first year at UCLA in 2017. She became the assistant news editor for campus politics the following year, then the assistant editor of Enterprise, The Bruins investigative section, in 2019.    Morris was the sole candidate for editor in chief this year. She was endorsed by the Daily Bruin staff in a hearing Friday night and appointed at a board meeting Monday.    Morris will take over the newspaper while production of the print paper and in-person meetings have temporarily halted due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.    Shell face hiring and training an entirely new staff of editors remotely, managing an uncertain financial situation and steering the coverage of a student newspaper when    student life has mostly     ground to a halt   .    But shell be up to the task, said Angie Forburger, the Daily Bruin 2019-2020 editor in chief and a fourth-year communication student.    She's motivated and willing to put forth whatever she needs to to get the job done, and also just (has) phenomenal news experience and news judgment, Forburger said.    Although the situation at The Bruin is in flux after the start of a global pandemic, Morris said she isnt concerned.    I know that our staff is incredibly dedicated, so they're going to make it work, Morris said.    One of Morris primary aims for the upcoming year is to help increase the diversity of the Daily Bruin newsroom. She hopes to accredit the Daily Bruin as an academic class, establish scholarships for low-income student journalists and create a Daily Bruin outreach chair.    It's not fair to ask people to choose between an unpaid internship, or a barely paid internship, and a job that can actually help you with your day-to-day expenses, Morris said.    She also wants to innovate to increase efficiency within the newspaper.    Hedy Wang, the 2019-2020 Enterprise editor and a fourth-year communication and economics student, said that in addition to her work ethic and news judgment, Morris cares genuinely for others and is always willing to go the extra mile to help her colleagues.    Wang has been Morris editor for the past two years, first as the News editor in 2018-2019 before working with her this year in Enterprise. She said Morris has been one of the best campus politics editors she has seen in her time at the Daily Bruin.    I think everyone who's worked with her  whether it's her writers, or her co-assistants  everyone who's seen those abilities in her has probably been inspired to carry that on in their own work, Wang said.    Morris hadnt been interested in pursuing journalism until she started at the Daily Bruin. In high school, she participated in the marching band and the Constitution Club, in which students participated in policy research and debate.    She has the ability to see things from a completely different perspective, said Megan Leahy, Morris government teacher and coach of the Constitution Club. She can challenge people without being over-imposing and (is an) incredibly hard worker, thoughtful and strong-willed and independent, a dream for any teacher to have.    Morris has been writing since she was young, said Emily Morris, Melissa Morris sister.    Melissa Morris had already learned how to read and write by the time she was in preschool, said Kristine Iwashita-Morris, Morris mother and a second-grade teacher. In preschool, Morris decided to write a report on the animals of Australia, which she presented to her class, taking questions from the audience, Iwashita-Morris said.    I guess that was her first official article that shes written, she said.    Morris parents, both UCLA alumni, read the Daily Bruin every day while commuting to campus as students. Iwashita-Morris said because of that, they were excited when they heard shed joined the newspaper staff.    Her dad and I are so proud of her, Iwashita-Morris said. Shes always been a very caring person, and thats something that I think were most proud of.    Morris said she decided to run for editor in chief when she began thinking about some of the things the newspaper could be doing better.    I realized that if I actually wanted to do it, especially because I'm going to be a fourth-year and this is my last chance, I might as well go big, Morris said.    No matter what happens moving forward, the Daily Bruin will get through it, Morris said.    We're providing a service to people, Morris said. And maybe that service has changed because we're focused more on the pandemic than whatever given campus event is going on. But at the end of the day, our job is just to help people, and we're going to be trying to do that.

It&#8217;s an ongoing, rumor-fuelled joke for American college students: If you get hit by a vehicle on campus, you will get your tuition paid.   This running bit became a reality for University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, student and Twitter user Miranda Sun, who went viral for  sharing an image  of herself at the hospital after having been hit by a bus on her college campus.  &#8220;Yesterday, I finally achieved what every single college student in America has dreamed of, yet can only hope will happen to them,"" Sun wrote on Twitter. ""That&#8217;s right. I got run over by a bus on campus.""  The tweet has garnered more than 68,000 retweets, almost 378,000 likes and thousands of comments since it was posted around seven months ago.  One of the most liked comments on the viral post teases at how relatable Sun&#8217;s sentiment is for college students.   &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re okay, but also congrats,"" the user wrote in response to the tweet. ""That is really an accomplishment. I tried for years to no avail.""  The ongoing quip is one of many offshoots of the same idea: Young people, particularly college students, making jokes about mental health and dying.   At first glance, these jokes seem concerning, however, in some ways, they may actually provide a commiserating platform to a generation more stressed than ever.  First-year economics student Nima Ashrafi mentioned he tends to hear these jokes daily.  &#8220;Every time I walk down Bruin Walk, I hear people express their lack of patience for the (De Neve) stoplight by saying that they would be OK with a car hitting them,"" Ashrafi said.  Ashrafi   added that when he first came to UCLA, he was surprised by how often his peers would express themselves in such dark ways. Now in his second quarter, he   said he has grown numb to the dark remarks.  Not only have these jokes become more prevalent on campus, but they have also become prevalant on the internet and within meme culture.   Popular social media accounts, such as the UCLA meme page on Facebook, often make light of the difficulties college students face. Many jokes point to the stressors of college life: the impossibility of balancing heavy course loads with career preparation and a social life, all while maintaining a high GPA and getting eight hours of sleep per night.   One  popular Instagram post , circulated by a highly followed college meme page, proclaims death as an escape to the burden of student loan debt.  Other memes go further into the negative impact college stressors can have on students, describing mental breakdowns, episodes of depression and suicidal thoughts.  A meme posted on Tumblr with more than 3,000 notes discusses one's ongoing experience with suicidal thoughts. Paired with an image of a cartoon character sleeping, the caption reads: ""Me going to sleep at 3 am knowing my suicidal thoughts are getting progressively worse and I'm doing nothing to stop them.""  Deprecative jokes tend to come to life in stressful classroom settings.   During times of high pressure, such as midterm and final exam weeks, Ashrafi said he tends to hear students joke not only about their mental health, but also about how they would rather kill themselves than take their exam.  While the dark humor may manage to get laughs in the real world and likes online, the trend is disturbing alongside what  news sources have called a campus mental health ""epidemic.""   [caption caption=""College students across the U.S. often face a plethora of academic, professional and personal stress, and studies have shown many students experience mental illnesses as a result. (Edward Qiao/Daily Bruin senior staff)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_377265"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   A 2018  study  from the American College Health Association found that 41.9% of participating students said they felt so depressed that it was difficult to function at some point in the previous year. The same study found that 63.4% of college students had felt overwhelming anxiety in the last year.  Left untreated, mental health issues can lead to serious consequences.  The  ACHA reports  that suicide rates among teens and college-aged youth have tripled since the 1950s. In addition, the World Health Organization has  listed suicide  as the second-leading cause of death for youth aged 15-29 worldwide.  For some students, including third-year atmospheric and oceanic studies student Melinda Berman, the jokes have become a part of college culture.  &#8220;I definitely think those jokes are a lot more normalized now,&#8221; Berman said. &#8220;Because it doesn&#8217;t really scare me to hear stuff like that.&#8221;  Chloe Rosenstock, a first-year psychology student and peer counselor at Peer Assistance and Wellness Support at UCLA, believes college students' comedic and open approach to mental health may actually be therapeutic.  &#8220;I think it&#8217;s used as a coping mechanism to make situations seem less serious and volatile,&#8221; Rosenstock said.  Psychologists have long known  humor to improve overall well-being  and to be a natural way to reduce and relieve stress. Thus, it&#8217;s possible these dark jokes help students practice stress relief and even perhaps form a community over shared hardships.  UCLA adjunct assistant professor in psychiatry Alexander Korb describes the effects of humor on well-being.  &#8220;Humor has always been around as a coping mechanism,&#8221; Korb said. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more productive to laugh about something than just be completely overwhelmed by it.&#8221;  However, no one coping mechanism is always beneficial.  ""(Joking about mental health) is enough to keep (people) from feeling worse, but it doesn't actually compel them to take action to solve the problem"" Korb said.  While memes and quips may help individuals express themselves and feel heard, Korb adds, they can also normalize suicidal thoughts and emotional struggles instead of destigmatizing them.  Overexposure to these jokes may persuade individuals that their struggles are commonplace enough to not warrant professional help, Korb said. Inversely, the same jokes may also motivate an individual to seek support or reach out.   For now, mental health jokes may be becoming more prevalant not only in real life, but also online.  UCLA continuing lecturer in communication and licensed psychologist Dee Bridgewater said a comedic approach to mental health may be deconstructive to those who are on the receiving end of the joke.  Not only can this humor trivialize affected individuals, Bridgewater adds, but it also can make it difficult to distinguish a joke from a cry for help.  College campuses have introduced initiatives to bolster student well-being   and   work to catch up with a  rising number  of college students who are reporting having anxiety and depression.  UCLA launched the  Depression Grand Challenge  in 2012, which uses a peer-to-peer network to connect students with graduate students trained in emotional support and clinical psychology. In addition, the university offers resources such as clinical help from Counseling and Psychological Services and peer-to-peer support groups such as  Wazo Connect , for students experiencing mental health issues.  Yet, students continue to experience the struggles of college life day in and day out. On some days, the stress may be overwhelming and students may find themselves laughing at a dark joke and bonding over their plight. All jokes aside, it's important to think critically about what this humor is communicating.  At the end of the day, we don't want people to be hurt by moving vehicles, comedic or otherwise.

But   for students of Middle Eastern and North African descent, those lines dictating diversity are blurred.  UCLA&#8217;s Middle Eastern Student Association and Lebanese Student Association held an  event  March 4 to discuss the representation of Middle Eastern and North African identities on the 2020 census. The United States Census Bureau  defines  white people as individuals who have origins in Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, but lacks a separate ethnic category for those who are Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA.  The absence of a racial or ethnic category that represents people of MENA descent symbolizes their invisibility and marginalization in the U.S.  Unfortunately, even this forward-thinking university contributes to that erasure.     According to the Arab American Institute, there could be upward of 3.5 million Arab Americans in the U.S. However, this population is entirely absent from the data shared by UCLA.   Efforts to make MENA students feel more included and represented must begin with undergraduate admissions. Specifically, the  undergraduate profile  on the UCLA Undergraduate Admissions page should include a Middle Eastern/North African or Southwest Asian/North African category. UCLA has a responsibility to these students, and it must push for transparency and newly defined racial categories as a first step in channeling institutional and community resources toward these groups.   The census is critical for political representation, the allocation of university   funds and resources to communities and the assessment of racial health disparities. MENA communities are referred to as &#8220;hard-to-count&#8221; by the census, leaving them   more vulnerable to unequal political representation and access to public and private resources for underrepresented communities.   Like Hispanic individuals, Middle Eastern and North African individuals come from racially diverse backgrounds and classifying the entire group as white neutralizes their identities &#8211; while leaving the door wide open for daily microaggressions.   Jasmine Hanna, a fourth-year sociology student and president of the Middle Eastern Student Association, said she feels like she doesn&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a specific statistic on how many MENA students there are because they are not all unified under a certain body.  ""Providing the option for North African/Southwest Asian representation on forms and documents is one step to see what kind of resources we need and the allocation of resources and funding to our communities,"" Hanna said.   In the time after 9/11, MENA groups have increasingly faced housing and employment discrimination, stereotyping and racial profiling. These sociopolitical stressors make MENA individuals more vulnerable to mental health problems, especially  anxiety and depression .   And without numbers to guide any funding, mental health services for MENA groups are dismal.  Michelle Kidess, a second-year international development studies student, said every MENA person looks different, and one can&#8217;t assume they know where someone is from.  ""Whenever I look at applications, I can never find myself, in jobs or anything that I'm in,"" Kidess said. ""It's always that people are kind of playing the guessing game.""  Because individuals of MENA descent continually experience invisibility, it is time for UCLA to make MENA students feel welcome and seen. And the first step to acknowledging their existence is to bring their data to the forefront. The University of California system has a comprehensive  breakdown  of fall enrollment by race/ethnicity. While this data is available for anyone to view, it is difficult to find.  While the UC system does include a Southwest Asian and North African broad category in its disaggregated race/ethnicity demographic page, UCLA chooses not to use it. The  student enrollment demographics  published on the UCLA Equity, Diversity and Inclusion website utilize the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System from the U.S. Department of Education to survey race in enrollment.  But when there are no boxes MENA students can fit into, the doors close for funding and administrative support.       Student groups on campus can request funding through EDI Funding Requests. But without the data, MENA students are not recognized as a diverse group and may not fit into the values of the EDI funding initiative, making them unable to fairly receive funding.  Better access to those figures is only a first step in supporting MENA students at UCLA. A freshman and transfer yield event, also known as an admit weekend, should be created for Middle Eastern and North African students. Those programs are aimed to create a unified community between admits and current students and to connect admits to campus resources.    UCLA should also   gear efforts toward making accessible and available prayer spaces, making dietary accommodations, providing mental health resources specifically catered toward MENA students and more.   ""In terms of support, I don't think there's anything that specifically targets North African and Middle Eastern students,"" said Kareem Ahmed, a fourth-year neuroscience student and member of the Muslim Student Association. ""I think it's difficult to find (a) community.""   Ultimately, UCLA can't serve MENA students with access to funding and support systems if it doesn't even know how many are out there.  Of course, some individuals of Middle Eastern or North African descent may argue that identifying as white is the most accurate representation of themselves. But   creating a separate MENA category is not intended to force people to identify with a group that doesn&#8217;t accurately represent their identities. It is instead intended to provide more options for people to better   identify themselves.  Including a separate MENA category for the 2030 census and UCLA's   demographic survey   will allow for greater political representation and better allocation of funds and resources, as well as lessen the opportunities for misrepresentation of racial and ethnic backgrounds.  Until then, another decade will pass and millions of students of color will be left unrecognized.

Of USAC&#8217;s nearly $9 million in annual student fees, $2,710,592 go to the Campus Retention Committee and the Student Initiated Outreach Committee, which serve students from underserved communities through outreach efforts. USAC requested detailed budget reports from these committees in November, but neither submitted any records to the council in the following months.  USAC voted Tuesday &#8211; five months after its initial request &#8211; to withhold future checks for the 2020-2021 academic year amounting to around $800,000, said Roy Champawat, director of the Student Union. He added that the checks for the 2019-2020 academic year were already distributed, so the temporary absence of future checks will not affect any current projects.  CRC and SIOC sent USAC budget reports Thursday, but they were too vague, said USAC General Representative 1 Eduardo Velazquez, who previously served on CRC.  &#8220;It was not a complete breakdown,&#8221; Velazquez said. &#8220;What they gave us was broken down by line items without going into the specifics.&#8221;  He added that USAC will continue to withhold checks until it receives a more satisfactory report.  &#8220;We truly believe that students should be able to know where their student fees are going, which is why we made this decision,&#8221; said USAC Internal Vice President Kimberly Bonifacio, who was previously a member of Samahang Pilipino Education and Retention, one of CRC's six projects. &#8220;We will only send these checks to the committees if we can see clearly what those budget reports look like and what they plan to do with the money.&#8221;  As past student members of CRC, both Velazquez and Bonifacio said that they were not given access to budgetary information.  &#8220;We would not see the budget in full,&#8221; Bonifacio said. &#8220;We would be given a partial budget to allocate to our retention projects. We also could not see how much money was in the discretionary funds.&#8221;  After funds are allocated from USAC to CRC and SIOC, they are sent to an outside accounting group. Once the funds actually make it to CRC and SIOC, they are managed by the administration in the Community Programs Office, which houses committees such as CRC and SIOC, Champawat said.  Velazquez said that students in CPO are not at fault for the absence of records.  &#8220;Certain students have definitely yelled at council for asking for the budget reports because they feel as if council is questioning the department that helps out students of color,&#8221; Velazquez said. &#8220;I'm also a student of color, and my community is being helped by these access and retention projects. But then, that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t get to be critical of what the department is doing.&#8221;  Antonio Sandoval, CPO director, did not respond to a request for a comment.  Mother Organizations housed within CPO, including the Afrikan Student Union, MEChA de UCLA and more, sent a letter in early March to the CPO administration in support of the requests made by USAC.  Velazquez said serving on USAC has changed his perspective on CRC&#8217;s finances. USAC members are given access to the council&#8217;s comprehensive budget, Velazquez said. He added that if they have questions on allocations, they can communicate directly with the parties and remain transparent.  &#8220;But then, sitting on the CRC, that was never fully present to us. I think that is definitely a cause for concern,&#8221; he said.

The NCAAs Division I Council voted to allow schools to grant an extra year of eligibility to certain student-athletes whose seasons were affected by COVID-19 on Monday. The new policy only applies to student-athletes who play spring sports, however, as winter-sport athletes were not given extra eligibility.    UCLA will have 11 teams impacted by the motion  baseball, softball, mens volleyball, beach volleyball, womens water polo, mens and womens tennis, mens and womens golf, rowing and outdoor track and field. UCLA mens basketball, womens basketball, gymnastics and the other winter sports teams that call Westwood home will not be able to award extra eligibility to their players despite having unfinished seasons, so seniors such as Kyla Ross and Prince Ali have officially made their final appearances in blue and gold.    The council also adjusted financial aid rules in order to give schools the flexibility to extend more scholarship offers to returning seniors and incoming freshmen. The decision by the council does not mean these athletes fates are set in stone, however.    The NCAA is leaving individual financial decisions up to the schools and athletic departments and is not requiring them to give returning student-athletes scholarships equal in amount to their 2019-2020 aid.    Schools that would like to offer more scholarships than the regularly allocated amount are permitted to utilize the NCAAs Student Assistance Fund for the 2020-2021 academic year.    The Councils decision gives individual schools the flexibility to make decisions at a campus level, said council chair M. Grace Calhoun in a written statement. The Board of Governors encouraged conferences and schools to take action in the best interest of student-athletes and their communities, and now schools have the opportunity to do that.    Seniors who were in their final year of collegiate eligibility will not count against roster caps in baseball, which is the only spring sport that typically has that restriction.

Vu said the encounter felt offensive as it implies he is contagious or threatening because of his Asian heritage.  Over the past few months accounts of racist acts toward and attacks against Asian Americans have increased, according to  NBC News . On March 19, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, a Los Angeles-based advocacy group, launched STOP AAPI HATE, a reporting center for reporting discrimination against Asian Americans.  Within the first two weeks of opening, the reporting center received more than 1,100 reports of discrimination toward Asian Americans, which has been attributed to COVID-19 and its racialization, according to the council.  On March 16, President Donald Trump  tweeted , &#8220;The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.&#8221;  Min Zhou, an Asian American studies and sociology professor, said the usage of phrases like &#8220;Chinese Virus&#8221; makes it seem as if the virus is innately Chinese, which prescribes blame to the Chinese and can invoke anti-Chinese and broader anti-Asian sentiment, Zhou added.  Natalie Masuoka, an associate professor of political science and Asian American studies, said many people rely on politicians to learn about current issues, however a 280-character tweet discourages people to view the coronavirus in a nuanced way.  &#8220;Most of us really don&#8217;t have the time to deeply study any given issue,&#8221; Masuoka said. &#8220;So we rely on messages offered to us via our leaders, things they see on the media, which oftentimes aren't detailed (and are) offered in a short sound bite.&#8221;  Racialization like such is problematic because it homogenizes groups of people, Masuoka said. People might not be able to distinguish between China, the Chinese government and Chinese Americans who were born and raised in the United States, she added.  &#8220;We think about how political elites can also generate a greater ill will based on their rhetoric,&#8221; Masuoka said. &#8220;The administration&#8217;s use of 'Chinese Virus' and 'Wuhan Virus,' it would incite antipathy towards people with Asian descent.&#8221;  Racialization is often contextually driven, Masuoka said. An example of this is the model minority stereotype, which stereotypes Asian Americans&#8217; intelligence. This stereotype arose because of an expectation that certain subgroups of the population, in this case Asian Americans, will have better skills than other groups.  Masuoka added the model minority stereotype for Asian Americans is used as a political tool when it suits politicians interests.  &#8220;Different events can trigger greater reliance on the negative stereotypes that exist for Asian Americans,&#8221; she said. &#8220;(There is) this interesting duality of being the model minority and forever foreigner, persistent foreigner in the land.&#8221;  The racialization of the coronavirus may also be attributed to the political relationship between China and the United States, Zhou said. Had the virus originated in a country that was not strategic to the United States&#8217; political motives, government officials might not have prescribed blame in the same manner, Zhou added.  This political move has caused Asian Americans to be racially homogenized, despite their diverse cultural heritages, Zhou said. If anything happens to one group, such as Chinese Americans, the entire Asian American group is affected, she added.  One reason people may commit hate crimes is because they feel frustrated because of personal reasons, Zhou said.  &#8220;(Hate crime) is an easy way of venting your anger, it's a handy way, an irresponsible way,&#8221; Zhou said. &#8220;They are supported by their politicians, their organizations which make them think they are not acting on their own and they have support (for their actions).&#8221;  UCLA&#8217;s Asian Pacific Coalition is collecting narratives from students on their experiences of xenophobia in their  COVID-19 Artivism campaign .  Sharon Yuen, a fourth-year Asian American studies student and director of UCLA&#8217;s Asian Pacific Coalition, said the coalition wanted to address COVID-19 and the acts of racism toward Asian American students.  The campaign is a way to memorialize Asian American experiences and enables people to directly see these experiences without having to rely on tabloids, Yuen added.  &#8220;Sometimes when you are able to visualize and see someone has gone through a microaggression experience, then you can realize you have gone through one,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Being able to share narratives allows that type of healing.&#8221; ",['cap-tabatha-lewis'],"['a-closer-look', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/news.asianampsych.jpg

Then, I remembered that I had a few tomato seeds waiting to be planted at home. In fact, I remembered I had a whole backyard, and, well, a lot of time to try to grow my own produce.  Turns out, I'm not the first person to have this idea. In a period that feels uncertain, we   can gain some insight by looking at the past. For example, how did folks cope with lockdown and lack of supplies during wartime at other points in history? One way was through the practice of victory gardening.  James Bassett, a lecturer from UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, said that victory gardens, often known as ""liberty gardens,"" were an effort to encourage Americans to grow their own vegetables to aid the nation's food supply throughout WWI and WWII.  [caption id=""attachment_378947"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    In the March to June gardening season, leafy greens, broccoli, cabbage, chard, root veggies and hardy herbs, like thyme and sage, are popular choices among growers. (Courtesy of Matt Sheridan)[/caption]  By the mid-1940s in the United States, roughly 20 million victory gardens were established as a result of the redirection of food and transportation to the war effort as well as a national push to increase self-sufficiency.  The gardens produced about 40% of the produce consumed in-country, Bassett explained.  ""(Victory gardens) empowered people to take charge of their food supply instead of being entirely dependent on a food system that was beyond their control,"" Bassett said.  Thanks to instructional leaflets distributed nationwide, citizens were taught how to rely on their own ability to grow food.   A plethora of published victory garden pamphlets such as  ""Garden for Victory,""   ""The Victory Garden Guide""  and  ""The Victory Garden Leader's Handbook""  can still be found in online internet archives. These guides and promotions, encouraging civilians to  ""Sow the seeds of victory""  were accessible and well-received by both city-dwellers and rural communities, allowing those on the homefront to relish in the reward of producing their own food while simultaneously feeding troops overseas.  The above pamphlets' instructions remain relatively the same today. In general, though, starting small seems to be a universal ""best"" answer to how to grow your victory garden  .  &nbsp;  [caption id=""attachment_378948"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Victory gardens can come in many forms, though a backyard with some extra space is ideal for a larger garden, such as a raised 8-by-4-foot bed. (Courtesy of Matt Sheridan)[/caption]  To start constructing your own victory garden, the must-haves include nutrient-rich soil, sunlight and water.  Since we are currently in the March to June growing season, a lot of gardeners recommend growing leafy greens, broccoli, cabbage, chard, root veggies and hardy herbs, such as thyme and sage. Many of these plants can be bought at a local gardening store, hardware store or grocery store.  As we move into summer, traditional fall   produce,   such as potatoes and squash, grow best with more space and time than that of other seasons. If these big vegetables seem a little too daunting to start off with, one option is to begin  growing herbs  like cilantro, rosemary and parsley or  vegetables  like peas and onions in containers.  According to calculations from    Seedlings Gardening , the total price to start an 8-by-4-foot vegetable garden your first season is $115. All of the following seasons average around $54. Of course, this varies from garden to garden based on how you choose to customize it. Compare these figures to the average yearly spending of $259 on produce in 2016-2017, according to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics .  For those who don't have a lot of space, gardening is still accessible. Even in a cramped Westwood apartment, you can still grow herbs, sprouts and lettuce in a windowsill pot.  [caption id=""attachment_378949"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Gardening during COVID-19 quarantine measures does not require a large backyard in order to grow a handful of vegetables and herbs. Many can grow in small pots placed in areas of sunlight. (Elise Tsai/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  Of course, gardens can't replace some of the convenience items found in stores. Starting your victory garden today might not stop you from going to the grocery store tomorrow, but it can save you money and time in two weeks, two months or whenever your first produce ripens.   Plus, there is a real satisfaction in harvesting the first budding strawberry or sprig of vibrant basil and in taking back power over your food, even if it's imperfect.  Now might be just the time to consider learning something new, especially a practice that can help to make folks less reliant on some of the technologies and institutions we have come to depend on. According to Bassett, with   the increase in convenient technology and reliance on supply chains, many Americans have lost a sense of self-reliance.  Not only can growing your own produce decrease your reliance on grocery stores, but it can also provide communities with tools of resilience.  In his TED Talk "" A guerrilla gardener in South LA ,"" Ron Finley of LA Green Grounds said his gardens have become avenues for education and transformation within his community. This re-skilling that Bassett points to can be seen in the education initiatives and community programs surrounding gardening, such as The Edible Schoolyard Project or LAGG'S Teaching Garden in Los Angeles.  Finley   told the TED audience that gardening is the most defiant act one can do, particularly in historically underserved communities such as South Central LA. Gardening can demonstrate agency and resilience, as well as a reclaiming of power over food, according to Bassett.  Tierney Sheehan, a fourth-year communication student minoring in food studies, said the COVID-19 pandemic exposes a lack of resilience in our food landscapes and a lack of information regarding growing your own food.  ""Information (about) ... learning to work with the land isn't as readily available,"" Sheehan said. ""It's not integrated into popular culture.""  [caption id=""attachment_378950"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Around 20 million victory gardens were established in the United States by the mid-1940s in order to allow for resources to be directed toward the war effort. (Sakshi Joglekar/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  To shift toward a place where gardening is more integral to our lives is to begin in our homes with a simple rule: Grow what you like to eat.  ""Gardening is the simplest solution that addresses everything,"" Sheehan said, referencing gardening's overarching cross-cultural and cross-class accessibility. ""It creates equity. ... It's not an elitist trend.""  Maybe one way to advocate for ourselves and for a   struggling nation is by growing our own vegetables. In doing this, we take working with our land a step further, by integrating and normalizing it into our social culture and creating a community built upon a foundation of health and sharing, Sheehan said.     While so much has changed in the last 100 years, some of the most important things have stayed the same, Bassett said. The pleasure of satiating food and a sense of communal togetherness as you garden alongside your neighbors surmounts time and is still very much alive 100 years later.  ""Just give gardening a try,"" Bassett said. ""The scale isn't important. Start small and, well, grow from there.""",['cap-kayleigh-ruller'],"['lifestyle-quad', 'student-life', 'quad', 'westwood-quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/3-1.jpg

Stay-at-home orders have reduced road traffic, which is a major source of air pollution, said Yifang Zhu, associate director of the Center for Clean Air at the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. Burning gasoline releases volatile organic compounds, also known as VOCs, and nitrogen oxides into the air.  &#8220;This creates secondary ozone, and that is the key source for Los Angeles smog,&#8221; Zhu said.  Traffic on Los Angeles roads, especially on freeways, has decreased since mid-March, Zhu said. The reduction in emissions from transportation has reduced pollution for the past six weeks, creating the longest period of &#8220;good&#8221; air quality in over two decades,  according to CNN .  A decrease in Southern California traffic led to decreases in microscopic air pollutants known as fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5. This contributed to a 20% improvement in air quality across Southern California, according to Zhu&#8217;s findings and Environmental Protection Agency data.  Recent weather conditions, including increased rainfall during April, also improved the air quality, Zhu added. This rain has further reduced harmful chemicals in the air, making the air the cleanest it has been in decades, she said.  The &#8220;good&#8221; air quality streak has come to an end, however, as the temperature has increased in Southern California. While decreased emissions likely made a significant contribution to decreased pollution, air quality will likely continue to worsen as temperatures rise and precipitation falls in the upcoming months, according to an article published in the  Los Angeles Times .  Poor air quality has negative consequences for public health; increased concentrations of carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter in the air can lead to increases in asthma attacks and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases, said Suzanne Paulson, director of the Center for Clean Air.  Efforts to improve air quality in Los Angeles over the past few decades have decreased the amount of overall carbon in the air and improved lung capacity in children, she added.  Poor air quality can also increase the risk of dying of COVID-19, since it is a respiratory disease, Zhu said.  Jesus Araujo, director of environmental cardiology at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, said preliminary data shows that areas with more pollution have a higher COVID-19 fatality rate than areas with less pollution. In addition, air particles have been found to carry portions of the COVID-19 virus, however it isn&#8217;t known if those portions can contribute to the virus&#8217; transmission, he added.   Araujo said he recommends those with preexisting conditions try to spend time in areas with less air pollution, even after the pandemic.  Human activity is the primary cause of poor air quality, Paulson said. Although vehicles are one of the largest contributors, industrial sources, planes, ships and any type of burning that happens inside of homes can also negatively impact air quality, Paulson added.  The improved air quality resulting from stay at home orders will be quickly reversed when the pandemic ends, Zhu said. More long-term actions, such as driving less, will be necessary to improve air quality permanently.  &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t take very long for the air pollution to come back once you get gas emissions on the road again,&#8221; she said.  Zhu said she thinks society should evaluate how people can work together to improve air quality in the long term.  &#8220;We want to communicate to the public that we don&#8217;t need a pandemic to get better air,&#8221; Zhu said.

USNS Mercy left its usual home at Naval Base San Diego a day after President Donald Trump approved California Gov. Gavin Newsoms request to declare a major disaster in the state Sunday.    The Mercy, one of two hospital ships in the United States Navy, will be deployed next to the USS Iowa in the Port of Los Angeles and will assist in LAs fight against COVID-19 for the next 30 days. Its sister ship, the USNS Comfort, will arrive in New York City on Monday after finishing refitting.    (Newsom) is why we have today a ship that now will be the largest hospital in Los Angeles at its full capacity, said LA Mayor Eric Garcetti at a press conference on board the Mercy. At its capacity today, it will add a full third more available beds, and at full capacity, two-thirds more beds to the fight here at Los Angeles. ... This truly is mercy on the water.    The Mercy carries about 1,000 beds when at full capacity, but most of them are bunk beds, Newsom said. County District 4 Supervisor Janice Hahn said once the bunk beds are taken into account, the Mercy will provide about 500 immediate open beds.    The ship brings with it a full suite of medical facilities, including operating rooms, a CT scanner and a large cache of medical supplies and 800 medical personnel to use them, Hahn said.    It's a total floating hospital, Hahn said. It's sustainable. The crew will have all their own food and water. So I think they're well-stocked, which is also of help to the rest of Los Angeles.    The ship will bring patients from nearby hospitals who   have tested negative for the coronavirus, freeing inpatient rooms for COVID-19 patients. The Mercy will admit its first patient of this deployment as early as Saturday, said Rear Admiral John Gumbleton.    Private ambulance companies will pick up patients that are cleared for ambulatory movement to this facility for ongoing treatment, said Port of Los Angeles Police Chief Thomas Gazsi. It could be from virtually anywhere in LA County, as far north as Ventura County and potentially Orange County as well, perhaps some from the Inland Empire.    UCLA Health spokesperson Enrique Rivero said the university does not yet have a detailed plan for cooperating with the crew of the Mercy.    Hahn said even though the ship adds much-needed relief to the LA County health system, it is a temporary solution to a growing problem.    In Los Angeles County, our hospitals are at 90% capacity, Hahn said. Even 500 beds will help relieve our current capacity, but it really shows that this isn't enough. We probably will need to look at building pop-up hospitals or (mobile army surgical hospitals) to address this concern.    After the ship moored, the LA Department of Public Health announced five new coronavirus-related deaths in the county, bringing the total to 26. The total number of people in LA County who tested positive for COVID-19 has more than tripled in six days, reaching 1,465 confirmed cases.    The spike in COVID-19 cases has put hospitals in financial distress because they have reduced elective surgeries to meet the surge. Newsom said he hopes the $2 trillion stimulus bill approved by Trump on Friday will keep hospitals open as the fight to suppress the pandemic continues.    We believe, regardless of your status, that you have the right and we have an obligation to treat you and to take care of you, Newsom said. We'll assess those costs in real-time but our focus right now is less on economics ... (and more) on the health and safety of 40 million Californians.

However, Gallup, a third-year bioengineering student, dropped Bioengineering 167L: ""Bioengineering Laboratory"" and will take it in fall instead because she believed the new online format prevented her from getting the hands-on experience she needed to fully master the techniques.  &#8220;Watching the TAs perform the experiments is not really the same thing as actually doing them,&#8221; Gallup said. &#8220;I went to the first lecture to understand what was happening in the class, and I just felt it wasn&#8217;t going to be as beneficial as it could be.&#8221;  UCLA moved spring quarter instruction completely online on March 13 to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, challenging professors to restructure their spring quarter laboratory classes to compensate for the lack of in-person lab sessions.  Timothy Fisher, the chair of the mechanical and aerospace engineering department, planned to implement microcontrollers, or small compact circuits, into his laboratory course before classes were held online but had not put his idea into practice yet.  However, the transition to remote learning made this change necessary because students can use microcontrollers at home, unlike the measurement devices usually used in his course, he said.  Fisher, also reduced the number of labs in his class and added a microcontroller-based independent project. Teaching assistants for his class now generate mock lab data based on previous years and students perform analysis in Zoom breakout rooms during lab sessions.  The videos students watch during the required lectures that depict the experiments cannot replace the in-person lab experience, Fisher added.   &#8220;Obviously we&#8217;re never going to replace the on-campus experience because touching and seeing something in three-dimension is fundamentally different than watching someone else do it on a computer screen,&#8221; Fisher said.  Amanda Freise, a lecturer in the microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics department, teaches a two quarter long laboratory class about viruses that infect bacteria, with the first half starting in spring quarter.  Freise moved fall quarter&#8217;s content, where students analyze genomes, to spring, since students can access the necessary bioinformatics tools from their computers at home. She also adjusted the labs so students could complete them individually instead of in the usual teams of four.  Freise said she did not realize how much she relied on in-person teaching to deliver important information to students.  &#8220;We have slides and readings, ... but there were so many little sticking points or things that would need troubleshooting in class,&#8221; Freise  said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not working with everybody in person or at the same time, (so) I have to really think about what the problems could be and then incorporate them into the materials.&#8221;  Freise said the majority of her students watch the lectures live but have their audio and video off. Students are also hesitant to participate when she asks for questions or in-class discussion, she added.  &#8220;I worry that the format of the course ... may prevent (students) from feeling excited about the work,&#8221; Freise said. &#8220;If I had to guess, I think that they are not enjoying the remote learning as much as they would doing this work in a classroom.&#8221;  However, online learning allowed Fisher to increase the breadth and complexity of error analysis taught in the course because he can work directly with students during the scheduled lab sessions, he added.    &#8220;I don&#8217;t love Zoom but being able to ... just kind of pop around from breakout room to breakout room really helps,&#8221; Fisher said. &#8220;We&#8217;re able to engage with (students) in a different and ... less distracted way.&#8221;  Some students embraced the move to online learning, while others sat it out.  Aly Ung, a third-year bioengineering student, said she thinks how much students enjoy their lab courses depends on what they hoped to get out of them in the first place. Ung is currently enrolled in Bioengineering 167L.  Teaching assistants talk through laboratory procedures during lab sections and students complete post-lab assignments using provided data, Ung said. She added students are also required to analyze research articles related to the assignments.  Ung said she still enjoys the course because the research lab she works in already familiarized her with many of the protocols taught in Bioengineering 167L, allowing her to focus on gaining a deeper understanding of the techniques.  &#8220;What I&#8217;m learning now is basically hyperfocusing on what I want to learn, which is the motivations behind the experimental design,&#8221; Ung said.  Kenji Miura, a second-year chemistry and material science student, said he prefers the online version of his chemistry lab because he can focus on the science without having to perform the labs.  &#8220;I actually hate chem lab with a burning passion, so the fact that it&#8217;s not in-person is great,&#8221; Miura said. &#8220;(The labs) are just very stressful.&#8221;   Miura said he also enjoys the online lab lectures&#8217; more flexible time constraints because his professor can spend more time on the material.  He added he chose to stay in his two lab courses because dropping them would force him to graduate late.  Tejas Patel, a second-year biochemistry student, said he enjoys the flexibility of his online lab but misses the troubleshooting aspect of performing labs in person. His lab course requires students to complete virtual labs through the online application Labster.  &#8220;Because (the experiments) are in the virtual lab, I don&#8217;t think you have the opportunity to like mess up and learn where you messed up,&#8221; Patel said. &#8220;If you realize you messed up it&#8217;s a learning experience, and I think that&#8217;s very valuable for students.&#8221; ",['cap-inga-hwang'],"['academics-news', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/labs.3.jpg

""We, as a human race, need to get a grasp of it,"" the UCLA football coach said. ""Whatever we can do personally to prevent the spread, it is our responsibility to do that.""  Kelly and the rest of the UCLA staff have been working from home amid the coronavirus outbreak, which forced the Bruins to shut down their spring practices on March 12. UCLA had only completed three of its 15 planned team sessions before inclement weather suspended the March 10 practice.  The Bruins were scheduled to participate in five weeks of practice this spring and typically run another five weeks of sessions from July through August before the season. Kelly said regardless of when UCLA's 2020 schedule starts, his team will need six weeks of practice to get in shape.  ""Our coaches are monitoring our players just to make sure they're on the proper routine,"" Kelly said. ""Players are working out on their own, wherever they may be. And I would say 75 to 80% of our players &#8211; and maybe even higher &#8211; are at home right now.""  Kelly said the staff has had to work around several speed bumps in the process, such as players who don't have the living situations or technology to adequately take classes and fulfill workouts.  When UCLA does get the green light from health experts, the government and the university to resume preparations for its 2020 campaign, the next question becomes, ""Who gets to watch?""  The MLB and other leagues have already opened discussions about how to run seasons without spectators in the stands. Kelly, however, said he views that scenario as unfair to the student-athletes.  ""If it's not safe for fans to attend the games, then I don't know why it would be safe for players to participate in the games,"" Kelly said.   In a poll published by Seton Hall's Stillman School of Business on Thursday, 72% of respondents said they would not return to sporting events before a coronavirus vaccine is made widely available. The poll's sample size of 762 has drawn criticism, but 61% of the subjects who self-identified as sports fans said they wouldn't go back to stadiums either.  President Donald Trump told professional and collegiate commissioners that sports could likely resume play with full stands by August or September, but some medical experts and media members are forecasting a complete shutdown of sports for the remainder of 2020.  Kelly said he wanted to air on the side of caution, and that he took away an important lesson from his recent conversation with 84-year-old former Indiana coach and ESPN analyst, Lee Corso.  ""(Corso)'s comment to me was, ""The game of football's not more important than one person's life,'"" Kelly said. ""I think he's 100% correct and I agree with him 100%.

The board originally intended to vote on a multiyear plan for tuition increases called a cohort-based tuition model at its January meeting, but postponed the vote to its March meeting because of opposition from students over the votes short notice.  The model, which was proposed in July, would raise tuition for all incoming undergraduate students while leaving tuition fixed for returning undergraduate students. Tuition would increase for each incoming class of freshman and transfer students.  The cohort model could be adopted for up to six years, if the board approved it.  Regents Chair John Prez, UC President Janet Napolitano, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and numerous UC chancellors decided that with all the ongoing challenges due to the novel coronavirus, it would be inappropriate to move forward with the vote.  All nine undergraduate UC campuses, including UCLA, have now moved instruction online for the remainder of spring quarter or semester because of the coronavirus outbreak.  The regents meeting was held as a teleconference instead of the normal in-person meeting in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  The cohort-based tuition model was intended to provide predictability regarding tuition for students, their families and the University, Prez said. However, with all the uncertainty related to the coronavirus, the board decided that increasing tuition would not be the right course of action, he added.  Instead, Prez said the board will focus on items that will assist in navigating the challenges related to COVID-19.  Alumni Regent-designate Debby Stegura thanked the president and chair for tabling the issue.  Nobody knows what hit the economy is going to take in California or the world, Stegura said. We dont want to be in the position of being even more tenuous with our financial plans.

But since this option was  only extended to certain classes , many Bruins still face serious academic stress alongside the innumerable challenges posed by remote learning.  Pass/no pass grading allows students to earn credit for a class without receiving a letter grade. This grading option is essential during remote learning because it   allows students, who may be grappling with unprecedented adversities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, to take courses without worrying about their GPA.    But the pass/no pass option was not applied as a blanket solution across the entire university. Individual   departments still have   the power to   decide what grading   policies   best suit their courses. After all, UCLA offers a wide variety of learning experiences and a blanket solution to the intricacies of grading during       online learning was unrealistic.  Though major qualifications and GPA measurements remain stagnant during remote learning, academic and mental health struggles have  intensified  amid the pandemic. Courses that currently prohibit the pass/no pass option should still acknowledge the unprecedented situations many students find themselves in by allowing them to petition or apply for pass/no pass grading. A petition system would acknowledge variance in classes and their significance within individual departments without ignoring the pressing challenges of remote learning.  This system could certainly help students in the economics major.    Currently, all economics students are required to take prerequisite classes for a letter grade. Kathleen McGarry, professor and undergraduate vice chair of the economics department, said this is because of the competitive nature of the major.   &#8220;Some students took those classes in fall and winter, and if they didn&#8217;t get a high enough grade they might not have qualified for the major, so it didn&#8217;t seem fair to them to then let students who took the course in spring just get a pass and get into the major,""   McGarry said. &#8220;We were trying to make sure all students were treated fair because it&#8217;s so competitive to get in.&#8221;  But regardless of differing departmental dynamics, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic affect all students&#8212; lack of resources, financial instability and increased mental health challenges are just a handful of the crisis' side effects.  Adriana Galv&#225;n, psychology professor and UCLA Undergraduate Council chair, said that the decision regarding the pass/no pass policy was made in the interest of serving students.  &#8220;We decided it gave students maximum flexibility to do what&#8217;s best for them and to attain their educational goals,&#8221; Galv&#225;n said.   Now that public resources like  libraries are closed ,   many students may not have access to the technology they need to learn online. Additionally, many students and their families face  economic insecurity  as a result of the pandemic, which negatively   affects students&#8217; abilities to pay for an education.  &#8220;(Students) might be sharing computers at home and not have access to all the resources,&#8221; McGarry said. &#8220;Online testing is difficult, and students are just under a lot of stress, so we don't want to add to that when we don't have to.&#8221;  This is why a pass/no pass option should be made available in as many classes as realistically attainable, even if students must apply for it.  Randall Rojas, an economics professor who is teaching two classes with a pass/no pass option available to students this quarter, agreed the circumstances of remote learning warrant the pass/no pass grading policy.  &#8220;Given the amount of variation on the whole environment that we have, I think it's a good approach, at least in the short run,&#8221; Rojas said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a nice safety cushion right now to at least take some of that pressure away from the stress that the students already have.&#8221;   Allowing students to apply for pass/no pass grading even for classes that currently require a letter grade would increase the flexibility necessary of online learning    . Factors that should be considered in these petitions include students' financial status, accessibility to resources and   physical and mental health. Because these elements vary immensely from person to person, it only makes sense that a decision on grading takes all of these into account.  Given, the greater availability of a pass/no pass grading option may discourage students from performing at their greatest potential. Without the threat of a class impacting their GPA, students may not learn   as much as they would have had they taken the class for a letter grade.  However, there are still plenty of reasons students would choose to receive a letter grade over a pass/no pass grade given the option&#8212; GPA requirements for majors, internships, study abroad programs and more remain motivations for a student to perform at their best and receive a letter grade even during remote learning.  But while the   motivation for a letter grade remains for some   students, those who are experiencing extenuating circumstances must be given   the option to take classes for a pass/no pass grade.  The quality of education students receive has undoubtedly   declined in the age of ""Zoom University."" It is only realistic to expect the quality of student work to waver in return.  But at the end of the day, students&#8217; GPAs and mental health should not become collateral damage  .

The piece is just one part of an exhibition   taking place until Friday at the New Wight Gallery, ""MFA Exhibition No.1,"" which showcases works by   graduate students   in the UCLA Department of Art.   The three featured artists in the event, Garwood and graduate students Hailey Loman   and Jae Hwan Lim, have works on display   that utilize different media to cover subjects ranging from oral history to innovative landscape photography and art activism.   Hailey Loman: ""Autonomous Oral History Group""   Running the Los Angeles Contemporary Archive, or LACA, motivated Loman to start a new organization: the Autonomous Oral History Group, or AOHG.    An overview of the organization's accomplishments so far,   Loman said her exhibit offers a glimpse into how the AOHG operates. Loman interviews people who have dealt with   conflict or difficult ethical situations and then transcribes and uploads their stories to a database to create an oral history, she said. One part of her piece includes a conference table, which she said is a physical example of where the group's ethics board would meet to discuss how each interview went.

There will be interdisciplinary panel discussions with other UCLA departments at the table during the exhibition, and Loman said the table will serve a functional purpose at a future oral history center afterward as a place for the ethics board to meet.      &#8220;It's much more idea-driven rather than a place or event where we talk about conflicts and the conversations sort of act as these case studies,&#8221; Loman said.   [Related:    Design media arts exhibit highlights artists&#8217; interpretations of migration   ]   The exhibition will also   feature transcriptions of completed interviews and banners that   explain the mission of the AOHG, Loman said.   The banners have   work flowcharts that depict how the AOHG is organized, and   explain how its members create trust with interviewees and handle difficult ethical questions, she said.  Saida Largaespada, a UCLA alumna who works with Loman at LACA and AOHG, said the main ethical concerns of the group are ensuring that interviewees are not taken advantage of and are given   an appropriate amount of privacy. While there are consent forms that allow the AOHG to put anything from its interviews online, Largaespada said the organization will allow interviewees to retract some statements in order to maintain long-lasting relationships with them.  &#8220;Giving people a platform to speak about their experiences is really special and a lot of art does that and I think oral history can do that as well,&#8221; she said.   Ash Garwood: ""Common Fault""   The photographs in Garwood's series challenge the idea of photography as a mode of claiming and instead seek to create new spaces.   The graduate student's photo series, &#8220;Common Fault,&#8221; contains nine landscape photographs created with images of fragments of geological elements, she said. Using 3D software, she said she creates computer-generated imagery by combining the fragments to create new landscapes,   and prints the resulting images in the darkroom.

She said she wants to think more in terms of expanded photography, the idea of using imaging in new ways.   The message of her work is to allow things to change, transition and exist simultaneously through more than one presence, Garwood said.  &#8220;(The photographs) seem like landscapes and feel like things you've seen before,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And then the closer you get to the surface of them, the more that all falls apart and it feels very destabilizing ... because the space doesn't exist.&#8221;  Rodrigo Valenzuela, an assistant professor of art for   whom Garwood worked as a teaching assistant, said Garwood&#8217;s project is a result of two years of experimenting with her work, figuring out how to digitally and manually   create synthetic landscapes. She was searching for something   highly personal, but at the same time technically challenging, he said.  &#8220;(She) used this traditionally male-dominated and also very conservative idea of landscape photography, and she came up with (her own) ways to make landscapes something very beautiful,&#8221; he said.

Hwan Lim, a graduate student and co-founder of the Humans of North Korea organization,   said his three works   depict his experiences visiting North Korea and interacting with defectors from the country. The first piece,   titled &#8220;Individual Attitudes on North Korean Defectors,&#8221; is an audience survey based on a wall text   that Hwan Lim said describes two polarized South Korean perceptions of North Korean defectors. Audience members either pick one position or write down their own thoughts on the matter and then put their answers in a ballot box,   he said.

The 10-hour saga detailing the rise and fall of the Chicago Bulls' dynasty with Michael Jordan earned national praise and set Twitter ablaze every week, and it has left audiences begging for more. ESPN has a lineup of 30 for 30 documentaries set to come out over the next few weeks  including ones based around the Lance Armstrong doping scandal and the 1998 MLB home run race  but the well will run dry by late June.    UCLA, which boasts 118 NCAA titles in its 101-year history, has dozens of stories waiting to be uncovered, and the Daily Bruin Sports editors made their pitches for which ones would make the best documentary or docuseries.    ""Pyramid of Success""   Sam Connon, Sports editor   The greatest dynasty in basketball history didn't play in Chicago, New York or Boston  it played in Los Angeles.  It wasn't the Showtime Lakers, and it wasn't led by Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant  no single player defined it or stole the spotlight.  It was UCLA men's basketball under John Wooden, who coached the Bruins from 1948 to 1975 and has 10 rings and a handful of Hall of Fame alumni to show for it.  Pulling together key figures from a decades-long dynasty from almost 50 years ago would be a tall task for producers and directors to take on, especially since Wooden, guard Walt Hazzard and then-Athletics Director J.D. Morgan are all dead.  Filming a documentary series about a dead person complicates interviews, yes, but it isn't exactly uncharted waters. Think of the countless historical documentaries that come out every year about World War II, the Roman Empire and ancient Egypt, not to mention more recent sports-related docs like 2019's ""What's My Name"" about Muhammad Ali.  Making a documentary about the Wooden-era Bruins doesn't need new interviews with the Hall of Fame coach  it should focus on his legacy and how his dominance in the 1960s and 1970s has shaped the sport to this day.  That legacy extends from Wooden's famous Pyramid of Success and big man factory that produced Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton to his ties with booster Sam Gilbert and fierce rivalries with Bob Knight and Digger Phelps.  Jordan said in episode seven of ""The Last Dance"" that winning has a price, one that not everyone is willing to pay. Wooden won 10 NCAA championships over the span of 12 years and became a legend for it.  I think I speak for a lot of UCLA fans when I say I would love to see a complete, top-to-bottom breakdown of how those titles came to fruition and how they changed college basketball forever.   ""The 50-Year Dynasty""   Jack Perez, assistant Sports editor   [caption id=""attachment_380520"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Daily Bruin file photo)[/caption]  What better candidate for a 10-part documentary than a man who spent 50 years coaching one team?  Former mens volleyball coach Al Scates led the Bruins for 50 seasons, from 1963 to 2012. He amassed a record of 1,239-290, good for a .812 winning percentage.  The reason he is credited with only 19 championships is that mens volleyball did not have an NCAA title until 1970. Once the NCAA had a mens volleyball playoffs, he won the first three, six of seven and 11 of the first 15.  UCLA would go on to win at least two titles in each decade until the 2010s.  His teams made the playoffs in 49 of his 50 seasons, missing it just once in 2003. He also had a winning record in 49 campaigns. Since Scates left, his former player John Speraw has not been able to replicate the former's success.  Scates himself was an All-American as a player for the Bruins. He also was on multiple USA teams that won titles, so his early playing career could be explored as well.  If the documentary were to follow the five-week format of The Last Dance, the decades would be a perfect splitting up point: the rise in the '60s, the domination of the '70s, '80s and '90s, and the slow decline in the 2000s until his retirement.

Sometimes, the best stories come out of failure.  Thats not to say that Jill Ellis career as the head coach of UCLA womens soccer was a failure  in fact, her 229-45-14 record undoubtedly brought the program to the next level. She led the Bruins to their first ever College Cup in her second season, and then did it seven more times in a row from 2003-2009.  But during her 12 seasons in Westwood, Ellis never made it to the top.  UCLA placed in the top-10 nationally every season under Ellis, finishing second or third each year from 2003-2009, and still never brought home a trophy.  In a lot of ways, thats more intriguing than a team winning the championship seven straight seasons. What went wrong? How did Ellis stay motivated? Was there any part of the coach that wanted to stay in Westwood another year  one more chance at a title  rather than moving on to coach the U.S. women's national team?  Beyond the coaching staff, the Bruins boasted 14 NSCAA All-Americans from 1999-2010, many coming out of Ellis seven top-5 recruiting classes. Players such as Sydney Leroux and Lauren Cheney, both of whom went on to compete for USWNT, would make interesting sources for a documentary.  And finally, to tie the narrative together, the series could end with a look at current head coach Amanda Cromwell  who came to UCLA in 2013 and won the program's first title right out of the gates.

Mendoza via Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]  Dave Roberts stole 109 bases during his three-year career as a Bruin. As a big-leaguer, he stole 243.  But one steal  which came on Oct. 17, 2004  to this day is the most clutch steal in baseball history.  With the Boston Red Sox down 4-3 in the bottom of the ninth inning, trailing the New York Yankees 3-0 in Game Four of the American League Championship Series, the former Bruin entered the game as a pinch runner on first base. On the first pitch he saw, Roberts was off for second, diving head first as his left hand beat the tag of Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter.  The rest is quite simply history.  Roberts would come around to score, tying the game and setting the stage for the Red Sox to win seven straight games and their first World Series since 1918.  But the story of Roberts isn't a Cinderella tale. The stars were not aligned in any way that would indicate Roberts would build the career he has today.  Roberts' four-year career as a Bruin started with a walk-on tryout, impressing coaches  unsurprising, in hindsight  with his speed. Upon graduating in 1995, Roberts was drafted in the 28th round of the MLB draft to the Detroit Tigers.  And now as the current manager for the Dodgers since 2016, Roberts has led his team to four-consecutive first-place finishes in the National League West, and his team remains one of the favorites to again challenge for the Commissioner's Trophy in the fall.  Selecting Roberts for a docuseries from a pool of UCLA baseball alums isn't an obvious choice. He doesn't carry the same legacy as Jackie Robinson, nor does he dominate the game like Gerrit Cole.  But Roberts is nonetheless an integral part of so many stories  for the Red Sox, for UCLA, for Los Angeles. The story of Dave Roberts is a part of baseball history and one that deserves celebration.   ""Miss Val""   Coral Smith, assistant Sports editor   [caption id=""attachment_380523"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Niveda Tennety/Assistant Photo editor)[/caption]  When producers are debating who to feature in sports documentaries, there are usually a few storylines that the writers are drawn to.  The underdog making their mark when others doubted them, off-field complications that were overcome and an eventual rise to the top are all staples of the classic sports story.  Well, all of these plot lines have been a part of Valorie Kondos Field's time as the head coach of UCLA gymnastics, together making a story that the public deserves to witness in a docuseries.  Kondos Field, known as ""Miss Val"" to her team and the fans, had never competed in gymnastics when she took her first position of choreographer and assistant coach for the team in 1983. Coming from a dance background, Kondos Field brought a fresh perspective into the sport, incorporating dance into the gymnasts' routines.  Winning her first championship in 1997  six years after being promoted to head coach  Kondos Field quickly solidified UCLA's status as a top contender in gymnastics, which has lasted to the present day.  In addition to the underdog success story Kondos Field was displaying in the gym, she also was facing challenges in the real world. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014, Kondos Field continued to coach the team while she fought and eventually beat the cancer.  Having won seven national championships in her 29 years as head coach to complete her status as one of the best gymnastics coaches ever, Kondos Field's final season in 2019 was marked by a farewell tour that was credited with renewing public interest in the sport, making people eager to consume more gymnastics content across the country.  And one year on from her emotional retirement, this is the perfect time to showcase the woman who was named the ""Pac-12 Gymnastics Coach of the Century,"" and whose rise to the top is one of the best stories in sports history.","['cap-sam-connon', 'cap-jack-perez', 'cap-jacqueline-dzwonczyk', 'cap-jared-tay', 'cap-coral-smith']","['baseball', 'gymnastics', 'mens-basketball', 'mens-volleyball', 'sports', 'sports-columns', 'womens-soccer']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.sp_.bote_.file_.jpg

While the all-women a cappella group will still center its   performance around its usual theme of female empowerment, it will move away from its usual cheery tunes. Instead, the group hopes to convey its message of unity and resilience through a medley of Destinys Childs Survivor and Keshas Praying. The inspiration for the arrangement and its emotional message came from the supportive atmosphere the group   promotes within itself, said president of Signature and second-year human biology and society student Chloe Winnett.  We call (the medley) a song for resilience, Winnett said. Its very much about a community of empowered women supporting each other, learning through trauma (and) developing themselves as people.  While the mashup contained themes of strength applicable to many of the performers' own experiences, its emotional impact made it challenging to practice, Winnett said. The gravity of the arrangement led to tearful rehearsals that would end with group hugs when they were able to practice in-person together. Through similar shared moments and discussions surrounding the emotional messages of the medley, the group became more closely bonded, Winnett said.  Signatures previous performances  though still focused on representing the strength of united women  have not been as raw and emotional. The decision to veer from the group's regular song choices came from a discussion about the power of   storytelling, which Winnett said   has led to the different direction it is taking from its last Spring Sing medley.  The last time Signature made an appearance at Spring Sing in 2015, its members performed a Beatles arrangement. Though it was fun to perform, Winnett said it was harder for a group of modern women to identify with songs written and performed by men in the 1960s. So for this years competition,   Signature   created a medley that related to its members more personally, which allowed the   emotional element to set itself apart from previous performances, said second-year human biology and society student Sapna Ramappa.  This piece means a lot to me because I've always been a huge feminist and ... a huge proponent of sticking together and supporting one another, Ramappa said. This medley ... we're performing strongly emphasizes this.  On top of its feminist narrative, Signature's performance this year aims to explore the connection between mothers and daughters through Survivor and the potent empathy of women with Praying."" Although the group has still kept the audience in mind, Signature's piece will be less focused on appealing to spectators, centering around a more grounded story   of   female compassion, Winnett said.  Along with its prerecorded audio   performance, Signature also produced a   conceptual art video to drive home   the message of its medley. The video will contain scenes of rehearsals and moments shared between Signature members as they prepared for Spring Sing. Ultimately, fourth-year dance student Sabina Schaffer said they hope the video is able to bring the virtual audience into their performance by demonstrating their group's behind-the-scenes   culture and creative processes.  (A) goal with our page is to kind of give people a little bit of a sneak peek of what its like to be in our group and in a community of women who love each other so much and love performing, Schaffer said.  Although the online nature of Spring Sing takes away the synergetic feel members usually have   while singing together, the obstacle   has allowed Signature to test new methods to bring forward   the members' identities as performers, Winnett said. During a live Spring Sing performance, spectators are not typically aware of Signatures intersectional backgrounds and personalities, but the groups accompanying video will attempt to close this gap, shedding light on the group as a community of united women and friends, Winnett said.  There have been times when we ... forget that its a performance because its such a celebration of who we are as women and who we are as musicians, Winnett said.",['cap-phoebe-chen'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Signature.jpg

The second-year economics student recently started a chalk drawing business to raise funds for the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. Initially drawing her elaborate chalk pieces for neighbors and locals walking past her home, Bass began taking requests from her followers on Instagram. She said she asks for a donation of $10 for each chalk request and sends her clients pictures of the finished products in return. Since she started the project, Bass said she has raised $2,748 for the LA Food Bank. The first $1,748 was donated on Giving Tuesday Now, and the amount was doubled by anonymous donors, she said. With each dollar being the equivalent of feeding four people, Bass' donations totaled to 13,984 meals.  &#8220;I had originally done chalk drawings on the street before this all started, and people really seemed to like it,"" Bass said.

She delved into her current art tool after entering a chalk drawing competition held at the beach a couple years ago and has entered every year since. With her leftover chalk supplies from these competitions, Bass said she figured they would be put to good use through her project.   Bass has previously worked to help alleviate food insecurity, having volunteered at food banks as well as working for multiple campus organizations like Swipe Out Hunger and Bruin Dine. She originally wanted to sign up again to help distribute food at the LA Food Bank in person but found there was a surplus of volunteers. The organization instead asked for monetary donations, so Bass said she wanted to figure out a way to raise more money than what she could from her own pocket   &#8211; thus creating the idea of her chalk drawing project.  &#8220;Anybody could be experiencing food insecurity, and it's an especially huge issue given the coronavirus,&#8221; Bass said. &#8220;I feel like the money that I donate to the food bank can really make a huge impact given the fact that each dollar is equivalent to feeding four people.""  A number of students requested new drawings to support Bass&#8217; cause, including second-year bioengineering student Evie Hunter, who said she saw Bass&#8217; post on Instagram advertising her project and was surprised at how detailed the chalk pieces were. Hunter said she decided to take part in the project by donating, requesting a drawing of Handsome Squidward.

Hunter said she saw   her donation to Bass's   chalk drawing project as a way to show her support in the same way. She was particularly interested in donating because the project involved Bass engaging in a personal skill while also helping others.  ""It really just struck me that she would just take a minute and think, 'How can I make this time that I have help other people while still doing something I can engage myself in,'"" Hunter said.  Not only did Bass' drawings help those affected by food insecurity, but they also served as a source of entertainment for neighbors and locals walking past her home.

UCLA alumnus and former Daily Bruin editor Robert Faturechi falls into the latter, said recent Pulitzer Prize winner T. Christian Miller.  Miller, Faturechi and Megan Rose recently won the  Pulitzer Prize  for National Reporting for investigative journalism with the newsroom ProPublica. The Pulitzer Prizes annually honor noteworthy journalism, literature and music produced in a given year.  The three journalists won the award for  Disaster in the Pacific,  an 18-month investigation into preventable fatalities in the U.S. Navys 7th Fleet, one of the U.S.s primary defenses against nuclear attacks and considered to be the strongest armada in the world.  Faturechis work in investigative journalism began at the Daily Bruin, where he wrote throughout his four years at UCLA and served as the editor of its investigative section, Enterprise, from 2007-2008.  As the Enterprise editor, Faturechi uncovered  bias toward donors  in the UCLA School of Dentistry admissions process and became hooked on investigative journalism, he said. The story won him the Society of Professional Journalists Sunshine Award.  After graduating with a degree in political science, Faturechi worked at The Seattle Times and The Sacramento Bee before moving to the Los Angeles Times in 2009.  He joined ProPublica in 2014. He also works as an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of Journalism.  Miller, who started the investigation, enlisted the help of Rose and Faturechi because he considered them to be some of the best reporters at ProPublica and they demonstrated interest and availability to join the investigation.  With the help of their editors, Tracy Weber and Joseph Sexton, they described the situations that led to the preventable deaths of 17 sailors and six Marines.  The 7th Fleet suffered poor training, broken ships and broken planes, while commanders concerns were ignored by Navy leadership, they reported.  Shortly after it was published, the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee confronted senior Navy leaders, according to ProPublica. The articles have since been included in training sailors and Naval officers.  Faturechi's straightforward nature typically convinces people to talk to him, Rose and Miller said. That skill was what the team needed to write up the story, Rose said.  During the investigation, Faturechi persuaded an official to hand over confidential documents about a fatal  aviation accident  that could have been prevented by Navy leadership, arguing that their investigation would hold Navy leadership accountable and prevent future accidents.  He knocked on the doors of Navy admirals' homes and traveled to Japan to talk with sailors, Miller said.  Faturechi also spoke to former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work. Rose said Work is considered a legend in the Pentagon and rarely participates in media stories, but Faturechi was able to convince him to speak on the record.  He had never reported on the military before, but his experience investigating abuses of power provided him the skills needed to undertake the Navy investigation, Faturechi said. During his time at The Los Angeles Times, Faturechis investigation into corruption in LA County Sheriff's Department leadership led to reformations of the county's jail system and the resignation of its sheriff.  There were times during the investigation he felt burnt out, Faturechi said.  For example, he pulled an all-nighter to fact-check an early story of the series.  (Later in the day) I had to go to the first birthing class with my wife, who was pregnant at the time, ... on zero sleep, he said.  There was no way to avoid burnout, Faturechi said. But he persisted because he knew Disaster in the Pacific would have an impact.  I dont like to see people get away with abuses and dishonesty, Faturechi said.",['cap-kari-lau'],"['a-closer-look', 'campus', 'national', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/20171213_portraits00280-2.jpg

This divestment affects approximately $125 billion worth of assets,  said Jagdeep Bachher , chief investment officer and vice president of investments, during the UC Investments Committee meeting. The decision took environmental impacts and financial responsibilities into account, Bachher said.  The endowment, the pension and all of our working capital pools are fossil-free at the University of California, Bachher said.  The endowment consists of investment portfolios for the University of California campus Foundations and the Regents General Endowment Pool. The pension funds help pay workers after retirement, and the working capital pools help the universities pay for various operational costs.  The UC Regents first made the decision to divest from fossil fuels about five or six years ago, Bachher said. Since then, the regents have made steady progress toward complete divestment. In  September , the Investments Committee announced the UCs $13.4 billion endowment had completely divested from all fossil fuels.  UC students began the process of advocating for divestment with protests years ago, and faculty soon joined the cause, said Naomi Goldenson, a stakeholder science lead at the Center for Climate Science at UCLA. The efforts of the  Fossil-Free UC campaign , including research, petitions, committees and meetings helped push the UC Regents to fully divest. Goldenson said it is baffling the regents are hesitant to take credit for their climate leadership.  This insistence that theyre only divesting from fossil fuels because it makes financial sense is a product of the same sort of reasoning that is giving us pay freezes for non-union employees: the bottom line comes before watching out for the common good, Goldenson said in an email statement.  The decision to divest has a symbolic meaning, and its impacts on the environment will be indirect, said Edward Parson, a Dan and Rae Emmett professor of environmental law at the UCLA School of Law.  Flows of capital around business are so enormous that no single actor, even one as big as the UC system, makes a big difference, said Parson, who is also a faculty co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.  The divestment may cut off capital from firms that process fossil fuels, which will have some benefits, but the most effective way to reduce the impact of fossil fuels will be through government regulations, he said.  The UC system has had to balance its goal to divest from fossil fuels with its responsibilities to students and faculty, Parson added.  Returns from endowment are one of the sources of income that universities use to finance their opportunities, Parson said.  The massive decline in cost of renewable energy from solar, wind and falling price of storage battery technologies means demand for fossil fuels will steadily decrease, said Deepak Rajagopal, an associate professor with the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability and Department of Urban Planning.  The UCs decision to divest may have a spillover effect, Rajagopal added. The UCs decision to divest might encourage other universities and large institutions to divest from fossil fuels, not only because it is a moral choice, but also because it will be a financially sound choice leading them to divest, he said.  It is beneficial for the UC system to set a positive example for other institutions, even if their reasoning was based primarily on financial concerns, Goldenson added.  Since the number of funds available to the UC system before the divestment was so large, it is likely green technology and sustainable industries were already represented in their portfolio, Parson said. Investment in sustainable industries increases the amount of capital available to green technology.  Shawn Fujioka, a third-year environmental science student, said she supports the decision to divest, especially because the UC is one of the largest college systems in the United States.  Any push away from fossil fuels is good (because the UC system is) one of the biggest college systems, she said.  Conor McCaulley, a third-year individual field of concentration student who focuses on green technology management, said he applauds the UC Regents for taking this crucial first step. He said it is also important for the UC to reinvest the money in green technology to further demonstrate its support for environmental concerns.  Although divestment decreases the ability of fossil fuel companies to raise money, it doesnt decrease the demand for fossil fuels, he said.  Rajagopal said he believes this is the right time for the UC system to make this decision because it is financially and environmentally prudent. Several analysts, including even a few oil companies themselves, believe oil demand will peak in the decade or so and then begin a slow but steady decline.  Its not a question of if, but when, he said.",['cap-celia-janes'],"['campus', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/news.ucfossilfuels.filephoto.jpg

Turner has been working in university administration as a dean or vice provost for around 20 years.  Turner first entered an administrative role in 1999 at UC Davis. She has been a member of the UCLA administration since 2013, when she replaced Judith Smith as dean and vice provost of the Division of Undergraduate Education. She has served as senior dean of UCLA College since 2016.  Turner led efforts to reaffirm UCLAs accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, which the school completed this year. Being accredited ensures UCLA meets WASCs standards of academic excellence.  Turner was always in the background kind of coordinating everything and, you know, making sure that the process went smoothly, said Darnell Hunt, dean of Social Sciences.  Turner also worked extensively with the Undergraduate Students Association Council on the reaccreditation process.  She had let me know that we were going through our accreditation process and she wanted us in student leadership to be a part of it, said USAC President Robert Watson, a fourth-year political science student.  One of Turners main goals when she first took on the position was to make sure each student was able to participate in undergraduate research or other programs relevant to their major, which she called a plus one.  If you just graduate with a transcript from UCLA, with a high GPA, that guarantees you very little, unfortunately, Turner said. You need at least a plus one. You need to demonstrate that youve done undergraduate research.  Turner said in order to be successful after graduation, it is important for undergraduate students to show they participated in research or extracurriculars relevant to their majors.  She said she made it one of her goals to ensure UCLA offered all the plus ones a university like UCLA could offer.  When Turner arrived at UCLA administration during the 2012-2013 school year, the state was still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. As a result, many of the challenges she faced were financial, she said.  For example, when Turner opened Undergraduate Research Week so all interested students could participate, the program quickly outgrew its budget.  Science Poster Day, as it was then called, was originally held in Ackerman Grand Ballroom. As the program grew, it was moved to the Pauley Pavilion, even though the budget remained unchanged.  I don't have a Pauley Pavilion budget, Turner said. I have an Ackerman (Grand) Ballroom budget.  Another of Turners goals as senior dean was to provide resources for first-generation college students like herself.  Turner also worked with Watson to make blue books and Scantrons free for students.  Watson said he first met Turner over lunch to discuss his platforms, including his initiative to make blue books and Scantrons free for students. The next day, Turner committed around $15,000 toward Watsons initiative.  Turner created Fiat Lux classes on the history and culture of UCLA, teaching some herself.  For the 2019-2020 school year, Turner and the person in charge of the program had aimed to create 100 of these courses in honor of UCLA's centennial.  The last time I checked, we were at 117, Turner said. We've exceeded the goal.  Turners last year as senior dean took an unexpected turn with the COVID-19 pandemic.  With classes moving online, it was important to Turner that students had the technology they needed to attend classes online. Some students told her they did not have sufficient internet access or personal computers to take classes from home, she said.  Turner and her team then created the Bruin Tech Fund, which raised around $1 million to provide low-income students the technology they needed to continue the school year from home.  Although her successor will be coming into a lot of challenges related to the pandemic, Turner is confident she and the administration have handled the crisis in a way that will ensure her successors success.  Despite the challenges, she said she knows her successor will be doing meaningful work.  When asked what qualities she would like to see in her successor, Turner said she thinks the person should be someone with stamina and a sense of humor.  I think you need, in this job, to be a good listener. And to be able to work collaboratively, you know, the college is run by five deans, Turner said about her successor.  Youlonda Copeland-Morgan, vice provost of enrollment management, said Turner has set a good example for the position of senior dean by knowing, collaborating and being willing to fight for her facility.  As for her future plans, Turner said she wants to go back to teaching and spending more time with students.  I dont think Ive ever met an undergraduate student I didnt like, Turner said.  She also said she is looking forward to being able to spend more time outdoors.  I'm a farmer's daughter; I want to be outside, Turner said.  Everyone in the college is going to miss having Turner as senior dean, Hunt said.  She has done an amazing job and set a strong foundation, Copeland-Morgan said. She's recruited an incredibly talented staff who have mirrored her leadership. And I think anyone stepping into this role will benefit from that strong foundation that she has set.",['cap-bobby-hekel'],"['a-closer-look', 'campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ns_.patricia.courtesy.jpg

Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.  When you work with (the virus) every day, you kind of just adapt and become more comfortable, said Scott McPherson. You just try to do the proper procedures ... and hope that it doesn't happen.  McPherson is a nurse who works with coronavirus patients daily at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.  The medical center is one of the biggest hospitals in Los Angeles, a city with over 27,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The hospital employs 1,500 full-time physicians and more than 2,500 as support staff. It is also the primary teaching hospital for David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.  At the medical center, patients with severe coronavirus cases are confined to the west side of the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care unit, where McPherson works.  Patients in the ICU are often reliant on ventilators or are likely to require one soon. Some patients also experience acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, which can prevent organs from receiving sufficient oxygen to properly function.  As a critical care nurse in the Cardiothoracic ICU, McPherson focuses on oxygenating and ventilating patients, as well as managing their ventilators, he said. For severe ARDS cases, McPherson said he will turn the patient on their stomach to increase the amount of oxygen in the patients blood in a procedure called prone ventilation.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, the unit has adjusted its routines and patient care methods to ensure the safety of both staff and patients.  Critical care nurses are given surgical scrubs so they do not have to use their regular scrubs when caring for coronavirus patients. In addition, masks must be worn in all regions of the hospital. This includes wearing simple surgical masks in the lobby and more protective masks within the critical care units. Certain nurses are designated to supervise and ensure proper compliance with personal protective equipment.  All the extra special protective equipment has made patient care more taxing, McPherson said. Nurses often get hot and sweaty wearing a gown, goggles and N95 mask while inside patient rooms.  The hospital also established procedures to protect nursing students who are working in the hospital, although not directly with coronavirus patients.  Before entering their shifts each day, nursing students are screened for coronavirus symptoms. They are given a single mask that will be used all day and must be discarded at the end of a shift, said fourth-year nursing student Ayaz Merchant.  Although the medical center has been able to provide critical care nurses with enough personal protective equipment, fear of infection has persisted.  The biggest fear is ... the unknown and getting your family sick, McPherson said. Especially in the beginning, it was extremely stressful. I think everybody was kind of on edge.  On top of managing their own stress, nurses are tasked with keeping their patients calm amid uncertainty and isolation. Since family members are not allowed in the ICU, patients are alone except for limited time spent with nurses and doctors.  They could have a TV on in the room, but it's 24/7 coronavirus, and there they are with the coronavirus, ... just wondering if they're going to survive, or what's going to happen to them, McPherson said. It's just kind of a surreal experience for (patients).  The new circumstances have also altered nursing students plans for their immersion requirement.  Nursing students begin working in the hospital winter quarter of their third year. After gradually gaining hospital experience, in the final quarter of their senior year, students are assigned to a hospital, unit and nurse who they must work alongside for 280 hours in order to graduate.  Wenzel was originally scheduled to work in the Labor and Delivery Unit at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, but she was informed on short notice that the Labor and Delivery departments had been switched into COVID-19 units. Instead, Wenzel was assigned to work within the Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA.  I was honestly pretty devastated when I found out that I couldn't work in labor and delivery, Wenzel said. I eventually want to be a midwife and women's health nurse practitioner, so maternity and (obstetrics) stuff is my jam.  Although faced with a difficult switch, Wenzel is grateful for the opportunity to continue to work in the hospital units at UCLA, as many other universities have postponed their students academic schedules because of the coronavirus, she said.  I think it's made us all really recognize that even though we want to work in specific areas, our job is to protect the health of everyone, Wenzel added.  Merchant has also grappled with the sudden and unexpected changes in his immersion plans.  Merchant said that he was not entirely comfortable with the unpredictability of the pandemic at first, but he came to understand that in nursing, the risk is inevitable.  I chose this profession to become a nurse and be the frontline in health care and be part of the essential task force in cases such as a pandemic like this, and personally I look forward to tackling the obstacles and challenges that come with being in the hospital during this national emergency, Merchant said.","['cap-breannah-cavazos', 'cap-megan-mccallister']","['a-closer-look', 'campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/reagan-ia.jpg

The wildcat strike, a strike not approved by a union, will continue indefinitely until graduate students demands for higher wages and affordable housing are met, striking workers said.  The student-workers, who gathered for a rally on Janss Steps on Thursday, agreed they would strike only if 10 different departments release statements agreeing to participate. Participating graduate students will not teach or grade if the strike occurs.  Graduate students from at least three departments  including anthropology, gender studies and Chicana and Chicano studies  have expressed support for the strike, but no department has officially released a statement of support.  [embed]https://www.youtube.com/embed/__e7HwKDQGM[/embed]  &nbsp;  Organizers may pursue alternative forms of protest if not enough departments approve the strike, said Sucharita Kanjilal, an organizer and an anthropology graduate student. Graduate students from each department will collectively decide the conditions of approval.  The strike comes after weeks of protests and demonstrations by graduate student workers across the University of California advocating for wage increases adjusted to the cost of living.  UC Santa Cruz graduate students first went on strike in December, refusing to release undergraduate fall grades. The strikes continued Feb. 10 as some teaching assistants still withheld grades. At least 17 students were arrested during protests, and UC Santa Cruz fired 54 graduate student employees who still had not turned in grades Feb. 28.  Around 30 more students said they were told they would not be eligible for spring quarter teaching positions after participating in the protests, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Columnist Alissa Evans puts her cognitive science degree to use in Silver Screen Psychology, comparing movies and shows that boast accurate depictions of mental health to those that sacrifice authenticity for drama.     Warning: spoilers ahead.    Dissociative identity disorder can be so  misunderstood  in the mental health community that some believe it doesn&#8217;t exist.  Although DID is considered rare, Dr. Stephen Marmer, a psychiatrist and senior clinical faculty member in UCLA's Department of Psychiatry, said he has treated patients with the disorder. Some nonbelievers claim DID symptoms are  induced by therapists , but psychiatrists like Marmer &#8211; along with the fifth edition of the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" &#8211; recognize DID as a  valid disorder  that is distinct from mental illnesses like schizophrenia, which it is often compared to.   Despite DID's   low prevalence rates  , however, the disorder remains prominent in popular films like &#8220;Psycho,&#8221; &#8220;Fight Club,&#8221; &#8220;Split&#8221; and &#8220;Glass.""   [Related:    Silver Screen Psychology: While some films explore schizophrenia sensitively, others perpetuate stereotypes   ]   Characters like Kevin in ""Split"" &#8211; whose 24 distinct personality states range from a 9-year-old Kanye West fan to an adult fashion designer &#8211; exemplify such dramatization, with flagrant shifts between alternate identities that are more sensationalized than accurate. In reality, the differences between each alter are usually subtle, Marmer said, as DID often develops as a hidden coping mechanism for victims of severe childhood abuse.  &#8220;What they need to do is somehow imagine that it's really not happening to them or to find a way to placate their abuser without feeling guilty about it,&#8221; Marmer said. &#8220;That dissociation is a survival defense ... that helps them get through childhood.&#8221;  &#8220;Split&#8221; addresses childhood trauma both through flashbacks and conversations with Kevin&#8217;s therapist. But while &#8220;Split&#8221; and its sequel &#8220;Glass&#8221; correctly identify the most frequent cause of DID, the films'   portrayal of the disorder's   actual symptoms is hyperbolic at best and stigmatizing at worst. Kevin is a homicidal kidnapper with multiple violent and out-of-control personality states, perpetuating the common misconception that people with DID are prone to violence.  But M. Night Shyamalan&#8217;s trilogy is not the first to misrepresent the disorder, as the use of DID in &#8220;Psycho&#8221; as an explanation for Norman Bates&#8217; murderous behavior is perhaps equally problematic. In actuality, people with DID are  no more likely  to commit crimes than the general population, and they are more likely to be revictimized. Bates' homicidal tendencies and Kevin&#8217;s superhuman, people-eating identity called &#8220;The Beast&#8221; therefore feed into the  myth  that people with DID often possess an evil alter.    Yet such violent behavior is not the only sensationalized aspect of &#8220;The Beast.&#8221; It is very unlikely that someone with DID would have an identity so dramatically and outwardly different from the others, as only  5% to 6  %  of people with DID show overt   presentations of their alters. When someone with DID switches between alters, they rarely exhibit a drastic shift in personality, and each alter is unlikely to have dramatically different preferences, accents or clothes. But despite some films&#8217; inaccuracies, Marmer said he understands that hyperbole   is a major part of filmmaking.  &#8220;(Filmmakers) are in the business of making a dramatic story and drama requires caricature and exaggeration, but it does give a wrong impression as to what (DID) is all about,&#8221; Marmer said.  Exaggeration pervades &#8220;Split&#8221; and &#8220;Glass,&#8221; as Kevin&#8217;s alters are not representative of how DID symptoms may  typically be expressed . Nevertheless, Marmer said personality states can noticeably differ &#8211; some might be more depressed, some more reckless or some more sexual.  Such is the case in &#8220;Fight Club,&#8221; where Brad Pitt&#8217;s character is a reckless adrenaline seeker who diverts the narrator&#8217;s attention from the monotony of everyday life. Although the narrator is  never explicitly diagnosed  with DID, he has more than one personality state and experiences recurrent amnesia, which Marmer said are common symptoms of the disorder. But the narrator&#8217;s visual hallucinations and conversations with his alter are generally unusual symptoms for someone with untreated DID, Marmer said.   [Related:    Movie review: Characters&#8217; relationship makes &#8216;Extraction&#8217; stand out among action movies   ]     People with DID may not receive immediate treatment because their alters are hidden, or because a therapist may only interact with one of the client's personality states, Marmer said. On average, people with DID usually circulate within the mental health system for around  seven years  before receiving an accurate diagnosis. And since DID often develops as a defense mechanism in response to other variables, people frequently downplay the condition and conceal their alters.      However, if the subtlety of switching between alters was better understood, perhaps symptoms would be more easily recognizable, leading to quicker diagnosis and early effective treatments. Media can play a role in educating the public by finding novel ways to distinguish between a person&#8217;s alternate identities without overdramatizing the switching process.  Fewer exaggerated portrayals might also lessen the extent to which people with DID are othered in society. Although only a small percentage of the population will experience DID in their lifetime, Marmer said there is a degree of normal multiplicity &#8211;  almost everyone  has acted out of character or dissociated while completing a routine task. While such mild experiences are not comparable to a clinical disorder like DID, recognizing even the smallest connections can help mitigate the misperception that people with DID are different or other.  &#8220;We have these expressions in English like 'I wasn't myself today' or 'I lost my head,&#8217;&#8221; Marmer said. &#8220;We all have these little micro-moments from time to time when, especially under great stress, we do things that we normally wouldn't do.&#8221; ",['cap-alissa-evans'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/ae.silverscreenpsychology.4.courtesy.jpg

The U.S. Census, which occurs every 10 years, counts all the people living or residing in the United States. People have until August 14 to participate in the census.  The purpose of the census is to allocate the number of members in the U.S. House of Representatives per state and to distribute federal funding to communities based on the census data, said Jeffrey Enos, the deputy regional director of the Los Angeles region of the U.S. Census Bureau.  &#8220;Hundreds of billions of dollars of federal funding are distributed to communities across the country based on the census data,&#8221; Enos said. &#8220;Grant proposals and grants are funded based on the census data and so it&#8217;s very important that everyone is counted, including college students.&#8221;   The information from the census and from surveys that come out of the census are used to make inferences about the needs of different populations, said Natalie Masuoka, an associate professor of political science at UCLA.  &#8220;That&#8217;s one of the reasons why it&#8217;s really, really important for us to have everyone,&#8221; Masuoka said. &#8220;Especially for those populations that really do have needs that they want the federal government to address, (and) make sure that they are counted on the census&#8221;  An accurate count is also extremely important in making sure that resources are allocated to UCLA, Masuoka added.  The census data informs federal funding for services and programs such as highway construction, school lunches, education and Medicaid. It also impacts funding for Pell Grants, school safety, and mental health services, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  An inaccurate count could affect some of the federal funding in programs such as special assistance programs, said Jennie Brand, a sociology and statistics professor and director of the California Center for Population Research.  &#8220;Anything that relies on federal funding that students utilize can be impacted by the census count,&#8221; Brand said. &#8220;Even if the resources to the community around UCLA get disrupted that ends up impacting the students.&#8221;  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many college students to temporarily relocate from their housing near their campus.  UCLA  moved spring quarter classes online  in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and encouraged students living on the Hill to move out. More than  80% of Hill residents  have left in response to the announcement.  Students should determine how to count themselves based on where they live the majority of the time as of April 1, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  The Census Bureau categorizes students into two groups, Enos said.  The first category is students who live in the dorms, university-recognized fraternity and sorority houses, university apartments or any other on-campus housing.  Students in this group don&#8217;t have to respond to the census since they&#8217;ve already been counted by the university, Enos said.  The other category of students are the students who live in off-campus, non-university owned housing. They have to respond on their own, Enos said.  Students can fill out the census form in three ways: online, over the phone or through a paper census form, and it takes less than 10 minutes, Enos added.  Masuoka said students should be proactive to make sure that they are being counted, adding that it&#8217;s better to be over-counted than under-counted.  &#8220;My kind of strong recommendation is to make sure that each and every person in the United States, (makes) sure that they understand where they should be counted,&#8221; Masuoka said. &#8220;If they&#8217;re assuming someone else&#8217;s counting them then they need to reach out to make sure that they are in fact being counted.&#8221;  The data received in the census is protected and can&#8217;t be shared with any company, organization or government agency, Enos said. There are also no questions about immigrant status, he added.  &#8220;We don&#8217;t ask citizenship status,&#8221; Enos said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a simple population count.&#8221; ",['cap-saumya-gupta'],"['national', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.coronacensus.JHan_.jpg

[caption id=""attachment_379506"" align=""alignright"" width=""300""]  Council members were evaluated in these areas on a scale from one to five, with one being poor performance and five being excellent performance.[/caption]   Although a few of her biggest projects were slated to launch in spring quarter, it is clear Shaw has proactively worked throughout the year to lay the foundational groundwork for those projects.&nbsp;    For example, one of her biggest and loftiest platforms was implementing a reusable container system in dining halls on the Hill. The board had expressed concern about the feasibility of this goal last year, as previous commissioners had not been successful in coordinating with administration to accomplish the same goal.    However, Shaw has managed to successfully overcome the obstacles previous commissioners have struggled with, and UCLA Dining Services has agreed to a trial run of the program and worked out all the technical logistics of how the program would operate on campus. Although this has now been put on hold because of the uncertainties regarding the situation surrounding COVID-19, the board is impressed with the work Shaw has done to solidify the program and laying the foundations for its launch in the future.&nbsp;    In addition, Shaw has successfully collaborated with various administrative entities and campus organizations to push forward initiatives to improve transportation, lighting and accessibility on campus. She has also been active in advocating on behalf of students with disabilities, helping foster the creation of a disabled student union.    One platform she has not been entirely successful in, however, is finding adequate spaces for cultural organizations on campus, a notoriously difficult task students have tried to tackle for years.    Although she could have done more wide-scale outreach, Shaw has done a good job overall engaging with students and establishing FACs presence on campus. She has continued to regularly hold on-campus events such as the second annual Disability Rights Town Hall and quarterly Bruin Bazaars, for which FAC has collaborated with other sustainability and basic needs organizations for the first time.&nbsp;    Shaw has been exemplary in pushing for increased transparency within the commission as well as on the council table. After making guidelines for The Green Initiative Fund more clear and accessible, FAC saw a significant increase in the number of funding applications it received from students and was able to fund $130,000 worth of student sustainability projects this year. In addition to making TGIF more accessible to students, Shaw also implemented it as one of the funding bodies required to disclose allocations at council meetings.&nbsp;    Overall, Shaw has been largely successful in meeting her goals for her office and the campus community.

But for many UCLA students, challenges with the university&#8217;s portals &#8211; Common Collaboration and Learning Environment and MyUCLA &#8211;   are nothing new.  CCLE allows students to access their course syllabuses, assignments, grades and other resources. MyUCLA, alternatively, is a website utilized for many student services, most notably enrollment and grading updates. Information   is shared between both platforms   to translate academic feedback from CCLE to MyUCLA.     If only that information was shared efficiently.    Currently, students don't have a solid understanding of their letter grade until it's carried over from CCLE to MyUCLA &#8211; which often does not happen until the last couple weeks of the quarter. Beyond that, professors and departments upload grades inconsistently between the websites, making it difficult for students to know where to look.   In a time when online resources are all students have,    UCLA must strengthen the link between the two portals so that students are more aware of their grades before it is too late to change them. With no in-person office hours or feedback, students need consistent access to updated grades to succeed academically. This is especially important when students have the option to choose Pass/No Pass grading anytime before finals week, considering that missing grades could prevent them from making the decision to change their grade type. Unless UCLA can ensure better accessibility of grades, the university needs to implement a new system across the board.    And it's not just students who are affected by this unorganized system.  &#8220;One thing I do not like right now is the fact that it&#8217;s very hard for MyUCLA and the grade book on MyUCLA to talk to the grade book in CCLE,&#8221; said Anthony Friscia, a UCLA adjunct professor in the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology. &#8220;That part is really annoying, so it&#8217;s hard to keep students up to date on what&#8217;s going on with their grades and things like that because of it.&#8221;  So while instructors might be providing insightful comments and individual assignment grades to students on CCLE, students are still left guessing about their overall course progress.   This is a critical time for students to keep track of their grades. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to online learning, students can now  take more than one class  during spring quarter on a Pass/No Pass grading basis.  Pass/No Pass grading enables students to take a class without the distinction of a letter grade. As a result, this grading option allows students to take classes for units without the class affecting their GPA. This is an important decision for students who find themselves struggling with the transition to online learning.   But without a grasp on what grade they are on track for, this decision is difficult to make.   Isba Keshwani, a first-year astrophysics student, agrees that CCLE should be more efficient in communicating course grades with students.  &#8220;I never know what grade I have,&#8221; Keshwani   said.   &#8220;Now that we're remote, our grades are more based on homework, and sometimes even participation for some of my classes. So I feel like (the grading portals)   should make it more possible to give you your grades as you go on.&#8221;  This is why many UCLA instructors turn to third-party grading websites, like Gradescope.   Kirie Stromberg, a graduate student in archaeology, uses Gradescope to give her students a more updated look on their grades. In addition, she said Gradescope is often simpler to use.     &#8220;I think you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find any professor or TA right now who isn&#8217;t using at least one other online platform in addition to what we have from UCLA,"" Stromberg said.  In light of this, UCLA should consider converting to more mainstream grading portals, like Canvas or Blackboard, across all departments. In fact, many other schools within the University of California system use Canvas, such as UC Davis and UC Irvine.   It would certainly be easier to have one unified grading portal instead of the countless sites that different instructors choose as supplements to the deficient UCLA option.  Stromberg noted this was another flaw with having to use other   additional   academic websites as companions to UCLA sites.  &#8220;Then (students) have to have like 20 different things depending on what each instructor is using,&#8221; Stromberg said.  Students are already facing major challenges with the pandemic and the transition to online learning, whether that be technical difficulties or a lack of motivation. And having to sort through multiple websites just to check grades and assignments only adds to this stress.  However, CCLE and MyUCLA do offer elements exclusive to UCLA students. One of CCLE's advantages   is that it offers one website for all of a student&#8217;s classes &#8211; one place for a class&#8217; syllabus, assignments, readings, Turnitin and instructor feedback. But despite these distinct advantages, students still lack the ability to view their letter grade progress throughout the quarter.   So even if UCLA grading stays on the MyUCLA and CCLE interfaces, the communication between the two websites, and thus between students and their instructors, needs improvement.  Because in an era when office hours have been replaced by online portals, it is UCLA&#8217;s responsibility to ensure these websites are the best they can be.

The switch to online classes in response to COVID-19 has left a major impact on art students who rely heavily on visual learning to complete their classes, said Yogan Muller, a visiting design media arts lecturer. Muller said he has adjusted his lesson plans by giving students the freedom to choose a research topic for their final project and spending class periods reviewing their homework, introducing new graphic design techniques, and discussing their creative endeavors outside the classroom.  I try to maintain my sense of presence, which is one of the main missions as an instructor, Muller said. Teaching online is hard to do in its entirety, and it is my duty to accommodate those who need help.   [Related:    English Fiat Lux classes center around understanding, studying COVID-19s impacts   ]   To make his lectures mirror a real-life classroom, Muller is utilizing screen sharing and the breakout rooms setting on Zoom, which allows the lecture to condense into more intimate gatherings.  To further foster this collaborative environment, Muller co-teaches the course Design Media Arts 154: ""Word + Image with professor Rebeca Mndez and graduate student Zeynep Abes. Although online instruction limits the artistic resources students have at their disposal, Muller said Zoom and email offer opportunities for students and professors to discuss their creative work.  This collaboration is crucial when it comes to deciding on a creative project topic, so Abes said professors need to ensure an engaging learning environment. Since she worked as a teaching assistant last year, Abes said she was able to see how the course operated within the classroom and now   aims to encourage more one-on-one time with her students.  While in regular instruction, Abes said students rarely attended office hours early in the quarter, but online instruction has encouraged more interaction. This increased communication helped ease the online transition and made the students more compelled to discuss their creative ideas for future projects, Abes said.  Online instruction feels more intimate to me because I have been meeting students in my office hours one on one, Abes said. I have had more productive office hour meetings with the students just talking to them and making sure they are all doing OK.   [Related:    Bruin Origami For All folds paper into hope in online Zoom sessions   ]   For their first project, students will choose a topic pertaining to a pertinent ecological phenomenon that piques their interest. They then conduct investigative research and present their findings through graphic design. Muller said many artists rely on human interaction to bounce ideas off one another in these freeform style assignments. But the online class' interactive format assures students can have their voices heard and connect with other people despite the physical distance, Abes said.  Connecting through the screen in this way has become the new normal for art students in quarantine. Professor Erkki Huhtamo, who is teaching the Fiat Lux seminar Design Media Arts 19: ""UCLA Centennial Initiative: Media Culture and First 100 Years,"" said he is doing live online lect  ures as opposed to prerecorded ones to keep his students engaged with the material. Huhtamo said he also utilizes the chatbox on Zoom to effectively answer questions and incorporates visuals such as videos from his own collection to keep students invested.  I dont find it unpleasant to teach from my home because I have access to all my archives and materials,"" Huhtamo said. ""I show things through my laptop camera and external video camera and have noticed there are many positive possibilities in this form of teaching.  Without access to campus resources such as the print lab and art supplies, it may seem as if the arts community is at a disadvantage. Students may not have all their usual resources, but Huhtamo said collaboration and collective creativity with their professors help them express themselves through art.  I dont think there is anything useful in being negative about things, Huhtamo said. Life can be unpredictable, and when unpredictable circumstances happen we have to adjust ourselves to those things, and if we are lucky we will discover something new.",['cap-ashley-lifton'],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ae_.desmaclasses.km_.jpg

Researchers without sufficient funds can petition the library to cover the remainder of the cost.  Academic research has traditionally been closed access, meaning universities have to pay publishers subscription costs to give researchers access to publications in academic journals.  Conversely, articles in open-access journals are publicly available at no cost to readers. Instead of subscription charges, open-access journals levy an article-processing charge to researchers once their article passes peer review.  The UCs deal would benefit researchers with low grant funding, such as early-career researchers and researchers in the humanities and social sciences, by allowing them to submit their work to PLOS for publication more easily.  The deal is part of a larger transition toward open-access academic publishing practices by the UC.  The UC has been repurposing its journal expenditures to support open-access publishing, said Ivy Anderson, the associate executive director of the UC California Digital Library, in an emailed statement. The UC believes making its research open access serves the public good by discovering and transmitting knowledge, Anderson said.  The University Committee on Library and Scholarly Communication announced it would focus on a transition from closed, subscription-based publishing services to open-access services in an April 2018  statement , citing shrinking library budgets and exorbitant price increases by publishers.  Commercial publishers have some of the highest profit margins of any industry, and the majority of UC research resides behind a subscription paywall, according to the statement.  We feel we have a duty to set clear terms and conditions that ensure such taxpayer money gets spent in the most ethically, morally, and socially-responsible way, and expressly for the greater good, the statement read.  Open-access deals typically shift publishing costs from the university to the researcher, said Arun Durvasula, a graduate student at UCLA. However, the UCs arrangement with PLOS returns the burden of article-processing charges back to the university, while also giving members of the public and researchers at small universities access to academic research, he added.  Although academic research has historically been closed access, Durvasula added, most scientists support open access  they want anyone interested in the research to be able to read their articles.  I think (open access) is the future, he said. I'd like to be in a place where that is the norm, things are just open access and that's not really a discussion.  Dennis Ventry Jr., the Chair of the Academic Senate University Committee on Library and Scholarly Communication, said the UC began to transition toward open-access journals in the early 2010s, partly because it felt it was paying traditional academic journals twice  once to access journals, and again to pay article-processing charge costs if they wanted to make the article open access.  Subscription-based services also began to lose their value because federally funded research articles can only be held under a paywall for one year, he added.  The deal with PLOS comes after the UC announced it wouldnt renew its subscription with the major publisher Elsevier in  July 2019 . Even though researchers lost access to some Elsevier journals, many researchers were able to utilize past open-access deals by the UC  a UC survey taken in  February  found the termination of the Elsevier deal had limited impact on UC researchers.  The UC plans to negotiate with Elsevier again in the first fiscal quarter of 2020. Although the deal with PLOS is separate from any Elsevier deal, Ventry said the new negotiations will be influenced by the successful arrangements with PLOS and other large publishers.  Dan Morgan, the director of community relations for PLOS, said open-access publishing practices offer more transparency by charging flat publishing fees, and help people understand what their money is paying for, whereas charges from traditional academic journals are less clear.  There are some bad players in open-access publishing, but the same bad actors exist in traditional publishing, and in general, open access still offers more transparency, he added.  Making academic research public allows everyone to benefit from academic research and inform themselves on important issues, such as climate change, said Alan Barreca, an associate professor at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, in an emailed statement.  There are only positives with open-access journals, he said. The negatives are that there are too few open-access (journals).""",['cap-bernard-mendez'],"['news', 'science-health', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.news_.plos_.courtesy.jpg

The two have been dating for four months. They now communicate through digital channels since Floods home is in Southern California and Sharps temporary residence is in Northern California.  Sharp, a first-year psychology and English student, said she is holding onto hope that she can see Flood, a first-year political science and Middle Eastern studies student, in the upcoming fall or winter quarter.  It's important that people have things to look forward to, Sharp said.  Couples at UCLA separated because of the pandemic are now facing the difficulties of maintaining long-distance relationships.  Flood said the initial separation was difficult for them and Sharp. They almost broke up early on.  It wasn't because of any problem with our relationship, Flood said. It was literally just the situation.  Relationships may be more vulnerable in times of stress and separation, but they still need the same fundamental components, said Theodore Robles, a psychology professor.  One simple rule of thumb is to every day do something that makes your partner feel understood, ... feel valued and feel cared for, Robles said.  In any healthy relationship, partners should strive for those three ends, Robles said.  Partners can talk about stress to show they understand what the other is going through, Robles said. Even small acts, like buying them a meal they love, can show a significant other they are cared for, Robles said.  Kevin Naseri and Melody Chan are living in California and Florida, respectively, after leaving UCLA. They have been dating for a little over a year.  Because it is their first time being long-distance during the school year, they have had to become more patient with each other, said Chan, a second-year business economics student.  You cant expect that person to be by your side all the time, and you also have to take into consideration all the stuff that theyre dealing with, said Naseri, a second-year pre-economics student.  Among other challenges, students are facing transitions to online classes and changes of residence, all of which can complicate a relationship.  Sharp and Flood considered moving in together during quarantine but decided against it because Floods parents are both health care workers, and Floods mother has asthma. Flood was afraid that if their mother fell sick, they wouldnt be able to visit.  Their relationship suffered during these transitions, Sharp said. She and Flood both felt the burden of not being able to talk about their relationship to family members, unlike at UCLA, where they could openly discuss issues with friends.  Being at UCLA was kind of like a fantasyland where homophobia pretty much didn't exist, Flood said. And now that you're at home, it's like, Oh yeah, I forgot about that.  Furthermore, Sharp said that bad experiences with long-distance relationships in the past made her overthink every interaction with her partner when they were first separated.  It even kind of made it to the point where Blue got sad talking to me, because it just felt so different than what we were used to, Sharp said.  When Flood brought up how different things felt, and Sharp shared her feelings, they went back to interacting the way they had before, Flood said.  Chan and Naseri experienced dating long-distance before the pandemic, so when it came about, they werent completely lost, Chan said.  Chan also had advice for people dating long-distance for the first time.  Try to make more time to just talk to each other, especially if there are issues or any tension that comes up, and not just keep it bottled up inside, Chan said.  Sexual partners may also have to adjust if they are separated during this time, said Nina Sheridan, co-director of the student group Sexperts. Sexperts is a committee under the Student Wellness Commission that focuses on student sexual health and education.  Sheridan, a fourth-year molecular, cell, and developmental biology student, said she could not speak for Sexperts on the topic of sexual relationships, but she could offer personal advice.  Video calling, voice calling and texting are all potential avenues for staying sexually active with a partner, Sheridan said.  The main thing that you're going to want to focus on is the fact that both of you are comfortable, and the awkwardness of it being via a virtual channel isn't getting in the way, Sheridan said.  Partners should experiment and communicate to find the right fit. The specific way partners communicate is especially important, Sheridan said.  Using I statements is actually a really, really powerful thing, Sheridan said. So never placing blame on either the medium or the partner, but always phrasing a statement in terms of how you feel.  Despite her panic and doubt when the pandemic first forced their relatively new relationship onto digital screens, Sharp said it was worth the tough adjustment.  Of course I miss them, Sharp said. But it's better to have them and miss them than to not be with them at all.",['cap-maddie-rausa'],"['a-closer-look', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/relationshiptips.jpg

Unfortunately, those classes create a new set of stressors for Bruins with their sights set on graduate school.    Students at UCLA have been sent home to prevent the spread of COVID-19, with instruction to take place remotely through the end of spring. Needless to say, the situation has created immense stress for students, some of whom have lost jobs or been directly impacted by the virus.  Fortunately, students are allowed more control over the stressors of academic life &#8211; and that&#8217;s where Pass/No Pass grading systems come in. UCLA recently made this grading option easier to access by allowing students to take multiple classes on a Pass/No Pass basis and allowing them to make their choice later in the quarter.  But what might sound like a perfect alternative is also an option many students don&#8217;t have.  That&#8217;s because most graduate schools, including medical schools like the David Geffen School of Medicine, don&#8217;t look favorably upon applicants who take many classes on a Pass/No Pass basis in college &#8211; a fact which may discourage many students from even considering the option during their last quarter of an unexpectedly short senior year.  In order to truly make Pass/No Pass classes available to students looking for relief this spring, graduate schools must make a commitment not to hold the decision against applicants &#8211; at least not for students who make the decision only for this term. As the No. 1 public university in the nation, UCLA's graduate schools have an opportunity to announce this new policy in their admissions &#8211; and set a precedent for other universities to prioritize the mental well-being of their students.    This is especially important considering the massive stress and frustration already placed on graduating seniors.   For many, this is the first major crisis they will be experiencing as adults. Add to that the fact that they will be learning remotely from professors who have yet to master a Zoom conference and it becomes clear that spring quarter will be unprecedented in its difficulty.   But changing graduate school admissions policies during this crisis is one small detail that could make a world of difference.   Considering the massive changes over the past weeks, the looming uncertainty of the future and the stretched capacity of Counseling and Psychological Services and other on-campus mental health resources, the university would be wise to implement anything that could ease the burden.    UCLA has acted quickly to make sweeping changes to the availability of its Pass/No Pass system, and it&#8217;s a good first step. But while that gives students the option of alleviating their stress by choosing a grading method, it does nothing to ease their fears that doing so might harm their futures in academia.  Granted, the university has a lot on its plate. But announcing this change immediately and advocating for other universities to do the same could stand to have a truly meaningful impact on hopeful graduate school applicants across the country.  Because otherwise, the option of Pass/No Pass is no option at all. ",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/edi-1-1024x618.png

The UCLA English department is currently offering three Fiat Lux courses centered around COVID-19. Professors from various departments will guide students toward a deeper understanding of the pandemic&#8217;s effects through exploring theories of rhetoric, advertising and pop culture.  As a result, these courses provide professors and students the freedom to think critically about the impacts of the pandemic, said Michael Berry, director of the UCLA Center for Chinese Studies. Berry will join the discussion in King-Kok Cheung&#8217;s Fiat Lux course concerning the representation of China in the media.  &#8220;Courses like this provide a platform to explore what is happening behind the headlines and really think deeply about the broader implications,&#8221; Berry said. &#8220;A lot of students are not in a state of mind to focus on their studies. All they are thinking about is the coronavirus, and these courses provide an outlet to explore this issue from a nuanced and multifaceted perspective.&#8221;   [Related:    Scattered Bruins: International students from China explore new art forms while in isolation   ]   Cheung, who is also a professor of English and Asian American studies leads the Fiat Lux course English 19: &#8220;COVID-19: Formation of Imagined Community through Digital Media,&#8221; built on theorist Benedict Anderson's &#8220;Imagined Communities.&#8221; The book explores how a sense of community was created by the readers and writers with the rise of newspapers.  In Cheung&#8217;s course, the importance of literature and choice of words will also be addressed, focusing on events such as President Donald Trump&#8217;s decision to refer to coronavirus as the &#8220;Chinese virus&#8221; and the viral spread of the &#8220;Wuhan Diary&#8221; by Fang Fang, which follows the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. She said it is important for students to understand the danger of censorship and that an open exchange of information is necessary to arrest this pandemic more quickly.  In a separate class, associate professor Caroline Streeter analyzes how social media utilizes music and parody as a response to the virus in English 19: &#8220;COVID-19: Viral Media during Pandemic - Social Media, Music, and Coronavirus.&#8221; One such song being discussed is the widely popular &#8220;Ghen C&#244; Vy,&#8221; produced in collaboration with the National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health in Vietnam, which served as a public service announcement to adopt a sanitary lifestyle in light of the virus. Since its release, a TikTok dance using the song has become popular as well, with choreography based on proper handwashing techniques.   [Related:    Theater students improvise virtual methods to replace in-person productions   ]   The course also examines the changing industry of advertising and the spread of messages on social media in wake of COVID-19. After witnessing international cooperation through platforms like TikTok, popular traditional aspirational advertising methods &#8211; with celebrities in the limelight &#8211;  are being challenged by the successful rise of authenticity, Streeter said. The common people tend to hold the spotlight in pop culture today instead, she said, influencing the general public on social media platforms and beyond.  &#8220;I think social media is really showing us a different side, ... that there are things that matter more to people than conventional good looks and wealth,&#8221; Streeter said. &#8220;There's something about being genuine and being spontaneous, maybe even being goofy, and that relatability is not just about the aspirational.&#8221;  In a more literary approach to the pandemic, UCLA associate professor Robert Maniquis teaches the course English 19: &#8220;COVID-19: Albert Camus' The Plague: Physical Disease and Disease as Social Metaphor.&#8221; Students will use works such as &#8220;The Plague&#8221; and analyze it in the context of present circumstances, discussing topics concerning disease, such as living in quarantine, that were far from everyday discussion a year ago.  With these three courses, students are encouraged not simply to witness the unfolding of events the pandemic brings, but understand them, critically analyze them and develop new perspectives of looking at them Cheung said. After being moved entirely online, the Fiat Lux courses offer more space to accommodate students, Cheung said, for those who wish to join the discussion on Zoom.  &#8220;We need to have people with all kinds of nationalities, all kinds of dissident views to be able to speak,"" Cheung said.

The recent move to online learning has affected every department at UCLA, but for students in the UCLA School of Nursing and the David Geffen School of Medicine, these changes could make the difference between an effective future nurse and an unqualified student.  In-person clinical hours, usually in abundance for students in these programs, have been hard to come by now that the  California Board of Registered Nursing has decreased  the number of clinical hours students are required to perform from 75% to 50%.  While this change is meant to help students continue their graduation requirements despite difficulty placing them in in-person clinics, loosening required person-to-person hours doesnt address   the lack of in-person opportunities for certain classes, and may produce less capable health care workers. An opt-in program for current nursing students eager for an opportunity on the front lines will not only provide better experiences but also help supplement the currently understaffed hospital workforce.  On the surface, more online hours seems to give greater leniency to students whose universities havent had much luck placing them in hospitals. However, this flexibility can only take students so far when any number of hours still must be completed in-person.  Valerie Espinosa, a third-year nursing student, experienced an issue with her geriatrics class because of the coronavirus.  (For) my geriatrics course, ... I finished my 15 hours online but, unfortunately, the other 15 we cannot do in person because geriatrics are a vulnerable population, Espinosa said. So from my understanding, we are going to receive an incomplete, and we are going to do the in-person clinical hours we require fall quarter.  This change to the training requirements will only delay and disadvantage students like Espinosa, and depending on how long this pandemic lasts could impact their ability to graduate. And theres no guarantee hospitals will be ready to have students around vulnerable patient groups by fall quarter.  And if clinical hours get cut back further, the standard of education could fall with them.   According to a  study  performed by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing did not find that an online curriculum could entirely replace more traditional in-person hours.  Yue Ming Huang, an adjunct associate professor in the  UCLA anesthesiology and perioperative medicine  department, doesnt think virtual simulations should completely replace the more traditional methods for training future doctors and nurses.  So you can start off with the conceptual learning where theres lectures and discussions and thats all cognitive knowledge-based, but thats very beginning level,"" Huang said. ""Everyone understands what to do, but how do they actually show that they know how to put that knowledge into actual practice?  For people who are going into the medical field, general knowledge application is paramount. Its not just important to know how to diagnose a patient from afar, but its essential these health care professionals know how to apply their knowledge to save a patients life.  And applying that knowledge over the computer isnt nearly the same as doing so in person.  According to Huang, online clinical classes make use of drop-down menus to provide students with potential options. But people want to know their doctor or nurse is capable without a word bank before they arrive at the hospital.  Unfortunately, doctors and nurses working through school during this pandemic may not be as well trained in hands-on work as previous classes. In addition to more time online, some nursing students are having trouble being placed in training for the roles theyll want in the future.  Students arent in their preferred units all the time, said Dr. Mary Ann Shinnick, the director of the simulation and skills lab at the UCLA School of Nursing. For instance, the students who are getting ready to graduate, some of them actually wouldve normally gone into ICUs and of course that couldnt happen.  As advanced as these clinical simulations are, no amount of online training can prepare a student for working in an intensive care unit as well as hands-on experience can.  Obviously, we are in the middle of a pandemic, and putting students close to people with COVID-19 against their wishes would be irresponsible. No matter how beneficial in-person training may be, student safety comes first and putting students on the front lines without their consent would be unfair.  However, these arent just any students. These future nurses might want the opportunity to help during a time of crisis in the health care system  and ultimately, they worked their way to nursing school and should have access to the resources they signed up for if they want to opt-in.  Students are getting in-person hours in lower-risk departments, but that training won't help them if they're planning to work with vulnerable patients. Future doctors and nurses need a mix of hands-on experience and virtual training and it's crucial now that they receive it.  It might seem dangerous to allow someone to opt-in to clinical work in the middle of a pandemic.  But it's unfair not to give these students the option, and the understaffed health care system could certainly use the extra help.",['cap-mark-mcgreal'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/melanomapic.jpg

Josh Brahinsky, a continuing lecturer from UC Santa Cruz, said although the UC has recognized educators&#8217; work is crucial, it has not given them essential tools now that all UC instruction has moved online.  Such tools include stable internet access and a quiet space to teach, said Alison Black, a pre-continuing lecturer at UC San Diego.  Black said she struggles to find a space to teach without being interrupted by her toddler.  The UC Office of the President is working to provide lecturers with essential resources, including internet access and empty office space on campus, said Andrew Gordon, UCOP spokesperson, in an emailed statement.   However, UC-AFT president Mia McIver, a continuing lecturer at UCLA, said the reality is that most faculty members are not able to teach on campus, and UCOP has not provided adequate resources to teach at home.  &#8220;The idea that we can still teach on campus is absurd,&#8221; McIver said. &#8220;Many of us don&#8217;t have offices on campus, buildings are locked and traveling to be physically present on campus is forbidden in some areas. Even if it weren&#8217;t, teaching faculty cannot travel to campus without exposing themselves to possible infection.&#8221;  Katie Rodger, a continuing lecturer at UC Davis, has been teaching her online classes from a shed in her backyard. She said though her setup is not ideal, it is nicer than what some other lecturers have.   &#8220;We&#8217;re not just sitting here saying 'Give us better equipment&#8217; because we want nicer computers, or &#8216;I want faster Wi-Fi&#8217; for my own benefit,&#8221; Rodger said. &#8220;These are necessary tools.&#8221;  Beyond logistical and technological shortcomings, several union leaders said the UC has displayed a lack of empathy toward its faculty throughout the pandemic.  The UC usually gives instructors a full quarter to prepare to teach an online course, said Joy Hagen, a continuing lecturer at UCSC. With the switch to online instruction, however, instructors had just a few weeks to completely redesign their courses with little understanding or compensation from the UC, she said.  Additionally, the UC has made no protocol for what to do if a lecturer contracts COVID-19, Rodger said. That leaves a lot of the decisions up to individual departments, Rodger said.  &#8220;In my department at (UC) Davis, we have 60-plus full-time lecturers teaching writing, and they are desperately trying to stay healthy,&#8221; Rodger said.  Despite this, lecturers who have poor Wi-Fi connections at home are still encouraged to go to campus to use Wi-Fi there.  John Branstetter, a pre-continuing lecturer at UCLA, said the UC has made a no layoffs pledge until June 30, but for him, that does not mean much. Branstetter&#8217;s contract ends June 30, which means he will receive his last paycheck June 1 and lose his health insurance June 30.  &#8220;UC hasn&#8217;t made any effort to extend my contract, at least, through the summer so (that) I can count on health coverage during this really crazy time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They haven&#8217;t even made a decision of if I will be able to teach next year.&#8221;  Pre-continuing lecturers are lecturers who have taught less than 18 quarters or 12 semesters at a UC campus. As a pre-continuing lecturer, Branstetter said he has less rights than a continuing lecturer with regard to contract renewal  At UCLA, the teaching faculty turnover rate is 45%, which means almost half of the lecturers lose their jobs every year, McIver said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to teach classes, and I&#8217;m trying to do a good job for my students, but I&#8217;ve got this economic worry hanging over my head,&#8221; Branstetter said. &#8220;While the University goes around saying &#8216;We&#8217;ve done this great thing with no layoffs,&#8217; it&#8217;s completely empty for the majority of UC-AFT lecturers because our contracts expire May 30.&#8221;  UC-AFT would like to see the UC produce a comprehensive emergency response plan and contract extensions, but has been unsuccessful in receiving this from any UC campuses, McIver said.  &#8220;If the University of California wants to claim that it is the greatest research and educational institution in the world, it needs to now stand by that claim and implement the best infrastructure for online education,&#8221; Rodger said.

Dua Lipa looks to funk-filled musical influences from the '70s and '80s to make a modern statement in her latest album, &#8220;Future Nostalgia,&#8221; which was released Friday &#8211; a week earlier than expected after an  online leak . Old-school influences layered over contemporary production allow Lipa to create a rare type of pop album. It's one that plays upon nostalgic sounds but is also sure to incite nostalgia of its own in years to come.  The 11-track record owes much of its success to the pervasive disco-inspired instrumentation woven into each song. The titular &#8220;Future Nostalgia&#8221; sets the stage flawlessly, as synthesized rhythms and clap beats open the album. In the song's first line, the self-proclaimed female alpha makes her ambitions clear, singing, &#8220;You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game.&#8221;  And it&#8217;s safe to say that&#8217;s exactly what each of the following tracks does.  Lipa cooks up the perfect recipe for dance clubs everywhere with ""Hallucinate"" &#8211; a pulsing beat and synth drum provide the groundwork for the impending chorus. It soon builds up as new techno sounds move the song into an upbeat groove. Production pulls back during the bridge, only to make its eventual return even sweeter.   [Related:    Album review: The Weeknd authentically portrays heartache over past heartbreak in &#8216;After Hours&#8217;   ]   Faded, echoing beats make up the lead-in for &#8220;Break My Heart,&#8221; snapping into crisp focus moments later. But as Lipa begins to sing, they fade again, slowly building in intensity and clarity as her first verse drives faster and faster into the chorus. The song&#8217;s production comes to a climax as the singer wistfully wonders, &#8220;Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?&#8221; It then fades out, but the moment of silence expertly launches the track back into overdrive as Lipa decides not to let her lover go.    The '80s disco qualities aid &#8220;Future Nostalgia&#8221; in saving songs that might otherwise feel generic. Eerily wavering synthesized rhythms accent fifth track &#8220;Levitating&#8221; by mimicking   what it might sound like to float  . The intricately applied production makes less-than-perfect lyrics like &#8220;my sugarboo&#8221; infinitely more bearable &#8211; and even enjoyable. And a techno breakdown in later moments of the following &#8220;Pretty Please&#8221; adds a satisfying end to the slower track's journey.  But old-school pop is perfected in &#8220;Physical,&#8221; a track that could have easily been ripped from any one of the most popular '80s VHS workout tapes coveted by mothers everywhere. As a diamond hidden within an album full of gold, the song capitalizes on modern technology to deliver a level of sonic clarity that could only mark it as the latest and greatest in pushing musical boundaries.    The high-end nostalgic production on the LP could easily overshadow a lesser singer, but Lipa&#8217;s exceptional performance is comparably masterful. A sheer variety of vocal styles, from the almost-spoken verses of &#8220;Future Nostalgia&#8221; to the voice breaks in &#8220;Cool,&#8221;   showcase a range typically found in the works of seasoned professionals.  Raspy, wisplike vocals in &#8220;Cool&#8221; adorn the last syllable of almost every line of the track's chorus, as Lipa describes an intimate relationship.   Her execution conjures a suggestive mood similar to that of the later track &#8220;Good In Bed.&#8221;   [Related:    Album review: Niall Horan departs from typical acoustic ballads in emotional narrative record   ]   The gentle, airy notes of ""Good In Bed"" characterize the   verses, which question a relationship, while deeper vocal moments in the chorus confidently highlight the benefit of staying together: sex. Though the penultimate song lacks lyrical depth with comments like ""I dedicate this verse to (verse to)/ All that good pipe in the moonlight,"" the artist&#8217;s playful performance provides a suitable justification for the lines.  Most notable, however, is the lyrical messaging Lipa delivers during ""Future Nostalgia""'s most critical moments. As the final song, &#8220;Boys Will Be Boys&#8221; brings the album full circle by elaborating on the feminist theme of the opening track. Powerfully blunt lines like &#8220;If you&#8217;re offended by this song/ You&#8217;re clearly doing something wrong&#8221; refreshingly take over the narrative. Her approach provides clear commentary on the double standards surrounding gender roles and separates the artist from many others who shroud their messages in a vague mist.  Lead single &#8220;Don&#8217;t Start Now&#8221; hinted at Lipa's empowering message for females even before the album's release. In the aftermath of a failed relationship, the singer disregards her ex&#8217;s attempts to rekindle the fire with lyrics such as &#8220;I'm all good already/ So moved on, it's scary.&#8221; From the first glimpse she provided into the record, Lipa prepared listeners for an unconventional, unrestrained sound.  And she delivered. With relevant social themes laced into a funky throwback sound, &#8220;Future Nostalgia&#8221; offers a timely break from current trends. But the album could mark an invigorating new trend &#8211; if the music industry should be so lucky.

While COVID-19 patients could potentially develop neurological symptoms because of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for causing the disease, those without the disease may also be experiencing neurological effects, such as increased sleep disruption and vivid dreams, because of the psychological impacts of the lockdown.   Jennifer Martin, professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine, said non-peer-reviewed survey data has shown that people have reported an increase in distressing nightmares and frequent sleep disruptions during the lockdown.  The current pandemic and the general lockdown have people worrying about their families&#8217; well-being and their livelihoods, creating a highly stressful situation that can induce bad dreams, Martin said.  Martin said she considers the disruption to most people&#8217;s sleep schedules to be another source of the problem. People only remember their dreams if they wake up in the middle of a dream, and because people&#8217;s sleep schedules are altered, people tend to wake up during nightmares and remember them vividly, she said.  People struggling to sleep well tend to have more negative emotions throughout the day and may become worse at dealing with the emotions, which could result in high levels of stress, Martin said. Though infrequent vivid dreams are not problematic, repeated vivid and disturbing dreams can develop into a nightmare disorder, she added.  &#8220;We are concerned about the health care workers, the people in the trenches of this pandemic,&#8221; said Martin. &#8220;For them, nightmares can be a common symptom.&#8221;  People experiencing frequent nightmares can take steps to improve their sleep cycles such as avoiding stress-inducing news feeds, adopting a regular sleep routine and reminding oneself of pleasant events before going to bed, Martin said.  COVID-19 patients also report having vivid dreams, said Elyse Singer, director of the UCLA Neuro-Infectious Diseases Program. Singer said SARS-CoV-2 can infect the brain and cause a long list of neurological symptoms, including loss of smell, headache, delirium, seizure, muscle problems, meningitis, and cephalitis, however, there is insufficient clinical data to determine if these dreams are induced by the viral infection.  Loss of smell is a common symptom of COVID-19, which affects about a third of patients, Singer said. The virus infects the nasal tissue by binding its &#8220;spike protein"" from its viral shell to a type of enzyme receptor found in that tissue, and these receptors can be found in multiple organs, including the brain, she added.  Once the virus has infected the nerves in the nasal tissue, it can travel along the neural pathway to the brain, infecting the olfactory bulb and resulting in the loss of smell, Singer said.  COVID-19 patients also have an increased risk of stroke, said David Liebeskind, professor of neurology at the School of Medicine.  In some COVID-19 patients, natural blood thinners produced at the blood vessels&#8217; surfaces are tampered with, and the immune system produces substances that promote blood clotting as a part of its response to the virus, Liebeskind said. The viral infection also causes blood vessels to expand because of inflammation, which further facilitates clotting, resulting in an increased risk of stroke for patients, including young people who are usually not at risk, he said.  Studies of other viruses that infect the brain suggest that inflammation caused by viral infections could lead to chronic disorders, such as dementia, Singer said. However, since the disease is new, there is not yet enough data to determine the long-term effects SARS-CoV-2 can have on the nervous system, she added.  Formal studies are necessary to determine whether COVID-19 can cause lasting neurological damage, Liebeskind said.  &#8220;We only have the earliest manifestation for now,&#8221; said Liebeskind. &#8220;And we are concerned about the long-term implications.&#8221; ",['cap-zhichun-li'],"['news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/COVIDdream-1024x1024.png

Last Tuesday, I rolled out of bed to record the final episode of the ""Out of Bounds"" podcast for winter quarter. Former Sports editor Ryan Smith and assistant Sports editor Jack Perez showed up outside my door at 10:30 a.m., and we talked about UCLA men's basketball's prospects in the upcoming Pac-12 tournament, which could have secured them a spot in the NCAA tournament. I would be following the team to Las Vegas to cover the event for the Daily Bruin, and I had already booked a Thursday afternoon flight.  There were already hundreds of novel coronavirus cases in the United States , but there was no reason to think that would have any impact on the Bruins' &#8211; or my &#8211; trip to Sin City. Fifty hours until takeoff.   Later that afternoon, UCLA Athletics limited all upcoming on-campus events to essential personnel only. Pac-12s and NCAAs were still on, so my plans hadn't changed. Forty-five hours until takeoff.  On Wednesday, the Pac-12 limited tournament attendance to only players, coaches, press and other essential workers. I was credentialed press, so I still checked in for my flight and pulled out a suitcase to pack when I woke up the next morning. Nineteen hours until takeoff.  Then, the NBA suspended the rest of its season after a player tested positive for COVID-19. Eighteen hours until takeoff.  Thursday morning, the Pac-12 finally called off the remainder of its men's basketball tournament, following in the footsteps of the Big Ten Conference, Southeastern Conference and others. Four hours until takeoff &#8211; but my countdown didn't really matter anymore. Too much had changed in the last 48 hours.  When American Airlines flight 2307 finally left the ground at 1:04 p.m. on Thursday, I wasn't on board. Instead, I was still laying in bed, my eyes glued to Twitter, waiting for the last domino to fall.  Just 12 minutes after the flight I was supposed to be on went wheels up, it happened &#8211; the NCAA called off both the men's and women's basketball tournaments, and March Madness 2020 was no more.  I was hopeless, lethargic and lost. Sports are my life &#8211; my job, my hobby, my passion and hopefully, one day, my career &#8211; and I know I'm far from alone in that sense.  Everyone who had been relying on sports for entertainment, time-killing or income had it ripped away from them in a matter of days. And it had been taken away by a pathogen, invisible to the naked eye, but with effects very much visible, ruthless and devastating around the globe.  Sports and sports fans have always found a way to persevere. This time, I'm not so sure.  World wars, 9/11 and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing may have scared off fans, but sports became a way for communities to rally when times got tough. Think of Jesse Owens winning gold in front of Adolf Hitler at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Mike Piazza's go-ahead home run 10 days after the Twin Towers fell or the Boston Red Sox's ""Boston Strong"" World Series run seven years ago.  Sports have long been a way for people of all walks of life to come together and share moments of catharsis. As the world settles into varying degrees of quarantine, however, we won't have sports to comfort us when the going gets tough.  Playing as the Utah Jazz in NBA 2K20 doesn't feel right when the real-life Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert are infected with COVID-19. Watching SportsCenter and ESPN doesn't satisfy that need of escapism like it normally does, when all they have to talk about is the collapse of the sports world as we know it.  Scrolling through Twitter gives me a pit in my stomach, since almost every tweet is about the coronavirus and what normal life could have been like that day. I would have been in Vegas, watching Jaime Jaquez Jr., Chris Smith and company make a historic run at a Pac-12 title.  Instead, I have to settle for people sharing simulations on social media and ESPN's bracketology for a tournament that isn't even happening anymore.  The coronavirus and its effects reach far beyond the sports world, that much is clear. Thousands of people around the world are sick or have died already, countless industries are bleeding cash and hourly-wage workers have almost nowhere to turn.  But to anyone who says, ""It's just a game"" or ""Have some perspective"" &#8211; keep it to yourself. You clearly have never met a sports fanatic before.   To the athletes who were robbed of a chance at glory on the biggest stage, the sports anchors and freelance writers who are out of a job for the time being, and the countless men, women and children sitting at home with no escape &#8211; I know how you feel.  There was no way to prepare for this series of unprecedented effects, and the dominoes could continue to fall indefinitely. It's great that governing bodies are choosing to prioritize public health, but it's hard to take solace in that when our untouchable, unifying world of sports has been drowned out by a harsh reality for the first time ever.  It all just happened so fast, and there isn't anything we can do except wait. ",['cap-sam-connon'],"['sports', 'sports-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.unconnon.LK_.jpg

The extension will connect Westwood to Downtown Los Angeles by 2027. To expedite construction of the Wilshire/Rodeo station, the LA Metro and the City of Beverly Hills agreed to fully close Wilshire Boulevard between Beverly Drive and Crescent Drive for one to three months.  Low traffic resulting from the statewide safer-at-home orders made the closure feasible. This measure is estimated to reduce the construction timeline by up to six months.  Metro's contractors are considering potential options for expediting work during the COVID-19 pandemic safer-at-home orders mandated by the state and local governments, said Dave Sotero, a Metro spokesperson, in an emailed statement.  Sotero did not mention any concrete plans to close down any parts of Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood.  Business  stakeholders  in Westwood Village have previously expressed concern that the construction on Wilshire Boulevard could largely cut off customers from entering the Village. A shut down of Wilshire Boulevard along Westwood Village may soften the impact of construction without harming local businesses, which have been closed because of the pandemic.   The Wilshire/Rodeo station is a part of Section 2 of the Purple Line Extension. In Section 3, which is planned to be completed by 2027, Metro plans to construct one station underneath Wilshire Boulevard between Westwood Boulevard and Veteran Avenue and another near the West Los Angeles Veteran Affairs Medical Center.  To date, the coronavirus pandemic has had no effect on the project timeline, and construction work continues to be conducted according to schedule, Sotero said. Metro employees and contractors are heeding recommended social distancing protocols and wearing face masks, coverings and shields as established by the workers&#8217; employer, Sotero added.   The Purple Line Extension  received $1.3 billion of funding  from the United States Department of Transportation in February to finance the construction of the subway line extension to Westwood.

The fellowships will provide students with $2,500 a month for up to three months to continue their studies, research and other creative work over the summer, said Emily Carter, executive vice chancellor and provost, in the emailed statement.    Graduate students at UCLA    voted    Thursday to go on strike this week, pending approval of graduate students in at least 10 departments. Graduate students would stop teaching and grading until their demands of higher wages and affordable housing are met.    The UCLA move also follows protests and strikes from graduate students across the University of California for a cost of living adjustment.    Graduate students at UC Santa Cruz first held a strike in December in which they refused to turn in fall grades, before striking again in February. At least 17 students were arrested during protests in February. UC Santa Cruz    fired    54 students on Feb. 28 for continuing to refuse to turn in fall grades.    Carter said UCLA recognizes the rising costs, particularly of housing, that graduate students face in Los Angeles. While the fellowships are not a blanket resource for all graduate students, they will be available to students who do not have access to other opportunities for summer funding, she added.    UCLA strives to provide robust financial support for graduate students, however, we recognize that more needs to be done, particularly for students lacking support during the summer months to continue their scholarly work uninterrupted from the academic year, Carter said.    One of the goals of the fellowships is also to reduce time-to-degree, and allow students to graduate faster with less debt, Carter said.    UCLA is also working to create additional and lower-cost housing options for graduate students, with hundreds more living spaces that will become available in   fall 2020 and fall 2022, she added. The university is also looking to purchase new facilities to increase graduate student housing, she said.

More than once, actually.  The first time, as I&#8217;ve written (and talked) about dozens of times, was freshman year. I failed another introductory biology exam, and it was time for me to go. Time for me to pack away the camera, clock more hours in Powell and finish up recruiting for summer internships at local hospitals.  The second time was last year.  I sat with then-Photo editor Amy Dixon at the Kerckhoff patio. The blue hour light cast shadows &#8211; shadows so solemn they dimmed the rich, orange orbs spilling out of the coffee shop.  &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look too good,&#8221; Amy said.  My vision blurred, obscured by the tears building up in my eyes for perhaps the billionth time that day. Crying, literally spilling my emotions from my body and allowing the feelings to escape my heart, usually helps me cope.  But the pools of tears I left on my pillowcase, or in this case, the patio tables, could not discard the pain left in my body. Despite winning the staff&#8217;s endorsement, I was not appointed editor in chief &#8211; a decision so unprecedented the staff went on strike.  &#8220;No one is asking you to come back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t feel obligated to.&#8221;  I wrung my hands. Perhaps I could pursue internship opportunities at local news organizations during the school year, or finally spend a quarter studying in Washington, D.C. &#8211; all things being a contributor and editor at The Bruin for the three years leading up to my senior year prevented me from doing.  I didn&#8217;t mind, however, that the biggest portion of my resume detailed my contributions to The Bruin. I didn&#8217;t mind having @dailybruin as the only organization tagged on my Twitter profile. And I definitely didn&#8217;t mind devoting everything I had to this paper.  The Daily Bruin was everything to me.  Angry whispers, riddled with frustration and passive aggressive Slack messages flooding my notifications couldn&#8217;t dampen the love I held for this paper. Accusations contesting the merit of my own journalistic accolades could not shatter my perseverance. And even knowing that I could not  &#8211; no matter how sharp my photos were, how many retweets my posts gained or how compelling my stories read &#8211; earn respect from some of my colleagues, I held my head high and did my job the very best I could.  I tried to imagine my life without the dusty office chairs that created traffic jams in an overcrowded office, or the incessant chatter, a glorious symphony singing notes of investigations, shenanigans and the half-working printer, beating a constant drum accompanying my everyday.  I couldn&#8217;t imagine leaving my home base, the scrappy, leaky, room on the first floor of Kerckhoff where I never entered without seeing a smiling face.  Every time I tried to leave, something pulled me back.  I could go on about the endless opportunities I&#8217;ve received through this paper. The chance to photograph Taylor Swift not just once, but twice, and land a cameo in her Netflix documentary. An internship with The Washington Post, the very publication that sparked my interest in journalism during high school. Editors who sharpened my writing skills and taught me to think critically about the world around me.  I will certainly say my year as Digital Managing editor was the hardest in my three years of editorship. But it was also the most unforgettable.  I somewhat learned how to navigate the digital ocean, understanding servers and code deployment a little better than the average college student. I managed to prevent angry Airbnb owners from kicking 40 of my staff members out of their households, twice! And I skipped class to snag Taylor Swift tickets alongside other members of the #holy-ground in the office.  These are experiences I will carry, and relentlessly reminisce on, for the rest of my life.  But aside from flashy red carpet gigs or a sideline seat to nail-biting football games, I learned about myself through The Bruin. Yes, I prefer writing to mathematics, and I am most definitely not cut out for a career in STEM. But more intimately, I understood who I was &#8211; Asian American, Vietnamese &#8211; identities I&#8217;ve internalized but neglected to embody.  This paper isn&#8217;t perfect. The lack of diversity, in race and ethnicity, sexuality, income level and more, is devastating. The stipends offered and the amount of work required is almost despicable. And let&#8217;s not forget the toxic work environment that can exist.  But even with its flaws, the Daily Bruin is a force of good.  The council meetings that can feel like they drag on for eternity or the number of times InDesign crashes &#8211; these resentments are the price to pay for the privilege we hold. After all, the work inscribed in these very pages marks the first draft of history. We tell stories that move hearts and souls, stories that embolden change for the better.  The Daily Bruin is not perfect. But I still believe in it.  Perhaps it is the people that make Daily Bruin so great. After all, I wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;Krust&#8221; to anyone else. And there really is no one else in the world that would listen to my diatribes about digital journalism or allow me to hang a &#8220;Frozen&#8221; poster at my office desk.  There&#8217;s a whole list of people who have touched my life through this paper: Mitansh, Linda, Ed, Amy (B), Andrew, Angie, Joy, Axel, MacKenzie, Liz, Aileen, Christine, Tanmay, Kanishka, Niveda, Justin, Eli, Melissa, EJ, the online bros and the entire digital-first squad, thank you for being my favorite people in the world.

This is what democracy looks like, hundreds chanted back.    The protesters gathered near the Wilshire Federal Building on Saturday to protest against police brutality and racial discrimination. The Islamic Circle of North America Council for Social Justice, a Muslim civil rights advocacy group, organized the protest.    The ICNA CSJ protest followed more than a week of similar protests across the globe after George Floyd died May 25 in Minneapolis police custody. Hundreds of students and LA residents protested near the Wilshire Federal Building on    Monday    and on the UCLA campus Thursday.    [Related link:    Hundreds gather at UCLA to protest police brutality, racial injustice   ]    Protesters lined the streets near Wilshire Boulevard and Veteran Avenue on Saturday afternoon, interrupting traffic and carrying signs that read, Black lives matter, and I cant breathe.   https://twitter.com/ijfortier/status/1269404984807849984?s=20   Hundreds of supporters on motorcycles and in   cars drove down Wilshire Boulevard, wearing shirts emblazoned with BLM, raising their fists in the air and honking as they went by.    The crowd near the Wilshire Federal Building then knelt for a moment of silence for victims of police brutality. Afterward, hundreds of protesters raised their signs and shouted chants, including No justice, no peace, and Hands up, dont shoot.&nbsp;    The crowd marched eastward down Wilshire Boulevard toward Westwood Plaza at around 4 p.m. and then back westward to Sepulveda Boulevard. At both intersections, the crowd knelt for several minutes in memory of Floyd.&nbsp;   [caption id=""attachment_385136"" align=""alignleft"" width=""620""]  Protesters lie face down at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Veteran Avenue in protest of police violence and racial discrimination. (Amy Dixon/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]   In anticipation of the ICNA   CSJ protest, several California Highway Patrol cars closed Interstate 405 freeway ramps near Westwood. Protesters had    marched    onto the I-405 at Mondays protest. LAPD officers also blocked traffic at intersections near the protest, including at Wilshire Boulevard and Gayley Avenue.    Black leaders made up about a quarter of the protests organizing group, said Saad Bholat, an administrative assistant for the ICNA   Southern California Chapter. The organizers worked independently of other Black community organizations to plan the event, Bholat added.    Many of us, despite our commitment to the principles of solidarity and allyship, will never know what it is like to be Black in this country, read an ICNA CSJ    statement   .&nbsp;    The U.S. Department of Homeland Security stationed two officers in front of the Wilshire Federal Building. The LA County Sheriffs Department and the Santa Monica Police Department deployed several cars on standby in a nearby parking lot.    Several protesters noted the relative lack of interaction between law enforcement and protesters compared to similar protests across the city this week.&nbsp;    Aurianna Angelique, one of the protesters, said she didnt plan on speaking at the event, but began leading chants when given a microphone.    Were still waiting for justice for Breonna Taylor; we're still waiting for justice for Ahmaud Arbery,   Angelique said. This is just the beginning, I don't think people understand. This is not just a protest here and there for a couple of lives. This is a movement.    Margaret Koldinger, a third-year theater student at UCLA who attended the protest, said she was inspired to participate by other theater students who had already participated in several protests against police brutality.&nbsp;    Ive heard a lot of comments from my friends, my fellow theater majors, saying how tired they are having to fight for their own rights, Koldinger said. I just wanted to pick up the banner a little bit and try (to) do what I can to take the weight off their shoulders.    Mercy Brown and Taylor Mitchell said they joined the ICNA CSJ protest after attending a similar protest in Inglewood earlier Saturday.    We love to see all the people out here, all the people that this is affecting, because its a community thing, its affecting us all, Brown said.    About half of Westwood Village businesses installed barricades over their storefronts ahead of protests this week because of concerns of looting. Andrew Thomas, executive director of the Westwood Village Improvement Association, said several businesses are planning to begin removing barricades next week.    Angelique said that she had never seen so many young people protesting for civil rights.    We have never seen so many allies in history that are backing us up, and I think this is what's going to change this country, Angelique said.

No one at UCLA has tested positive so far.  The three UCLA students are being tested by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said Chancellor Gene Block in an email sent to students early Friday morning. The department has committed to expediting these tests for UCLA, according to Blocks email.  The LACDPH has not recommended to suspend campus operations or cancel classes, Block added.  In a statement released Wednesday, Block said UCLA administrators are looking to stream more lectures online and may provide options for remote test-taking because of COVID-19.  UCLA is also increasing its precautions by installing hand sanitizer stations around campus and using antiviral chemical solutions to clean public areas.  The news comes after the state of California declared a  state of emergency  Wednesday, following the first confirmed novel coronavirus-related death in the state.  The LACDPH announced Thursday there are currently 11 people in LA County infected by COVID-19, although all were exposed to a known source.  The LACDPH announced two new positive cases, increasing the total LA count to 13, at a press conference Friday. Around 50 tests have been run across LA County, and many results have been negative, said Barbara Ferrer, the director of LACDPH, at the press conference.  The students were tested because health providers determined they may have shown COVID-19 symptoms or may have been exposed, she added.  Four people who tested positive are currently in the hospital, she said.  One of the cases is currently being monitored by the Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center, according to  CBS Los Angeles .  Gov. Gavin Newsom also  announced  California has ordered a declaration that would make health insurance companies waive out-of-pocket costs for coronavirus testing.  UCLA administrators released updated travel restrictions Thursday, which barred university travel to all regions with Level 3 travel warnings, including mainland China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. UCLA also discouraged nonessential international travel.  The University of California has also suspended spring study abroad programs in China, South Korea and Italy.  Although classes have not been canceled, several events scheduled to occur on the UCLA campus have been canceled because of COVID-19 concerns.  The Farhang Foundation  announced  Wednesday that it will be cancelling Nowruz celebrations scheduled to occur on UCLAs campus Sunday.  UCLA Athletics said meet-and-greets with UCLA athletes have been canceled until further notice, although athletic competitions will continue as scheduled, according to a  statement released Wednesday .  The  LA Marathon , which will pass through Westwood, has not been cancelled, although LACDPH has released guidelines for spectators to avoid contracting COVID-19.  UCLA will be hosting a meeting Monday to address student and faculty inquiries on COVID-19.  Additionally, UCLA Newsroom has released an  information page  about the new coronavirus.

Spencer Beck, a third-year English and psychology student, founded the newest incarnation of UCLAs Disney Club this year as she said she wanted its   magic to be present on campus. After searching for an existing Disney Club during her freshman and sophomore years, she said she discovered the club has been inactive since 2016. After months of preparation, Beck said   she decided to restart the Disney Club during this past winter quarter to have a place where UCLA students can share their love of Disney with others.  I decided to take the challenge and I'm super passionate about Disney, so I thought it would be a really fun way to get more involved on campus and make more friends, Beck said.   [Related:    A quick guide to some of Disney+s original content   ]   From guest speakers to presentations, Beck educates students on all aspects of Disney that could be used in their professional lives. One notable guest speaker was Joshua Rush from Disney Channels Andi Mack, who used his celebrity status to discuss voting rights and encourage UCLA students to let their voices be heard in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.  In addition to activism, Beck said she and the other club officers give presentations about the Disney company as a whole. On Wednesday, former Imagineer Terri Hardin and Cinde Fortino, founder of the annual Be Our Guest dinner, spoke to students about their roles in the Disney corporation, as well as provided advice to students interested in working for the company. A key member in planning these events and meetings is   Kristen Abernathy, second-year biology student and the clubs internal vice president, and one meeting in particular stood out to her.  We had a meeting about how Disney and Pixar concepts evolve from concept to what you actually see in the movie theater, and I thought it was really interesting because I've always loved those really big Disney coffee table art books,"" Abernathy said. ""It was really cool to be with people who also had that weird enthusiasm.""  Contrary to the expectation that a new club would struggle as a result of the current pandemic, the Disney Club has flourished.   From the success of its   social media pages, Beck said the club has gained many new followers and keeps current members engaged through events such as Disney movie nights and biweekly general meetings Wednesdays via Zoom. In order to attract students to participate in these virtual meetings and events, Paige Brunson, first-year design media arts student and the club's graphics artist, designs graphics to portray the club's lively atmosphere.  We wanted to go for a vintage vibe for our logo, so we used the original Disneyland sign that used to be outside, and I just made another graphic that will be used for virtual Bruin Day that will help promote the club, Brunson said.   [Related:    Recent Rewinds: Curation of family-friendly Disney+ content shows potential flaws, hypocrisy   ]   While the club is continually brainstorming strategies to attract UCLA students, Beck said she has been able to take advantage of the new online format   to engage and connect with Disney lovers not just at UCLA but across the country.   After first connecting with local Disney clubs at Chapman University and California State University, Northridge, Beck said she was able to expand nationally and come in contact with clubs in Arizona, Hawaii, Florida and New Jersey, allowing UCLA students to be able to communicate with a wide range of people while quarantined at home.   Now, the Disney Clubs   virtual events and meetings are open to anyone who wants to share their love of Disney with others, Beck said.  I think it's important that we have a space where people can talk and have a sense of community and not feel so isolated during this time, Beck said.  &nbsp;",['cap-allyson-weissman'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/My_Man_Mickey.jpg

Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19 , is a respiratory disease that can spread from human to human and has grown to more than 3,000 cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   On March 10, UCLA announced it was suspending in-person classes and moved finals and lectures online, encouraging students to go home.   UCLA  has more than 40,000 students, many of whom live permanently on the Hill. With various classes, club meetings and dining options crammed onto the smallest UC campus, public health is a critical issue that, when put at risk, can threaten students well-being. It's hard to see any certainty amid a global panic  but this serves as a cautionary tale for how to address safety moving forward.  And that starts with what UCLA did wrong.      The current UCLA Newsroom website's coronavirus page is a rapid and effective first step to keep students informed. But it also lacks the educational information for students to learn and understand the virus.   Xenophobia  has been one consequence of the outbreak. Many Asian people have received various levels of discrimination.  Meanwhile, students are also afraid to miss classes since many professors do not upload notes online.  Increasing the focus on education and actively providing public information about the virus and its social implications would have been integral to increasing mitigation.  This virus didn't just come with a fever and respiratory symptoms  it came with harmful stereotypes as well.  As a result of COVID-19, there has been strong cultural stigmatization associated with Asians and face masks, with incidents such as racist bullying, according to an  NPR report .  Mimi Giang, a fourth-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student, said she wears masks to take responsibility for herself and others but received strange looks from people.  I think the school should be taking a lot more steps to properly educate the student body about the coronavirus,"" Giang said. ""And I think that there's a lot of misinformation, which causes panic.  A more comprehensive online module explaining the idea of a pandemic, how to prevent and avoid stigmatization and how to wear face masks effectively, at worst, would not harm anyone.  And at best, it could have prevented misinformation early on.  Before the eruption of the coronavirus, the seasonal flu had a long history of harming students. Around 22,000 to 55,000 people in the U.S. died from 2019-2020 flu season according to the  CDC . Avoiding skin contacts always prevents certain diseases from spreading, including the flu. More hand sanitizer stations and mandated gloves for dining service employees is a sanitary measure we are taking now, but they should have been required in the first place before the virus eruption.  ""It's always good to be hygienic and to be sanitary,"" said Leonardo Le Merle, a second-year biology student. ""I noticed personally I have become a lot of more aware of touching my hands (with my face or mouth).""  Moving forward, UCLA should maintain these healthy standards after controlling the coronavirus to protect more Bruins.  Fortunately, there's work to be done moving forward. The last key issue is the lack of online integration as the university moves toward an off-campus future. Before the spread of the disease, the predominant way to get online recordings was via  BruinCast , a service provided by the UCLA Center For the Advancement of Teaching for students to access lecture recordings online.  Steven Peterson, a lecturer in the communication department, posts his notes online to give students extra help.  I think for conditions like a virus, it is a good option to use online tools to continue the education process without the risk of spread disease, Peterson said.  While research has shown online recording does not decrease students attending in-person lectures, according to the BruinCast website, the website admits to its limits.  With a school the size of UCLA, employing BruinCast ubiquitously will no doubt cost resources. But the university should encourage faculty to record lectures on their own and post lecture notes online so students who are sick have the option to go home without worrying about missing classes. Professors faced difficulties switching to online classes because of a lack of training and sudden change, and UCLA should further train faculty to prepare for the spring quarter.  It is really tricky because it puts me in a strange position where I feel like I need to show up to lecture and put others at risk because there is no makeup policy, Giang said.  One counter-argument, Peterson points out, is that in-person education gives students the ability to have richer conversations than online education. Therefore, online tools and recordings shall serve as a supplement for learning during normal, healthy conditions.  Surely, there's no alternative for the in-classroom experience we all want. But right now, when no other choice is near, the least UCLA can do is make sure it makes the best of the situation  while learning from its past downfalls.  By implementing new standards and learning from its past, UCLA will stand through not only the seasonal flu, but various large-scale issues.  Bruins will continue to aim for straight-A's on their finals, as long as UCLA can pass public health 101 with flying colors.

Launched on April 6, brand-new streaming service Quibi  short for Quick Bites  boasts easily digestible content and features many original TV series with episodes shorter than 10 minutes in length. Reminiscent of services like YouTube and Netflix, Quibi adds to the plethora of entertainment families have at their disposal with mandatory quarantine measures in effect. However, while it doesnt have too much to offer as a stand-alone application, it can be an effective tool to gauge audience interest and conduct market research or serve as a creative outlet.  Quibi is available exclusively on mobile devices, priced at $4.99 per month with advertisements or $7.99 per month without ads. Unable to integrate multiple users onto a single account like Netflix, Quibi provides an individualized experience to the user and prevents password-sharing and shared accounts. One of its most advertised features is how users can seamlessly transition from a horizontal view to a vertical view, with different angles and camera shots presented on both  however, it's the platform's content that's the most interesting.   [Related:    A quick guide to some of Disney+s original content   ]   It hosts a variety of original shows including a reboot of the popular 2000s show ""Punkd,"" Chrissys Court, location-oriented news snippets and a pasta-making documentary series entitled Shape of Pasta. And yet, the extremely short runtimes do the shows an injustice as the simple narratives are unable to be fully fleshed out, resulting in a product that is more akin to clips or highlights from an actual show instead of a   complete storyline.  So while Quibis shows and features are unique to its application, the general feel of the app seems like an amalgamation of Netflix and YouTubes content.  Similar to   Netflix  , Quibis shows are aesthetically pleasing and have a whole cast and crew working toward creating the content  much like a regular film or TV show. But despite a high production value and A-list celebrities, the   content is more similar to that of specific YouTube conglomerates including BuzzFeed and Vice.  The only difference?   These YouTube channels and their sub-channels produce great quantities of serial videos covering a similar array of pop culture topics  without charging the user a penny.  Upon its launch, Quibi sought to provide these short pieces of entertainment that could be watched while on lunch breaks, waiting in lines or simply as a means of passing 10 minutes quickly. While this original purpose seemed promising and valuable for a society that is getting busier, more individualistic   and fast-paced, Quibi can only seem counteractive in adjusting to life under tight quarantine restrictions.  With the spread of COVID-19 and its effects on society, depth and substance is what's needed during times of uncertainty when people are meant to be putting society under a microscope  . The majority of the population has an overwhelming amount of unprecedented free time allowing them to consume entertainment in larger and lengthier quantities.  A simple activity to bring family members together, watching entertainment in groups also allows for a greater sense of community. Quarantined in their homes, families are likely   looking for entertainment that they can watch not only together but on a larger screen  this shared experience is one that Quibi cant offer.   [Related:    Recent Rewinds: Curation of family-friendly Disney+ content shows potential flaws, hypocrisy   ]   Quibi does have some promising implications, however. It could prove to be an integral tool in which people can channel their creativity in a much smaller and low-stakes environment. Instead of trying to pitch shows to rigid networks or trying to receive massive amounts of funding, the brevity of each Quibi series allows creators to take more creative risks while still putting out professional content.  The low-stakes environment is not only beneficial to creators, however. Networks could use Quibi as a tool in order to monitor how specific shows and topics are being received by the public, thus dictating what kinds of shows or films should be produced on a larger budget.   But while this paves the way for some entertaining shows on Quibi, it certainly doesn't seem worth the price or energy spent looking at devices when longer pieces of content pose much more thought-provoking questions in a time of a global pandemic.  True fans of entertainment would already know where to look to find similar content on the world's plethora of streaming services  for double the price but perhaps triple the quality.",['cap-natalie-brown'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ae_.quibi_.secondtake.TS_.jpg

The letter, signed by 30 current players  including incoming junior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson  expresses doubt over the programs ability to support the student-athletes under these circumstances with mandatory training looming July 6.    Time and time again, we see individuals within Athletic programs who ought to defend and protect us, leave us in the dark to fend for ourselves, the letter said. Starting with neglected and mismanaged injury cases, to a now mismanaged Covid-19 pandemic, our voices have been continuously muffled, and we will no longer stand for such blatant injustices.    When the team returns for mandatory workouts, the letter demands a third-party health official to be present to enforce health and safety guidelines during mandatory workouts.&nbsp;    The players also call for whistleblower protections for both athletes and coaches who wish to report violations of said guidelines without repercussions such as loss of scholarship or retaliation from members of the coaching staff.    The letter states that if the demands are not met, the players will withdraw from all promotional events for the program.&nbsp;    These demands reflect our call for an environment in which we do not feel pressured to return to competition, and if we choose not to return, that our decision will be respected, the letter said.  &nbsp;    This public action comes after former defensive end Elijah Wade  who medically retired from football this spring and is now a general representative on the Undergraduate Students Association Council  passed a resolution that aimed to provide better protection for student-athletes upon their return to campus. Wade is also listed as an author on the letter.    In response to the letters publication, Thompson-Robinson tweeted that the majority of the players in the program talked about the demands, but only the 30 players were willing to put their names on it publicly.    According to a report from The Athletics Bruce Feldman, new athletics director Martin Jarmond and coach Chip Kelly met with the team to discuss the letter.&nbsp;    Jarmond said in a tweet that the team grew from the conversation.&nbsp;    Candid and healthy dialogue with @UCLAFootball student athletes, coaches and staff today, Jarmond said in the tweet. We have addressed some concerns that were shared and will continue to encourage communication. We got better today.    On Wednesday, UCLA Athletics announced that football players will be allowed back on campus June 22 as part of phase one of its four-phase Return to Training process.    UCLA Athletics did not respond to requests for comment on the situation. ",['cap-jon-christon'],"['football', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/breaking.AL_.jpg

The journey begins in a classroom decorated with inspirational posters and baby pink lighting based on Spears' first music video, ""...Baby One More Time."" Following a mock-informational video in which the teacher from the original music video shares The Zone's rules and expectations, a bell signifies the end of class.  This strut through school continues into a hallway lined with interactive lockers, leading to a gym where fans can write letters to Spears &#8211; some of which have been featured on her Instagram. The creators' deep level of planning is evident through championship banners representing Spears' career achievements. A scoreboard displaying 38-2 &#8211; as a nod to the singer's age and kids &#8211; seamlessly transports visitors into a world dominated by Spears Easter eggs and aesthetics.  The high level of production and attention to detail is present in most of the rooms. Unforgettable Spears moments, including the ""Circus"" and ""Toxic"" music videos and her always relevant MTV Video Music Awards ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" performance, rightfully garner the most lavish sets of the pop-up. The iconic mile-high club depicted in ""Toxic"" is reimagined as a neon pink airplane interior, embellished with ""Toxic"" barf bags, safety sheets starring Spears and blue stewardess hats.

An omnipresent snake weaves through the thickets of greenery, while ominous lighting and waterfalls thicken the mood. The ultimate cherry on top is a boomerang moment in which caged visitors drape a stuffed snake over themselves.   However, The Zone creators certainly did not save the best for last, as the room based on ""Circus"" was a middle stop on the tour. As the largest room of all, it features an oversized ball pit perfect for playful TikToks. Its red interior and fair attractions, including ring toss, provide the feel of a big tent carnival. Its immense size and whimsical ornamentation envelop the senses in flirtatious and Spears-filled fun.

Instead of recreating the futuristic party scene from ""Stronger,"" creators pursued the other half of the music video in which Spears dances with a chair in a black room. While it is sexy when Spears does it, this simple concept does not offer much interaction or feasting for the eyes like other rooms.  The ""Blackout"" room represents Spears' fifth studio album and conveys the cult following of this record through a sanctuary setup. The handful of cheeky details, including a confessional that lights up as you kneel and LED candles that extinguish when blown, fail to make up for the formulaic design. Rooms based on ""Me Against The Music"" and ""Oops!...I Did it Again"" have noteworthy Instagram moments, but their moderate execution is nothing to write home about.    [Related:    Pop-up review: WonderWorld&#8217;s display of whimsy lives up to world down the rabbit hole   ]    Instagram and Twitter feeds are sure to gush at the curated content moments, but that's where The Zone's innovation stops. Most pop-ups, like the Museum of Ice Cream, center around a concept that does not easily provoke contemplation. But Britney Spears' career and personal life offer endless opportunities that The Zone shies away from. A room dedicated to Spears' relationship with Justin Timberlake or a photo gallery of articles detailing her 2007 meltdown would have evoked the drama missing from the tour.  The addition of rooms investigating Spears' biggest headlines through her personal commentary or interviews could offer a deeper look into Spears as a person, not as a pop star. The Zone misses out on providing an uncommon experience in which guests leave with a new perspective on the subject alongside cute content for their social feed.

Columnist Alissa Evans puts her cognitive science degree to use in Silver Screen Psychology, comparing movies and shows that boast accurate depictions of mental health to those that sacrifice authenticity for drama.     Warning: minor spoilers ahead   People with schizophrenia are not the violent killers movies often make them out to be.  They are actually very rarely dangerous, said Keith Nuechterlein, a distinguished professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences and of Psychology. Nuechterlein, also the director of UCLA&#8217;s first-episode psychosis clinic Aftercare Research Program, said accurate depictions   of the symptoms and behaviors associated with schizophrenia would elicit more empathy for people living with the disorder. But instead, popular films like &#8220;Shutter Island,&#8221; &#8220;The Visit&#8221; and &#8220;The Uninvited&#8221; may reinforce stereotypes by depicting characters with schizophrenia as unpredictable murderers.  &#8220;The problem is that those scary, horror-filmlike portrayals somehow are appealing to ...   the general public,&#8221; Nuechterlein said. &#8220;So there's a temptation to emphasize those aspects even though they're quite unrealistic.&#8221;   [Related:    Silver Screen Psychology: Looking into the ways movies, TV shows depict depression   ]   In reality, Nuechterlein said people with schizophrenia may experience auditory hallucinations, delusional beliefs or  , in rare cases, a tendency to speak or write in unintelligible sentences. These symptoms of psychosis may also be accompanied by negative symptoms, which refer to some type of deficit in normal mental function. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia may include flat affect &#8211; a decrease in a person&#8217;s range of emotions &#8211; or inertia, a lack of energy and motivation, Nuechterlein said. People with schizophrenia are often passive and are more likely to be violent toward themselves than others, he said.  But a passive, nonviolent character does not make for dramatic cinema &#8211; at least not in Hollywood&#8217;s eyes. In &#8220;Shutter Island,&#8221; Teddy's implied schizophrenia is used as a plot device to further the film's central mystery and to paint him as an uncontrollable madman. He experiences vivid hallucinations and becomes increasingly dangerous as he investigates a patient's disappearance from a psychiatric hospital.  According to one  study , Teddy commits a total of nine acts of violence against others throughout the film. Similarly, the characters with schizophrenia in &#8220;The Visit&#8221; and &#8220;The Caveman's Valentine&#8221; are violent toward others 10 and 13 times respectively. Such frightening cinematic portrayals partially explain why up to  80%  of the general public believe people with schizophrenia may act violently, according to Scientific American.   However, the reality is that most people with schizophrenia do not exhibit physically aggressive behaviors. In fact, people with schizophrenia are up to  14 times  more likely to be victims of violence rather than perpetrators.   [Related:    Movie review: &#8216;Tigertail&#8217; offers intimate look into family relationships across generations   ]   Despite the prominence of violent depictions of schizophrenia, not all films rely on the trope. Nuechterlein said &#8220;A Beautiful Mind&#8221; did a service to those with the disorder by illustrating how wholeheartedly John Nash believes in his delusions and by spotlighting the importance of his wife&#8217;s support.   With the definition of psychosis as a temporary inability to distinguish reality from delusion, the film excelled in portraying this disconnect without painting Nash as deranged or homicidal.  Yet even &#8220;A Beautiful Mind&#8221; is not perfect. Although visual hallucinations &#8211; like Nash&#8217;s nonexistent roommate and his imagined government supervisor &#8211; can occur, Nuechterlein said the hallucinations associated with schizophrenia are usually auditory. Because of its emphasis on visual phenomena, the film is not a fully accurate representation of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, Nuechterlein believes because film is a visual medium, the cinematic choice ultimately does not undermine the film&#8217;s success.  &#8220;If the overall effect is to show that someone with schizophrenia becomes entirely preoccupied with this other reality, it's sort of a visual tool they're using,&#8221; Nuechterlein said. &#8220;It'd be nice if they didn't have to do that, but it is more difficult to have a character be fully engaging for the audience if you stick with auditory phenomena.&#8221;  Visual hallucinations are also a tool in &#8220;Horse Girl&#8221; &#8211; a recent Netflix film &#8211; that communicate the main character&#8217;s increasingly skewed perception of reality. The film dives so deeply into the mind of Sarah, a shy craft store worker, that it never confirms whether her beliefs about cloning and alien abductions are actually delusions.  But Sarah&#8217;s grandmother had schizophrenia, and Nuechterlein said there is a strong genetic component to the disorder. Despite her predisposition to schizophrenia, her delusions and presumed hallucinations of spaceships and aliens, Sarah is not violent. Her experience with what is inferred to be schizophrenia is never exploited for shock value &#8211; it is a scary and confusing spiral, and the audience is meant to sympathize with her, not fear her. It's a refreshing take that could indicate a shift in how the mental illness will be depicted in film moving forward.  Sympathetic portrayals of schizophrenia can help lessen people&#8217;s fear and misunderstanding of the disorder, Nuechterlein said. Films like &#8220;Horse Girl&#8221; and &#8220;A Beautiful Mind&#8221; do not use schizophrenia as a plot gimmick, nor do they suggest all people with schizophrenia are killers. Instead, they sensitively explore the emotional complexities of psychosis, thereby dispelling the harmful idea that people with schizophrenia &#8211; or any psychotic disorder &#8211; are merely &#8220;crazy.&#8221;  &#8220;(The term crazy) doesn't encourage empathy for the person with the disorder,&#8221; Nuechterlein said. &#8220;It leads to more stigma that is misplaced.&#8221; ",[],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ae_.silverscreenpsychology2.courtesy.jpg
315,/2020/04/13/efforts-to-aid-those-experiencing-homelessness-must-persist-after-covid-19-pandemic/,309.0,299.0,157,260.0,0.9346,0.8706,$0.00,Efforts to aid those experiencing homelessness must persist after COVID-19 pandemic,https://dailybruin.com/2020/04/13/efforts-to-aid-those-experiencing-homelessness-must-persist-after-covid-19-pandemic/,"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 01:33:35 +0000",Camayak_b027827008," Stay at home, stock up on goods and perform basic hygiene regularly &#8211;  this is the common refrain   during the COVID-19 pandemic.   But   when there's no home to go to, no   reliable access to food and no stockpile of sanitizer, those rules quickly become difficult to follow.   In 2019, there were  58,936 individuals experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County and 36,300 in the City of LA  itself, according to the LA Times.   The coronavirus pandemic is a huge concern, considering this population's inconsistent access   to basic needs.   Since the coronavirus outbreak began to affect day-to-day life in LA, organizations supporting populations of people experiencing homelessness had to kick their operations into overdrive &#8211; and they've made commendable progress. Unfortunately, their action   was necessary because of the city's failure to better address homelessness before the pandemic began.   Now that coronavirus is here indefinitely,   the city has   started taking serious action,   including  sheltering people in hotels  that were previously unused and  establishing hand-washing stations  at major   homeless encampments throughout LA.   Although it is hard to find much to celebrate during the pandemic, one silver lining may be a more humanistic approach to homelessness. The current pandemic we are all battling may be able to act as a catalyst for mitigating   the problem of homelessness that LA has faced for years. These additional resources could have been enacted before the pandemic even began &#8211; but now that they're here, lawmakers must institutionalize these changes in order to serve these individuals better in the future.     Change seems to be coming in these dire times, and while LA's problem of homelessness is not a new concern, solutions need to persist long after the pandemic ends.  Even student organizations were playing their parts before having stepped up during the coronavirus outbreak to help people experiencing homelessness.  Bruin Shelter, a student-run volunteer organization helping to provide shelter for students   experiencing homelessness in the greater LA area, had adapted its procedures to maintain care, while also keeping volunteers and students healthy.  Many UCLA students have left campus, causing Bruin Shelter to see a decrease in volunteers to maintain its operations.   &#8220;We hired full-time resident assistants to be able to stay at the shelter 24/7 so we&#8217;re not constantly switching volunteer staff in and out to limit the transmission,&#8221; said Kathleen Len, the external vice president of Bruin Shelter and a fourth-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student.   Len said she has noticed a spotlight on the inadequacies that exist for populations of people experiencing homelessness and she hopes the attention being drawn to these issues will cause those in power to find solutions.   But more resources are needed to aid an entire city's homeless population.   In order to aid the community in this troubling time, the LA City Council   has given the North Westwood Neighborhood Council additional money for assistance, specifically for the connection between homelessness and the coronavirus, said Michael Skiles, the president of the NWWNC.  Skiles has already allocated most of the money to inject a much-needed boost for many of Westwood&#8217;s residents. Of the original $1,000 allocated to them to deal with COVID-19 and homelessness, $750 was spent on grocery runs to provide food and toiletries to those living on the streets. Once an additional $4,000 was made available, he donated $1,000 each to the Community Programs Office Food Closet, the Westwood Recreation Center&#8217;s temporary homeless shelter and the Westwood Village Improvement Association for hygiene and snack packs and discounts for local   health care workers&#8217; lunches.  &#8220;We&#8217;re able to do more when we&#8217;ve got great partner organizations who are on the ground already connecting with people, already helping people,&#8221; Skiles said. &#8220;A little bit of money can make these existing projects go a lot further.&#8221;   It is only after this crisis began that the city started to take action to assist those who may need it most, with seemingly simple fixes. But it is in the city council's best interests to continue this aid long after the coronavirus is dealt with.   Safe Parking LA, a project that allows for those sleeping in their vehicles to stay overnight in secure lots, is another organization stepping up to mitigate the spread of coronavirus to vulnerable populations.  Scott Sale, the executive director of Safe Parking LA, said they have been more careful in the wake of the pandemic.     For those most at risk in its services, Sale said they have been able to find shelter in hotels and motels. This elderly population is about 15% to 20% of Safe Parking LA&#8217;s total clients.   &#8220;It&#8217;s been impressive that the city and county went out of their way along with the state,&#8221; Sale said.  But prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the  stagnation  in building affordable housing for people experiencing homelessness was anything but impressive.     One could argue most of the attention and resources are not being funneled to the populations of people experiencing homelessness quickly enough to make a difference. Instead, the priority has been toward a stimulus package to the nation and its businesses. However, this is a step in the right direction to aiding populations of people experiencing homelessness and demonstrating that resources for those in need matter now more than ever. People are taking on a communal mindset during this outbreak, which is allowing for more solutions to come to fruition.  It's a mindset that must last after this pandemic.   Even without a home, plentiful food and sanitations, there are those trying to provide some sense of comfort and care for one of the most at-risk groups. Now it looks as though the city's priorities are changing.  But if LA will continue to change them in the right direction is another question.

Because of the shutdown of schools and nonessential businesses following the outbreak of COVID-19, hospitals and medical schools imposed restrictions on who would be allowed to continue involvement in day-to-day hospital activities.  In a statement issued by the  Association of American Medical Colleges  last month, medical students are not permitted to engage in direct patient care, unless there is an urgent need. The deans of the David Geffen School of Medicine held their own  town hall  to discuss medical school student outcomes and to determine how best to move forward.  First- and second-year medical students spend much of their time in the classroom, with added opportunities for physician shadowing and preceptorship experience, where students are assigned to a doctor who trains and  mentors them throughout the year, said Simone Renault, a third-year medical student. Third- and fourth- years are mainly in the hospital.  First-year medical students, currently studying the interaction between muscles and skeletal structures, have had to adjust to online anatomy class. Medical school anatomy classes demand accurate recognition of muscles, structures and bones on cadavers in in-person lab session settings.  Elena Stark, an anatomy professor at the School of Medicine, has transitioned anatomy instruction online using detailed images of cadavers in her lessons. Optional anatomy labs will also be made available at the end of summer or the beginning of fall, said Vice Dean for Education Clarence Braddock.  In their first year, medical students are also matched with preceptors, practicing physicians in Los Angeles County willing to participate in elective mentorship and shadowing, said Mariam Khan, a first-year medical student at the School of Medicine.  However, preceptorship and clinical skills assessments have since been moved online, Khan said.  &#8220;There is so much to be taken away from in-person learning and the ability to be supervised and corrected in real time,&#8221; Khan said.  Second-year medical students did not experience the same transition to online learning, as they are preparing for the  United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 .  &#8220;We finished our curriculum as the crisis began to pick up, and have since entered our dedicated period of study for the board exam,&#8221; said Ameen Chaudry, a second-year medical student.  However, the closure of proctored testing centers has led to uncertainty for second-year students. In response, UCLA faculty voted to extend the deadline to take the test for a full year, Braddock said.  After Step 1 board exams are completed, students enter their third year of medical school, centered around clinical rotations and direct patient care.  Second-year students are tentatively slated to start clinical clerkships in mid-May. Clinical rotations have transitioned online, while patient care has been suspended as no medical students are permitted in health care settings at this time.  Teaching faculty at the school of medicine have videotaped different surgeries, and made them available to small groups of students to gain unique clinical experience, Braddock said.  Faculty are also incorporating the study of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, into the third-year curriculum, lecturing online about the ways it is impacting patient care medicine, Renault said.  The current third-year class had nearly 10 months of clinical experience prior to the COVID-19 closure. These students will have the opportunity to engage in online learning activities in a variety of medical specialties, which will be carried over to course credit, Braddock said.  Third-year students are primarily concerned with how they will continue to learn about clinical practices and how future residency programs will assess them.  &#8220;Medical school is very regimented, with little flexibility,&#8221; said Elyse Conley, a third-year medical student. &#8220;With the nationwide closure of medical schools, I have a lot of uncertainty around what is going to happen for (my) fourth year and how that&#8217;s going to impact my choices for residency moving forward.&#8221;  Many fourth years have completed graduation requirements, and those who wish to graduate early will be able to do so, Braddock said.  Despite the ongoing pandemic, fourth-year medical students have matched into residency programs. UCLA held a  virtual match day  last month where students opened envelopes via Zoom, sharing where they would be spending their medical residencies. Medical residency programs allow students to become certified physicians in the specialty of their choosing, and usually range from three to seven years, depending upon the specialization.  Chris DeMatteo, a fourth-year medical student, said he had planned to finish his coursework early in the year and complete requirements by March.  DeMatteo, who has matched into Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City for his residency, said he is extremely excited to begin but remains nervous because of COVID-19&#8217;s impact on the city.  &#8220;Although I plan to get (to New York) in mid-June to start my residency on July 1, I am watchful as to any changes in that timeline,&#8221; DeMatteo said.

Going 7-17 through two seasons, sparking  a transfer exodus  and drawing criticism from alumni for  a seemingly weak stance  on racial injustice isnt the strongest resume. Kelly has often sparred with the media by  criticizing straightforward questions , giving  contradictory answers  and fostering  unstable relationships  with local beat reporters.  But, for the first time in what feels like forever, Kelly is finally saying the right stuff  all it took was a global pandemic.  Thirty UCLA football players drafted and signed a letter raising several concerns and demands about the team's return to voluntary workouts amid COVID-19 starting Monday. The Los Angeles Times published the letter in  an enterprise article  midday Friday, highlighting the players' desire for concrete scholarship security and a third-party health official to oversee the team.  The LA Times'  initial tweet  sharing the article tied the letter to Kelly and his players' mistrust in him.  It turns out that blame was misplaced.  Rising junior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson, one of the players who signed the letter, came out  in defense of Kelly  on Twitter on Friday. He said the letter had nothing to do with the team's trust in their coach and that Kelly agreed with all of the demands they made.  Kelly may have had a target on his back, but Thompson-Robinson is right  now is not the time to take shots at him.  In a teleconference with the media April 9, Kelly emphasized the importance of player safety and protection throughout the offseason and regular season, if there is one. He even went as far to say he doesn't believe it would be safe for players to take the field in the fall if it isn't safe for fans to be allowed in the stands.  Kelly has regularly stood on the side of science and caution throughout the pandemic, which is more than other coaches can say.  Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy  who has also recently come under fire for wearing a One America News Network T-shirt  made a push for a May 1 return of spring football back in April. Several University of Alabama football players tested positive for coronavirus when they returned to team workouts in early June and 23 Clemson University players tested positive for the virus Friday, but neither Nick Saban nor Dabo Swinney  the respective coaches  have made a statement on the matter.  The players who wrote and signed the letter were simply taking precautions and making sure their return to campus was fully insured and thought out. Their ability to take a stance, use their leverage and uphold their rights as players is honorable, and it is something more student-athletes should look into.  It is not a damnation of Kelly, but rather a show of mistrust in the system as a whole.  Student-athletes don't get paid a salary and they aren't part of a union. Meanwhile, athletic departments hold unmatched power when it comes to the players' academics, schedules and scholarships, and that power has been abused time and time again by coaches and administrators in different sports across the country.  Former UCLA football coach Jim Mora is being  sued by former players  for forcing them to play through serious injuries and shaming them for seeking adequate medical treatment and rest.  Kelly, on the other hand, has proven to be far more open and ready to listen. He and new director of athletics Martin Jarmond met with players over Zoom Friday, and Jarmond said concerns were addressed and communication will continue to be encouraged.  In a sport with a reputation of propping up and maintaining a ""tough guy"" mentality, Kelly's ability to mold his program on the fly and value his players' voices stands out in a positive way.  It would be shocking if the Bruins returning to campus don't get the whistleblower protections, third-party oversight and financial security the players demanded in the letter, not only because it seems logical and safe, but also because Kelly seems to be fighting this battle arm-in-arm with them.  Kelly has not been a winning coach since he stepped foot in Westwood. He hasn't even been a likable one most of the time.  But with so much uncertainty and stubbornness in the college football world, Kelly should be commended for his ability to adapt and maintain a productive dialogue with his players off the field.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['football', 'sports', 'sports-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.sp_.unconnon.MC_.jpg

The study, conducted by the UCLA Latino Policy &amp; Politics Initiative and the UCLA Center for Neighborhood Knowledge, found that many LA neighborhoods will not qualify for rebates offered by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.  President Donald Trump signed the CARES Act into law March 27, which distributes direct rebate funds to individuals and families based on their tax filing statuses and income levels. The CARES Act rebate provides a one-time deposit of $1,200 to tax-paying individuals who have an income up to $75,000 and provides an additional $500 per child.  Silvia Gonzalez, the assistant director of CNK and co-author of the study, said in an emailed statement that there are several hurdles for families to cross before receiving funds.  Households must file taxes to be eligible for the rebate, which excludes households living in deep poverty who dont regularly file taxes. The members in the household also must have a social security number to receive the rebate, excluding mixed-status households and those who are undocumented, she said.  Because of these restrictions, individuals living in deep poverty, immigrants, and Latinx communities are disproportionately left behind, Gonzalez added.  Researchers found that 56% of Latino neighborhoods in LA County are at high risk of not receiving stimulus checks and 47% of the countys immigrant population resides in such high-risk neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are concentrated in Downtown LA, including Skid Row, Chinatown, Koreatown, Pico-Union and Westlake/MacArthur Park.  The study concluded that, on average, low-income communities with high proportions of people of color were most at risk for not receiving funds.  These disparities will also impact LA County, according to the study.  Paul Ong, the director of CNK and the lead author of the study, said in an emailed statement that not receiving aid will compound the problems already present in low-income neighborhoods.  The communities that have a high concentration of non-eligible households are also poor neighborhoods with workers at high risk of suffering job loss because of COVID-19, he said. So they suffer double negative impacts -- loss of income and no relief.  This will emphasize existing inequities, said Bryanna Ruiz, a public policy fellow at LPPI, in an emailed statement.  LA County as a whole will be affected since almost half of its population is comprised of Latinos and a fifth is either undocumented or living with undocumented family members, she added.  Those most affected by this pandemic are the same workers that are essential to the economic success of LA County, Ruiz said in the statement.  College students are also at a disadvantage because many are ineligibile for CARES Act relief, including UCLA students, Ruiz said.  Westwood ranked No. 1 as the neighborhood most at risk for individuals not receiving a stimulus check because of the high proportion of students, according to the study.  Students are usually claimed as dependents on their parents taxes, disqualifying them from receiving a rebate since only taxpayers are eligible. Students with on-campus jobs or from mixed-status families may especially need the funds, Ruiz said.  Low-income individuals comprise a significant portion of the UCLA student population. As of May 2019, over 35% of UCLA undergraduates receive Pell Grants and 45% do not pay any tuition at all, according to a UCLA press release.  UCLA administration announced May 7 that they would provide a $200 universal impact award to all eligible students and additional need-based financial aid ranging from $200 to $1,850 to address this issue.  In addition, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced in April that undocumented immigrants will be able to apply for stimulus checks from a $125 million relief fund that will provide $500 to qualifying adults, with a $1,000 cap per household.  Gonzalez said in her email she thinks state and local governments should take further action to close the gap created by the CARES Act and protect these neighborhoods.  Direct economic funding to the most vulnerable regardless of tax filing and citizenship status is one administrative change that needs to happen, she said.  Citizens can help by contacting their local governments to express their concerns, Gonzalez added.  If we want just and equitable cities, then citizens need to be more involved and vocal when programs do not align with this core value and vision of what our cities should look like, she said.",['cap-alexis-duke'],"['los-angeles', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/5.15.news_.CARESpayments-01-966x1024.png

But some professors are pretending like nothing has changed.      UCLA announced it would be moving classes  online  March 10 and soon moved classes online only for the entirety of spring quarter. Despite the major change, standardized exams continue to play a heavy role in determining students' final   grades.     But moving forward,   this new form of teaching means a new form of testing is required.  In order to make the most out of an unfortunate situation, professors should replace final exams with research papers or creative online projects that will allow students to apply what they have learned in an engaging manner. This will not only keep students committed to the course throughout the entire quarter, no matter where that student is located, but it will also eliminate the risks of cheating all together, providing a more standardized evaluation of students' capabilities.  The problem with administering tests online is that students will rely on excessive note taking without fully taking the time to synthesize the new material. This has been an issue in the education system even before the outbreak of COVID-19: the reliance on  memorization  over analysis.  In addition, even if professors rely on the academic honor code or use popular software such as Respondus to prevent cheating on exams, students will almost certainly find a work around to this. And with students now scattered around the world self-isolating, coordinating a time to take the exams that would work with 10-plus time zones is nearly impossible.  With three weeks of notice, Sarah Beckmann, an assistant professor in the classics department, said she   changed the syllabus of her popular general education course, Classics 51B: ""Art and Archaeology of Ancient Rome,"" from a final exam to an open-ended research assignment where students can pick any digital medium they want on a topic they learned during the quarter.  &#8220;The research project allows students to do something creative with what they learned,&#8221; Beckmann said. &#8220;Ideally, other people in the class can access it and engage in that info in a fun, online platform.&#8221;   Beckmann said she   considered keeping an online exam, but found that an alternative project   gives students a chance to take charge of their own learning and reflect on the course instead of simply giving mechanical responses  .   There are a variety of  benefits  to replacing traditional exams with creative projects. Projects allow students to expand upon their skills such as problem solving, research gathering and information synthesizing.   And when students are worrying about the safety of themselves and their loved ones, regurgitating facts that can be found with two clicks on Google is the last thing on their mind.   Michael Wong, a second-year electrical engineering international student staying on campus, said he's had difficulty finding the motivation to be on top of his subjects and maintain a weekly schedule without classes, clubs and friends.  &#8220;I have been messing around with different forms of artistic expression such as music production, video editing and drawing,&#8221; Wong said. &#8220;If we were given the chance to do alternative projects (in all classes), such as the one in Classics 51B, I would have more motivation to do them and do them well.&#8221;   But creative final projects aren't just limited to humanities courses.  Kyle Cavanaugh, an assistant professor in the geography department, is currently teaching a physical science general education class, Geography 5: ""People and Earth's Ecosystems,"" and replaced a   traditional final exam with a final research paper.  ""A research paper goes  beyond memorization and develops higher level skills,"" Cavanaugh said. ""It prepares students for the kinds of products they'd produce in a job setting.""   With summer session A  officially  moved online and the strong possibility that C session or even   fall quarter will follow suit, professors must set a precedent of nontraditional testing early on.    It&#8217;s understandable why professors would want to change their syllabuses as little as possible; in times of chaos and uncertainty, some professors and students want stability in their class structures.  One could argue that replacing classic modes of examination is not feasible for all subjects. Cavanaugh noted that for some, like engineering and pre-med students, there needs to be a standard way to evaluate whether these students have a good understanding of the material. This is especially important because many of these courses are taught   in a sequence and require the knowledge of the previous course.  One solution would be to create a hybrid class that combines both traditional methods and alternative ones.   While a final exam can be a creative, cumulative project, the professor can administer smaller exams throughout the quarter to test specific topics of the class. Cavanaugh implemented weekly quizzes to test students' understanding of the material, while Beckmann is administering two take-home midterms.  Since final exams are still two months away, there is plenty of time to come up with a creative solution to the online exam issue.  Because without creativity, spring classes will surely turn into a mundane blur of waiting until the quarter ends.

Even so, COVID-19 is proving difficult to navigate for some of Los Angeles most established institutions. Some museums have exhibition archives they can dip into, featuring walk-throughs or installation footage. While some museums have taken the time to build upon this resource, others have simply plopped it on the web.  Keep reading for Daily Bruins take on how the citys popular art destinations are embracing the digital world.   Fowler Museum at UCLA   As UCLA began its rapid shutdown, the Fowler Museum at UCLA and its culture-centric curation were shuttered up alongside the rest of the campus. The Fowler has yet to adopt a digitally-first approach to its exhibitions, relying on archival footage hosted through  Vimeo  instead of developing interactive mediums for its current exhibitions. There are currently three exhibitions installed on-site, but only Rina Banerjees Make Me a Summary of The World has a walk-through video option.  Despite the magnetism and colorful eclecticism of Banerjees exhibit, the museums current stagnant slideshow format requires viewers to constantly fiddle with their keyboards to linger on the pieces intricacies. But a previous Fowler exhibit, Striking Iron: The Art of African Blacksmiths,"" offers viewers the user friendly experience they deserve. Currently stranded in Paris, the exhibition is showcased via a 3D exhibition model that remedies the drawback of recorded walk-throughs.  Similar to a virtual reality simulation, the interactive model encourages patrons to observe pieces at their own pace from limitless angles and viewpoints. This 3D model, along with 12 years worth of Fowler footage, is found on the museums Vimeo, offering patrons a look at exhibits missed by over a decade.   -Kennedy Hill    [Related:    Music Preview: Rising artists span genres and embrace lyrical depth in recent releases   ]        Los Angeles County Museum of Art   The   Los Angeles County Museum of Art has changed rapidly in the past month. COVID-19 forced its doors closed right before a $750-million demolition tore those same doors down for a  controversial remodel . But, its adjustment to the digital consumption of art has been just as quick. Reaching into its extensive archive, Sarin Cemcem, a public programs data specialist for the museum, said LACMA was able to compile past exhibitions and supplementary content for its visitors online.  A user-friendly redesign of its websites homepage organizes this content into categories of watch, learn and listen, among others, offering art that ranges mediums from film to articles. Although there is no replacement for the feeling of walking the halls of LACMA, Cemcem said her department strove to import the family-friendly, culturally-rich experience of a museum trip onto the computer screen.  LACMAs digital museum provides deeper insight into its extensive network and influence through behind-the-scenes tours, curated soundtracks and artist interviews. As COVID-19 boarded its windows, this city institution opened its vault of artistic gems, urging its patrons to continue exploring the world from the confines of their couches.   -Kennedy Hill    The Hammer Museum   Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hammer Museum already had a robust archive of artist talks, lectures and performances which can be found under the easy-to-use  Watch + Listen  tab on the museums website. Offerings include videos of notable authors like  Jamaica Kincaid ,  Tara Westover  and  Roxane Gay  reading excerpts from their books. This page also features Q&amp;A sessions on political issues with famous figures like actress  Jane Fonda  and filmmaker  Rayka Zehtabchi . Nancy Lee, the senior manager of public relations at the Hammer Museum, said in an emailed statement that patrons can watch or rewatch some of these pieces, noting that revisiting existing content can lead to new ideas and conversations.  In addition to the digital catalog, the Hammer Museum has made some adjustments to increase community engagement online. Mindful Awareness Meditation sessions normally offered at the museum every Thursday from 12:30 p.m. to 1 p.m. will now be held on Zoom. These free weekly meditation sessions are led by Diana Winston, director of mindfulness education at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behaviors Mindful Awareness Research Center. According to the Hammer Museums website, practicing mindfulness is scientifically proven to help decrease stress and emotional volatility, making this service even more pertinent in the wake of COVID-19.  The Hammer Museum has also expanded access to digital archives of select exhibits like Radical Women: Latin American Art, 19601985."" However, these exhibits are not user friendly. They are presented as a collection of images that require you to click on each one individually for details. Therefore, viewing an entire exhibit requires a great deal of clicking back and forth, creating a tedious user experience.   -Jenna Hajny    [Related:    The Online Edition: The Adjustment Show   ]      The Getty Center   Amid the fear and anxiety caused by the spread of the coronavirus, the Getty Center is helping people find entertaining ways to pass the time at home. In late March, the museum challenged people to recreate their favorite works of art on Twitter. Examples of popular posts include Vincent Van Gogh pieces made from pasta noodles and interpretations of Claude Monets ""Water Lilies"" in ones own backyard.  Aside from getting involved on social media, the Getty is offering video footage of current exhibits such as Michelangelo: Mind of the Master. The videos are accompanied by the commentary of curator Julian Brooks who provides viewers with a brief analysis of each piece in the exhibit. The videos are fairly short  only about a minute and a half. Their concise nature keeps the pace quick and viewers engaged.  Additional online resources include the Gettys virtual library where more than 350 books on topics such as art conservation, architecture and photography can be downloaded for free.

Diversity initiatives have done little to  increase  minority representation in faculty over the last decade. Administrators have made little to no mention of a  hostel  for students experiencing housing insecurity since the beginning of January. Zero-waste sustainability goals have  fallen   short  as a result of institutional obstacles.  The list goes on.  And unfortunately for students, physical safety may just be one more failed promise to add to that list.  According to the  2019 UCLA Annual Security &amp; Fire Safety Report , UCLA saw a 74% increase in reported cases of rape on or surrounding campus property between 2017 and 2018. Of the 54 cases in 2018, 29 occurred in on-campus student housing facilities. Under the  Clery Act , UCLA defines on-campus student housing facilities as residential dorms on the Hill and select apartments in Weyburn Terrace. These facilities are owned by the university, making it all the more worrisome that incidents of rape have risen. 2018 marked around a 140% increase in such reports since the previous year.  Unlike events that may occur in fraternity and sorority houses, there is no legal gray area  UCLA is clearly responsible for what happens to students on its property.  Although  most  students who were living on the Hill have moved off campus as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, sexual violence is an issue the university needs to act on now more than ever. On May 6, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced  changes  to Title IX guidelines that many fear will  discourage  survivors from seeking legal recourse.  In light of these alarming events, UCLA Housing and Residential Life must take a more active stance in promoting education about rape and prevention in on-campus housing facilities. This means directly connecting students with on-campus resources, mandating consent workshops for all residents and expanding sexual violence education programming. The university is responsible for its students safety  institutional negligence should not get in the way of providing residents the security they need. And in a time when the rights of survivors have never been more limited, these basic preventative initiatives are the least UCLA can provide.  But at the moment, the university appears content in its lackluster attempts to educate students about sexual violence.  UCLA first introduces students to Campus Assault Resources &amp; Education and the Title IX offices on the last day of summer orientation. However, these sessions are not designed for students to retain information about consent and sexual violence, said Ko Smaoui, a third-year physics student and CARE peer educator.  First, students are in a room with hundreds of other students. Smaoui said in order for consent workshops to be effective, they must be offered in small groups of around 20 to 30 people so participants can engage with the material.  Orientation is also a time when students may be preoccupied with navigating campus and registering for classes.  Youre bombarded with so much information about the university, Smaoui said. You know nothing about UCLA, (so) you're obviously not going to be in the best place to really take all of it in.  Incoming students are also required to take an online module for sexual violence and assault. While this course allows students to learn content at their own pace, it is a sorry substitute for what needs to be in-person workshops that give students the space to learn about a topic that requires undivided attention. The module is not only tedious for students to complete  it also saves vital information on campus resources for the very end.  There are currently no mandatory sexual violence education workshops for students who reside on the Hill or in university apartments, Smaoui said. While many resident assistants invite CARE office staff members to give workshops on consent, these events are often optional for residents. This means for the thousands of students who live in on-campus housing facilities, orientation may be the last time they hear about sexual assault from the university.  Regular exposure, however, is key to awareness, and awareness is crucial to utilizing resources. Third-year human biology and society and public affairs student Atreyi Mitra, who is currently researching barriers to accessing the CARE office, said there is a general lack of awareness about on-campus resources. For example, some students believe the  CARE office , which is now on the A level of Murphy Hall, is still in John Wooden Center West.  You cant use the resource and you cant receive further prevention education if you dont know about it, Mitra said.  University housing facilities offer the perfect opportunity to educate students about sexual violence. With communities aimed at acclimating students to the campus environment, UCLA Housing and Residential Life play crucial roles in informing residents about consent and raising awareness of campus resources.  Because for student survivors such as second-year public affairs and Spanish and community and culture student Delaney Ivey, the reporting process is difficult enough without having little to no awareness of available resources. Education and prevention measures are critical.  It comes down to putting survivors voices first, said Ivey, who is also the co-founder of the UC Coalition for Reproductive Justice, an organization that advocates for the provision of rape kits in on-campus health facilities. I think that a lot of empathy is generated when people actually hear from survivors.  It is true that the rise in reported incidents of rape may be a function of increased sexual violence awareness among students. Even if it is, the fact that these incidents still occur on campus is cause for alarm. And at the end of the day, the CARE office itself faces institutional obstacles to serving students. Between 2017 and 2018, there were only two CARE advocates for a total of 770 clients, Mitra said. While these systemic changes will require significant levels of funding, short-term solutions that increase preventative measures in on-campus housing facilities will come at little to no cost.  Students, after all, deserve no less from a university they are paying thousands of dollars each quarter to attend.  As for UCLA, their list of empty promises must stop here.",['cap-sabrina-huang'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.op_.carroll.sexualassaultuptick.DLB_.jpg

Although this competitive sleep-deprived college student is a common image, the culture that surrounds it is a dangerous and romanticized illusion.  Around 46% of students report not getting enough sleep five to seven days of the week, according to the  American College Health Association . In addition to this deprivation of sleep, students may mask it with acceptance and glorification. And whats generated in return? The toxic sleep culture.  To zoom out, the anti-sleep culture we see today didnt necessarily begin on college campuses. In fact, a poll done in 2018 found 65% of American adults believed sleep was instrumental to next-day productivity  yet only  10% prioritized it  among other categories such as fitness/nutrition and work.  This issue is further perpetuated when some of our nations biggest names such as the former CEO of PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi, Yahoo!s former CEO Marissa Mayer and even President Donald Trump publicly boast about their lack of sleep. Despite immense productivity being a result of their three-to-five hours of slumber, it dangerously implies that sleep is a futile and needless activity,  The Daily Beast writes .  Some people may have an anti-sleep mindset ingrained in them. And with a staggering  70% of college students  reporting an insufficient amount of sleep, the challenge is only exasperated during the university experience.  Around 2011-2012,  a Red Bull poster  preaching that Nobody ever wishes theyd slept more during college, found its way on several campuses, including  UCLA .  Not only do such advertisements foster negative rhetoric surrounding sleep, but they target a community that already is lacking in sufficient sleep.  Psychologist Roxanne Prichard from the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota has researched this subject since 1999. In an article for  Boston College Magazine , Prichard said the most consequential shift in our sleep schedules since the end of preschool naps is experienced during the first year of college.  The challenge Prichard describes has fortunately been recognized  not only by college students themselves  but also by companies seeking to uncover the sleeping patterns of students. In particular, the fitness group Jawbone  complied data  tracking 1.4 million nights of college students sleep and its figures conveyed a compelling correlation: the more highly ranked the school, the later the students bedtime.  UCLA students are no stranger to this reality. In 2016, Jawbone reported UCLA students are getting an average of 6.84 hours of sleep per night  or more simply put, not enough.  Third-year psychology and cognitive science student, Pranav Meda, can attest to these challenges, admitting his sleep schedule is inconsistent and he is often tired.  Similarly, Dana Wilks, a third-year economics student, said although she strives for a healthy amount of sleep, she knows many people dont.  Of course, heavy course loads and busy schedules are common to a majority of students, and despite attempting to strike a balance between various responsibilities, sleep may often not be a priority. But when did sleep become an afterthought?  In an attempt to better understand this trend, Abigail Williams from the HuffPost has  traveled across U.S. colleges , UCLA included, discussing college sleep culture with students. In  Yale Daily News , Williams said the mantra Ill sleep when Im dead was a common justification for poor sleeping habits, in addition to a general acceptance of sleep deprivation as essential to the college experience.  However, what was particularly revealing from Williams' visits was the cultural association between college life and lack of sleep: Students are staying up late even without academic or extracurricular stress.  Roni Touboul, a third-year biology student, described a similar association, explaining she tends to feel guilty when her roommates are doing work and she is getting ready for bed. In return, she will sometimes stay up later than needed.  Meda also said he feels weird going to sleep if his roommates are still up. He surpasses his tiredness and stays up late because he feels pressure to.  The root of this issue, according to UC Berkeley professor Matthew Walker, may partly be attributed to the stigmatization of sleep.  In an interview with  The Guardian , Walker said we advertise our minimal hours of sleep because we want to appear busy. Its a badge of honor, he explains.  According to Walker, people may be scolded and ridiculed for meeting the most basic shut-eye recommendations. Consequently, those who need eight or nine hours of sleep are embarrassed to publically admit it  they think theyre abnormal.  The stigmatization Walker describes surrounds us. So much so that it has even been translated to the common college language of memes.  Photos with labels  like haha i only got 4 hours of sleep last night, followed by i only got 1, as well as other jokes poking at sleep, regularly circulate college meme pages.  Although masked by satirical humor, conversations with a similar sentiment can be overheard in UCLA lecture halls, Powell Library bathroom stalls and even apartment parties.  Luckily, this issue has not gone completely unnoticed on campus. In 2013,  UCLAs Healthy Campus Initiative , or HCI, was launched  aimed to inspire a culture of health and wellness. Its efforts comprise a variety of  resources , including campus napping locations, educational events and sleep optimization advice.  Interns at the Undergraduate Students Association Council's office have also recognized the importance of mental rest, organizing a  Sleep Week  in 2015. One of their major initiatives during the week was a nap room in Powell Library, which could be a promising resource to reintroduce.  With finals looming around the corner, a need for a cultural shift in mindset is a particularly pressing matter. Our biggest accomplishment shouldnt be watching the sunrise in Powell Library. Perhaps it should be a lot more simple: getting enough sleep.",['cap-rachel-sarrafzadeh'],"['lifestyle-quad', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/ToxicSleepCulture.jpg

Treasuring anothers trash   When UCLA canceled in-person classes, Paul Kurek noticed that students moving out of North Westwood Village left behind still-useful furniture and clothes. Rather than let these items go to waste, he decided to repurpose them.  Its sad to see all of these things being thrown out when so many people need (these) things, said Kurek, a Germanic languages graduate student. I thought this is something (I) could do in a spatially very limited area.  Kurek collects clothes, shoes, toys and other discarded items while walking through his neighborhood. He then cleans them in his home, and places them in a donation box outside the graduate student housing in Weyburn Terrace, he said. He also incorporates other items like paintings and furniture into his own apartment.  I found a painting of a wave ... and a lot of frames that I use to reframe other things, Kurek said. It felt good to take things others have left behind and recycle them, and its recreational to clean (those items) and rearrange my apartment.  On one of his walks, Kurek came across a metal suitcase near his apartment. He brought it to his apartment and opened it with a screwdriver to discover a rare West German artifact a functional 1957 Olympia typewriter.  I was born around the time when the Berlin Wall fell, so its a piece of history thats connected to my own life, and I found it next to a blue bin in Westwood Village, Kurek said. It actually works, but I use it as a decorative piece.  Changing his apartments aesthetic helps improve his mental well-being as he spends more time confined to the area during the lockdown, Kurek added.  Its a good distraction that has a small impact and keeps up the spirits, Kurek said. It has an ecological impact on a very, very small scale, but thats what we can do at this time.

(MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  &nbsp;   Direct to order   With local restaurants struggling amid social restrictions, one Westwood resident is going out of his way to directly support them.  Garrett Higginbotham, a UCLA alumnus, said he wanted to support struggling local restaurants, such as The Lime Truck and Cava, to stave off closures like what befell  Stans Donuts.   (These restaurants) relied on (more than) 40,000 students to be in the community buying food and groceries, Higginbotham said. The volume isnt there as much, so Ive been committing myself to ordering take-out food two to three times a day and going to Westwood to pick it up just to help support a lot of local (establishments).  Higginbotham personally picks up his orders instead of using delivery services such as Grubhub and Postmates, which take cuts from the restaurants revenues, to ensure all of his purchases support the stores directly, he said.  Im making an effort to call these stores directly and placing my order that way, Higginbotham said. I think a lot of these bigger companies have the cash at the port for the time being, but it really is the mom-and-pop shops that cant handle it.  Higginbotham said he appreciated how the Westwood community and its businesses influenced his experiences at UCLA over the past four years and wanted to help preserve these businesses for future students.  Just being able to walk into Westwood and see all these thriving businesses is what made my college experience special and really important to me, Higginbotham said. So it only feels right to give back in a time of need to help make sure for Bruins in years and years to come to have the same experience I did.   Serving out soup   Stuck in Westwood, one student decided to volunteer at a soup kitchen in need.  Sheel Shah, a third-year human biology and society student, spoke with friends in the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine to brainstorm helpful steps he could take to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.  I decided, since Im already here (in Westwood) and Im pretty alone because my roommate moved out, Id contribute in any way I can to both the Westwood and LA communities, Shah said.  After hearing from a friend about the need for volunteers at the Hollywood Food Coalition, Shah decided to volunteer for six to seven hours on Saturdays with the HFC, he said. The HFC cooks meals daily and provides assistance for vulnerable community members.  In that time, I would make food, train volunteers who are new to the Hollywood Food Coalition, and also serve the food we make to residents who line up outside, Shah said.  Food donations from local retailers determine the specifics of meals prepared every day, but the general menu includes a salad, a hot meal that includes meat and vegetarian options, and a dessert, Shah said. Any leftover meals are kept in a refrigerator for distribution the next day to avoid wasting donations, he added.  While there are inherent risks with any social interaction, Shah said he believes the impact their work has on the lives of the residents outweighs those risks.  Its very visible that they would not eat that night if we werent able to cook the food for them, Shah said. Seeing the impact youre making on people who need these essential services is why Im willing to volunteer my time and take that risk.   Granting a new purpose   A local neighborhood council repurposed their canceled event funds to best serve those experiencing homelessness amid the pandemic.  Michael Skiles, North Westwood Neighborhood Council president and a UCLA alumnus, said the lockdown eliminated multiple events designed to aid community members experiencing homelessness. Rather than let those funds sit idle, Skiles redirected the funds to better serve vulnerable community members.  When youre experiencing homelessness, everyone else is able to shelter at home, but you cant do that when you dont have a home, Skiles said. Youre also not able to stock up on things like toilet paper, hand sanitizer and food.  The councils  Homelessness Committee purchased  one thousand dollar's worth of food, water and hygiene products from Ralphs for those living in Westwood Park. The NWWNC also allocated $1,000 to the Westwood Village Improvement Associations efforts to distribute hygiene and food kits to people experiencing homelessness in the Village, Skiles said. He added that the NWWNC donated $1,000 to the UCLA Community Programs Office Food Closet and another $1,000 to provide resources to help the homeless temporarily sheltered in the recreation center.  Skiles said he focused the councils funding on helping those experiencing homelessness because he felt that would be the best way to maximize the impact of the allocated money.  I felt that in partnering with these organizations, who were already on the ground and had a game plan, they could make this money go far and do a lot of good for people, Skiles said. Ten dollars with some of the organizations would provide food, water and hygiene care for a person that could make that person better off for days.",['cap-maanas-oruganti'],"['a-closer-look', 'los-angeles', 'news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ns_.wwhelpingout.MC_.picA-1.jpg

Last year, The Quad published  a story  detailing how the Daily Bruin selects its EIC every spring  we explained how things have typically gone in the past, with the paper's staff voting on and endorsing one applicant and the UCLA Communications Board appointing the endorsed applicant into the role.  Just a few days after the story was published, however, the Communications Board broke its streak of selecting the internally endorsed staff member and went with another applicant. Long story short, 44 Daily Bruin staffers  called for a strike  and shortly thereafter began working with the Communications Board to see how the paper could  reform the EIC selection  process so that it would have more transparency.  This year, staff at UC Davis student newspaper, The California Aggie, have found themselves  in a similar situation , questioning the productivity of the process they currently have in place. With EIC-related dissension at two sister schools in such a short span of time, its worthwhile to explore how other University of California student newspapers select their respective EICs  The Quad spoke with five EICs at UC student newspapers to see what selection processes work well and how the system can be improved.   [Related:    Press Pass: The grueling process behind Daily Bruins yearly contest for editor-in-chief ]     At The Aggie, unlike at other UC publications, the UC Davis Campus Media Board conducts all EIC selection procedures, said Kaelyn Tuermer-Lee, the papers current EIC, in an emailed statement. The board is supposed to consist of a nonvoting chair, ex-officio members and seven voting members, five of whom are supposed to be undergraduate students  this year, Tuermer-Lee said no student members have been present at board meetings since the fall.  According to the Media Board's guidelines, those who are interested in applying must submit an application consisting of a resume, written answers to various questions and supplemental materials such as writing samples by March 15. They can also submit up to three letters of recommendation directly to the Media Board.  There is no internal staff endorsement or election process at The Aggie  the Media Board is the only entity with the power to select an EIC.  After submitting their applications, the Media Board conducts interviews with the applicants and chooses an editor  this is where things have gotten hairy this year. Media Board guidelines state that at least four voting members of the board must be present in order to reach quorum. This year, during the interview process, only two members were available to conduct interviews  Tuermer-Lee said the board claimed this was because of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, there has not been a consistent student voting member presence throughout the school year.  The Aggies editorial board and this years applicants for the position published an editorial April 14, demanding the board refrain from moving forward with the interview process until, at the very least, the minimum number of voting members for quorum could attend.  We are writing to let you know that all four prospective applicants for The California Aggies 202021 editor-in-chief (EIC) are refusing an interview for the position, as any selection made by Media Board would be in violation of its own bylaws, the editorial read.  [caption id=""attachment_379977"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Courtesy of The California Aggie)[/caption]  In addition, the editorial also requested the board work with the papers staff to reform the process such that an EIC be selected internally, by the staff members of the paper, rather than board members who are not necessarily involved with the day-to-day affairs of the paper.  In her emailed statement, Tuermer-Lee said ideally, the Media Board would act more as an advisory body for the student paper, adding that The Aggies autonomy is especially important to maintaining a free press that is not directly tied to the school administration.  I just (want) to ... stress the point that students involved in and with direct knowledge of The Aggie are best equipped to choose its next student leader, Tuermer-Lee said.  The board was unable to meet quorum until Wednesday, when interviews with the applicants finally began after three new student members joined the board.  Organizations like the Media Board and the UCLA Communications Board have an interesting history within the UC system:  I  n July 1970 , the UC Regents announced they were by and large displeased with the state of the newspapers on its campuses.  ""The Regents deplore the frequent use of campus student newspapers as instruments of socio-political advocacy and for the dissemination of lewd and obscene articles and photographs,"" reads a UC Regents resolution that was approved at the July 1970 meeting.  The solution? The Regents mandated that each university's chancellor create a body governing any student newspapers that received funding or support from the University (it should be noted that UCLA was ahead of the curve in this regard  the Communications Board has been around in some form or another  since 1919 .)   [From the archives:    Journalism faces budget cuts ]     This resolution essentially gave student newspapers two options: follow the governance of the school, or run as an entity completely independent of the school.  Of course, other newspapers at UC schools have largely managed to forego the issues staffers at The Bruin and The Aggie have faced in recent years. Sarah Harris, the EIC for the 2020-2021 school year at UC Berkeleys The Daily Californian, said The Daily Californian is independent of any administrative branches at UC Berkeley.  Those interested in becoming EIC at The Daily Californian undergo a process somewhat similar to that of EIC applicants at the Daily Bruin, minus any oversight from the schools administrative bodies.  Those interested in applying draft up platforms focusing on how they plan to lead the paper; those platforms are then sent out to the papers staff before an election forum where staff can ask questions and learn more about an applicants ideas. Following the forum, staff members vote on a candidate via a Google form  even if an applicant runs unopposed, they still must receive a majority vote in order to become the papers EIC.  Its a completely internal process, Harris said. Nobody outside The Daily Cal has a say in whos chosen as EIC.  Ironically, The Daily Californian's independence came not long after the UC Regents' 1970 resolution to regulate student media was approved. In 1971, after the paper published an unexpectedly controversial editorial, The Daily Californians Publishers Board fired three editors who voted to run the editorial, according to a  2011 The Daily Californian article . In response, the Daily Californians staff opted to split off from the school and become an independent, student-run entity, even moving its office off-campus.  This autonomy seems to be a major factor in allowing student newspapers at other UCs to select an EIC without any major roadblocks along the way. Harper Lambert, the 2020-2021 EIC at UC Santa Barbaras student newspaper, the Daily Nexus, said she cant imagine a situation like the one at The Aggie occurring at a truly independent, student-run newspaper.  The emphasis (at the Nexus) is really on having every editor ... feel like you have a say in whos going to be representing you and be leading you for the next year, Lambert said. It makes a big difference in the morale of the staff, because I can imagine it would be extremely frustrating knowing that youre going to do what somebody says next year and you have no influence in determining that role.  At the Nexus, EIC applications come out toward the end of winter quarter, in March. Every year, the current EIC and their managing editor draft up questions for a written application, which Lambert said gives the process some degree of flexibility with regard to how its formatted, as questions can change from year to year. After a Q&amp;A session with the applicants, the papers editors vote to elect an applicant.  Likewise, two campus newspapers at UC San Diego  The Guardian and The Triton  are also independently run, with entirely internal processes for selecting their respective EICs. This independence is relatively new  in 2015, the A.S. Council at UCSD voted to cut funding for student media organizations and since then, The Guardian has been free from university oversight. The Triton was founded in 2015, shortly before the defunding, and is also entirely independent and student-run.  Daisy Scott, the outgoing EIC at The Guardian said in an emailed statement the EIC selection process begins in the spring quarter, when applicants submit a resume, cover letter and a written statement of their platforms regarding their goals for the paper. Then, an interview process begins, which all staff members are welcome to attend and ask questions during. Following this interview process  which is recorded or transcribed for those who can't attend  the entire staff takes a vote and an EIC is officially selected.   [ICYMI:    Assistant Enterprise Editor Melissa Morris appointed as 2020-2021 editor in chief ]     At The Triton, the EIC selection process begins around midway through winter quarter, when the paper releases its applications for EIC and managing editor to the staff. Around week eight, Ella Chen, the paper's current EIC, said the paper's editorial board conducts interviews with the candidates and then votes to select both positions  this differs slightly from other newspapers, which often allow for the incoming EIC to select the managing editor themselves. Like at the Nexus, contributing writers don't have a say in the voting process.  Beyond their autonomy, what the papers at UC Berkeley, UCSB and UCSD have in common is the fact that they havent had any major controversies regarding the EIC selection process in their recent histories. While entities like UC Davis Campus Media Board and the UCLA Communications Board can provide valuable advice  and in UCLAs case at least, help manage the paper's budget responsibly  giving an external body the power to select an EIC has the potential to underscore dissonance between the interests of the papers staff and the administration.",['cap-andrew-warner'],"['campus-quad', 'press-pass', 'student-life']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/5.7_eicselection.png

But dozens of UCLA student-athletes had their seasons cut short and thousands of fans were robbed of seeing the Bruins emerge on the biggest stages this spring.    However, UCLA Athletics still left its mark on this shortened year, and the Daily Bruin Sports editors battled over which singular moment stood out the most.    Football's comeback against Washington State  Sept. 21, 2019   Sam Connon, Sports editor   The Bruins were winless, on the road and facing a 32-point deficit with 18:48 left in the game.  ESPN's Win Probability chart gave UCLA football a 0.01% chance to escape with the win after then-No. 19 Washington State scored to go up 49-17 midway through the third quarter in Pullman.  What happened next was not only unpredictable, but it was also unheard of  this was no ordinary comeback.  UCLA had staged miraculous comebacks in the past  most recently against Texas A&amp;M in the 2017 season opener  but this time, proven clutch performers Josh Rosen, Caleb Wilson, Darren Andrews and Jordan Lasley were nowhere to be found.  This time around, UCLA put up 29-straight points to spark a 43-7 run, culminating in a 69-yard punt return touchdown by redshirt freshman receiver Kyle Philips. It was the second special teams score by the Bruins that night, as redshirt junior running back Demetric Felton brought a kickoff back 100 yards in the second quarter.  It took UCLA just shy of 13 minutes to flip a 32-point deficit into a four-point lead, but Washington State answered with a 65-yard bomb by quarterback Anthony Gordon that gave the Cougars the lead yet again.  Sophomore quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson and the Bruin offense got the ball back with 2:27 left to play, and they successfully capped off the comeback with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Felton over five minutes later.  A strip sack by redshirt senior linebacker Keisean Lucier-South, who was making his season debut, sealed the victory, and the Bruins won their first game of the 2019 season 67-63.  The game featured 1,077 passing yards, 18 touchdowns and seven turnovers between the two teams, making it one of the crazier games in recent memory. Thompson-Robinson set the UCLA record book ablaze with 564 total yards and seven total touchdowns, proving to his critics he could show up in big games.  Beyond the heightened drama and highlight plays in the moment, the comeback also marked the start of a 4-2 stretch that put the Bruins in position to win the Pac-12. That didn't edit up coming to fruition, but it is undoubtedly the most unforgettable night of the Chip Kelly era so far.   Womens soccers upset rivalry win  Nov. 8. 2019   Jacqueline Dzwonczyk, assistant Sports editor   [caption id=""attachment_377932"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Junior forward Ashley Sanchez kept it cool in her postgame interview following then-No. 14 UCLA womens soccers win over then-No. 9 USC at Wallis Annenberg Stadium in the teams final contest of the regular season.  ""I mean, what rivalry?"" Sanchez said.  The comment alluded to the fact that the Bruins 4-2 win was their fourth straight over the Trojans. But for most of the game, it was unclear whether that winning streak would hold.  USC took an early lead in the fifth minute with a goal from forward/midfielder Natalie Jacobs before UCLA redshirt senior forward Chloe Castaneda equalized 21 minutes in  contributing to her six goals across the final eight games of the season.  Freshman forward Mia Fishel soon gave the Bruins the lead when she scored her ninth goal of the year. Once again, though, the score was tied up after a goal late in the first half from Trojan forward Penelope Hocking, who finished the season as the Pac-12's second-leading scorer.  That was the end of the back-and-forth affair.  In the 75th minute, junior midfielder Viviana Villacorta made a tracking run to the back post, timing it to collect the rebound from junior defender Delanie Sheehans shot and redirect it into the back of the net.  Her teammates tackled her into a dog-pile, and the sold-out crowd at Wallis Annenberg Stadium  which was hosting its first crosstown rivalry matchup  erupted at the sight of what would be the game-winning goal.  Even with the lead late in the game, the Bruin offense didnt let up. Sheehan ripped another shot from distance that hit the crossbar, and this time it was Sanchez who followed up the rebound, heading the ball across the box for junior defender Lucy Parker to head into the back of the net.  The assist was Sanchezs 39th in less than three years in Westwood, which broke the program record for career assists.  With the win, UCLA secured a second-place conference finish and a No. 2 seed for the NCAA tournament.   Women's water polo's win over USC  Feb. 9, 2020   Jack Perez, assistant Sports editor   [caption id=""attachment_377933"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Alice Naland/Daily Bruin staff)[/caption]  Although the season would eventually be cut short, coach Adam Wright finally got a win over his biggest rival.     Following his appointment during the summer of 2017, Wright and UCLA women's water polo had fallen to USC in seven straight contests, including losses in two straight championship matches at the Triton Invitational.  The 2020 season had brought about challenges for both squads. The Trojans were still adapting to life under new coach Marko Pintaric, who took over for former coach Jovan Vavic when he was fired in March 2018.  UCLA had to deal with the loss of two of its top players to Olympic training and had already been upset by UC Santa Barbara earlier in the year. However, the Bruins came into the matchup riding a 12-game winning streak and averaged over 14 goals per game in their first three games of the 2020 Triton Invitational.  The teams started off the game with three goals combined within the first 64 seconds before going over nine minutes without another score. USC would eventually take a 3-2 lead with the first quarter-and-a-half gone.  After that, UCLA ran off a three-goal run over the next eight minutes, highlighted by two goals from freshman utility Abbi Hill scoring in her first-ever match versus USC. Hill would be one of six Bruins to net a goal in the game and the only one to score more than once.  The Bruins kept the Trojans at bay with a 2-1 scoring advantage in the final frame to down them 7-5, snapping USC's seven-year winning streak in La Jolla, California, and claiming UCLA's only tournament win of the year.  Between Hill's emergence as a go-to scorer and a rare win against a top-ranked crosstown rival, the Bruins showed off the potential that Wright and his staff could have molded into a title-winning team come May.   Gymnastics' history-making meet versus Utah  Feb. 23, 2020   Coral Smith, assistant Sports editor   [caption id=""attachment_377934"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Tanmay Shankar/Assistant Photo editor)[/caption]  Bruin gymnasts are known for making history in Pauley Pavilion, but they outdid themselves versus their conference rivals this season.  Then-No. 3 UCLA gymnastics might have lost its rivalry meet versus then-No. 3 Utah, but the Bruins gave fans a show in their season-high scoring performance.  Senior Grace Glenn had been inching closer to a perfect score on the balance beam all year long, and the beam specialist finally stuck the landing versus the Utes, scoring the first 10 out of the leadoff spot on the beam in NCAA history.  With just one rotation left, I thought that moment was going to be the main story of the afternoon. But junior Nia Dennis had something to say about that.  All season, I had been waiting to see which of UCLA's unique floor routines would become the next viral internet sensation. That gymnast would follow in the footsteps of former Bruins Katelyn Ohashi, Hallie Mossett and Sophina DeJesus, who were responsible for viral floor routines of their own each of the last four years.  Amid a top-ranked 49.800 team score on the rotation, Dennis took the floor for her Beyonc-inspired routine, tumbling and dancing her way through a performance that left the crowd screaming for the perfect 10.  While one judge did not think Dennis' routine reached perfection, the internet disagreed. The video went viral within a week, eventually accumulating over 30 million views online.  Being able to watch both of these momentous routines in person in one afternoon was the highlight of the entire year of sports for me, and judging by the response online, I'd say most UCLA fans would agree.   Jaime Jaquez Jr.'s game-winning 3-pointer  Feb. 27, 2020   Jared Tay, assistant Sports editor   [caption id=""attachment_377935"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Niveda Tennety/Assistant Photo editor)[/caption]  In the press box of Pauley Pavilion, UCLA Athletics posts a placard at each of the seats warning working press members that cheering is unacceptable.      Admittedly, I broke that rule once.  Those posted guidelines went out the window when freshman guard/forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. drained a 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds left to give UCLA men's basketball a 75-72 win over Arizona State in the Bruins' second-to-last game at Pauley Pavilion.  As I was simultaneously scrambling to write the game wrap while and filming the moment from my phone, I watched the shot go down and heard the hometown crowd erupt. And as I rewatch the video over and over again, I can see the video shake right as the shot went in, and hear myself fail to hold back a victory yell in the background.    Jaime Jaquez with the DEEP-3 for the win.  @UCLAMBB  takes the game 75-72  pic.twitter.com/nyoEHkcztS    Jared Tay (@JaredTayDB)  February 28, 2020       Jaquez's shot capped arguably one of the best games I have seen in Pauley Pavilion. I watched the Bruins storm back from an early deficit on the back of 19 first-half points from freshman guard/forward Jake Kyman  15 of those coming from deep.  I witnessed a late second-half push by the Sun Devils, and was forced to rewrite most of my prewritten game recap again. So when Jaquez swished that 3-pointer to give the Bruins their sixth-consecutive win  thrusting them to the top of the Pac-12 standings and pushing them even closer to an NCAA tournament berth  I couldn't help but scream.  Better yet, I had written a  feature story on Jaquez  as part of Daily Bruin Sports'  men's basketball insert  for the upcoming Arizona game that was being sent to the printer that night. The Jaquez feature would be on newsstands the morning after, so to say timing was perfect would be an understatement.  It seemed the stars were aligned that night, making for my favorite sports moment of the year  and perhaps in all my time with Daily Bruin.","['cap-sam-connon', 'cap-jacqueline-dzwonczyk', 'cap-jack-perez', 'cap-coral-smith', 'cap-jared-tay']","['football', 'gymnastics', 'mens-basketball', 'sports', 'sports-columns', 'womens-soccer', 'womens-water-polo']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/CC834F1C-3BA1-4EB8-B438-F02CF4A4D4B3.jpeg

The center has implemented Zoom tutorial programs, as well as a phone-buddy system for retirees called Telebruin.  Telebruin began in late March and has about 70 retirees signed up, Dixon said. The purpose is to combat social isolation in a time when many retirees are no longer able to meet together for their usual activities.  Telebruin is like an old school phone tree, Dixon said. I gave each other their contact information and said reach out, text them, call them, just be a friend. We wanted to create this kind of solution for people who are not tech-savvy to keep them engaged and try to find ways that we can expand our social supportive network.  Dixon added she thinks the social isolation experienced in quarantine will have a long term effect on the senior population.  I think the stay-at-home order has an unintended consequence on seniors and how they're dealing with their everyday life, Dixon said. It kind of created this bubble of a social recession. It's a collapse in normal social contact for this population. It's a huge, huge public concern.  Students with autoimmune disorders have also been hit hard by the pandemic. Jonathan Ma, a sixth-year art student, has an autoimmune disorder that affects his joints and other parts of his body.  Ma relies on immunosuppressants because he is at a higher risk of getting sick as compared to other people his age. While he has been immunocompromised for two years now, he has never needed to social distance or quarantine beyond avoiding direct contact with sick people during the flu season.  Ma has minimized exposure to running errands during quarantine. Besides the anxiety surrounding the situation, Ma said his quarantine is not any different from a person who isn't immunocompromised.  However, he added that concerns about the coronavirus have been taking a toll on his overall mental health. The social isolation aspect of quarantine has sometimes led to anxiety, depressive thoughts and cabin fever, Ma said.  Last week I experienced small flu-like symptoms, Ma said. The risk of the coronavirus sparked anxiety.  For some students, however, their concerns are regarding family members that are immunocompromised.  Jack Gibson, a second-year English and political science student, currently lives at home. His mother has Hashimoto's disease and Lyme disease. In order to avoid any risk of his mother contracting COVD-19, their family chose to stock up on canned food during the initial weeks of the outbreak and have been completely isolated since.  Gibson said because of his parents' health situation, he will likely be the one to run errands but added there will be stress in ensuring that he doesnt spread the coronavirus to his parents.  He added that the anxiety about his mother's health has made coping with school work difficult. Although he reached out to Counseling and Psychological Services and the Center for Accessible Education, their response times have been slow, he said. While Gibson said professors have been understanding, he added it is difficult to connect with them online.  Dixon recommends reaching out to immunocompromised friends and family during this time.  This is a great time for connection,"" Dixon said. ""If there's ways to reestablish those connections that maybe have gone on too long.""","['cap-abby-thomas', 'cap-anushka-chakrabarti']","['a-closer-look', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.news_.highrisk.JHan_.jpg

But after the World Health Organization  declared  the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic March 11, learning in and out of the classroom came to a screeching halt. UCLA students  moved  online, and by March 18, most of the campus was closed and in-person commencement ceremonies were canceled.  While conferences, access to gyms and every other facet of student life has changed, one thing hasn&#8217;t &#8211; tuition costs.  Despite the extremity of our current circumstances and the financial stress it has induced, University of California Regents  chose  to keep all campus fees in place. Now that the UC system has rejected any chance of students receiving reimbursements, it is time UCLA works with the UC system to apply the more than $488 of our tuition intended for spaces only accessible on campus back toward programs students can access virtually.  Instead of charging students for unusable recreation centers and on-campus events, UCLA needs to prioritize what students can make use of. Access to different forms of entertainment and personalized therapy is exactly what students should be receiving during these difficult times.   UCLA could expand access to entertainment platforms to students living off campus or at home for the quarter, create art supplies and food funds for struggling students and expand the number of therapists available on the Counseling and Psychological Services new telecommunications platform.  Because for students paying thousands of dollars for Zoom lectures this quarter, these services are the least the university could do.    Sachi Cooper, a second-year geography student and director of USAC&#8217;s Financial Supports Commission's UC Affordability Committee, made the decision to move home and declare nonattendance for spring quarter.  &#8220;I understand why (UCLA) can't reduce tuition, because they have increased costs, or at least their maintained costs,&#8221; Cooper said. &#8220;I think that in the future, what I expect from administration ... when it comes to finances or anything in general, is transparency.&#8221;  But as of now, a transparency report would leave few students impressed.  Undergraduates' spring quarter  BruinBill  shows a $38 S.P.A.R.C. fee for renovations on gyms, a $37 Ackerman/Kerckhoff Seismic fee for renovations on the buildings, a $4.80 Green Initiatives fee, an $11 charge for membership at John Wooden Center, a $22 fee for construction loans for ASUCLA facilities, and the largest charge of all &#8211; a $376 UC-wide charge for vague items including &#8220;services related to campus life and campus community.&#8221;  Many UCLA families likely account for some of the more than 16 million Americans who have  filed  for unemployment since COVID-19 hit the United States. The stress from this change in day-to-day life is only confounded by the financial burden of unshakeable university fees.  In an email sent Monday by UCLA health officials and advisors, students were encouraged to limit time on the computer and instead enjoy cooking, art projects or reading.  But UCLA&#8217;s attempt at encouragement lands as tone-deaf when not feasibly partnered with resources for accessing affordable or free books, food or art supplies.  During a time when food banks are seeing an  increase  in demand by an average of 40%,  according to a CNN article , some students are less worried about exploring viral coffee making and more concerned about how many meals they may have left in their pantry.  Food insecurity aside, students are faced with a lack of clarity from UCLA, making it difficult to find solutions.  Juan Santos, a third-year film and geography/environmental studies student, has praised his professors for finding ways to adjust to virtual learning but does not share the same sentiment for the administration.  &#8220;I'm part of (Pediatric Aids Coalition) and Dance Marathon had to be canceled and moved onto a virtual platform and, I mean, there wasn't much UCLA could have done,&#8221; Santos said. &#8220;But, in the same regard, it would have been much easier and more helpful if they had indicated to us, since we rent out Pauley Pavilion to do this event, ... what was happening with spring quarter because for such a long time, we were unclear about whether or not to host.&#8221;  Santos is one of many student leaders juggling multiple roles while coping with an uncertain future.  A  2015 National Student Financial Wellness Study  found nearly 60% of surveyed college students stress about whether they can afford school, a number that has most likely increased the past month. Stress is known to exacerbate anxiety, depression, and can lead to concentration issues and high blood pressure &#8211; none of which are  conducive  to academic success.  Adrian Yu, a third-year public affairs student, said he believes students who have been more fortunate during this time should be prioritizing their peers&#8217; needs.  &#8220;For the students from, you know, low socioeconomic status and historically marginalized communities, I think that this is a particularly dark period of time for them,"" Yu said, ""UCLA needs to worry about, I think, the students who this is affecting the most instead of just people who are going to be fine.&#8221;   Some students may suggest redirecting funds to nonessential services is a waste of students&#8217; valuable fees. But to downplay the impact creative outlets can have on mental health during this time would be a mistake on UCLA's part.   Circumstances are not ideal no matter what actions universities, places of work or the government take. It is therefore important that we find a way to brighten every students&#8217; day with the cards we have been dealt.  UCLA is correct in its mission statement &#8211; learning does not just happen in the classroom. It happens in our immediate community.  And though that community may be facing more challenges or be more dispersed than ever before, it is still here.

North Westwood Neighborhood Council President Michael Skiles authorized a $1,000 emergency fund March 12 using the Neighborhood Council Emergency Authority. The funds are being used to purchase and distribute short-term supplies such as food and water to those experiencing homelessness.  There have been at least 292 cases of the new coronavirus and two related deaths in Los Angeles County, according to the LA Department of Public Health. On Thursday, the county ordered all residents to stay at home unless necessary through at least April 19. California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a similar  statewide order  the same day.  Some NWWNC members made a trip to Ralphs on Tuesday to purchase emergency items. Gabriel Durkin-White, a UCLA law student engaged in direct outreach, relayed those supplies to those experiencing homelessness around Westwood.  Noreen Ahmed, a council member, said she is uncertain if the funds will be enough to sustain the  approximately 150  individuals who are homeless in Westwood for the next month.  I do not feel $1,000 is enough to support this population, but I think it is in our duty to use it before greater relief efforts begin organizing, Ahmed said. It is a matter of life and death for some individuals, especially considering the even greater challenge to access basic needs.  Some NWWNC members plan to request additional funds during the next board meeting on April 1, as any funds over $1,000 need board approval, said Councilmember Ernesto Arciniega.  Rhiana Caterisano, a member of the homeless advocacy organization Street Watch LA, said some of those experiencing homelessness are unaware of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, which makes them most vulnerable to the spread of the virus.  Some residents experiencing homelessness who use supermarket bathrooms have voiced concerns over potential closures that would leave them with no washing stations, said Durkin-White.  The LA City Council held an emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss efforts to mitigate social and economic damages that may be caused by the pandemic, and to prevent the virus from spreading on the streets.  The council passed an eviction moratorium intended to protect vulnerable residents from evictions and late fees for six months after the end of the crisis.  A provision of the controversial Section 56.11 of the LA Municipal Code that prohibits the assembly of tents during daytime hours will be temporarily suspended during emergency declaration, following additional city council action Tuesday.  The same motion, however, upheld another part of Section 56.11 that allows law enforcement to discard any personal goods that cannot fit in one 60-gallon container, a volume comparable to one large trash can.  Some opponents of Section 56.11 contend this temporary hold should become a permanent one. Caterisano said they think the code is inhumane regardless of the pandemic.  This is an extremely cruel law that has led to (residents experiencing homelessness) losing personal belongings such as medication and personal documents during sweeps, Caterisano said.  The city council also voted to install mobile bathrooms and wash stations near encampments during its meeting Tuesday.  Additionally, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Wednesday that thousands of temporary shelter beds will be added to 13 recreation centers as a part of a series of emergency responses the city has enacted to slow the spread of the virus.",['cap-hyeyoon-alyssa-choi'],"['los-angeles', 'los-angeles-city-council', 'news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.wwparkcamp.SG_.jpg

The Farmers&#8217; Market, the nonprofit that organizes the Westwood market, began implementing social distancing guidelines March 26. During the first few weeks of ""safer at home"" orders, only four out of the normal average of 32 vendors showed up at the market.  The market&#8217;s sales have taken a drastic hit and the market&#8217;s usual, lively atmosphere changed dramatically, said Aubrey Yarbrough, Farmer Mark's community development manager.   &#8220;With lines, face masks, signage reminding customers to social distance, and no-touch purchasing systems, markets that used to feel carefree now feel serious,&#8221; Yarbrough said in an emailed statement.  Marketgoers are no longer allowed to hand-pick produce, and stalls have been taped off in accordance with the 6 feet social distancing rule. Other market amenities, such as food sampling, prepared foods and live music have been suspended.  Vilma Gutierrez, who runs a stall for Gutierrez Family Farms, said she has struggled to compensate for the lack of business.  &#8220;I&#8217;m working ... a quarter more than what I used to,&#8221; Gutierrez  said. &#8220;Emotionally, I&#8217;m trying to keep it together. Physically, I&#8217;m drained.&#8221;  Gutierrez and other vendors have explored different avenues, such as delivery services, to sell their produce but these efforts have also required longer working hours.  Arnett Farms set up a roadside stand near its warehouse in Torrance and now sells pick-up fruit boxes on its website, said Oscar Diaz, an Arnett Farms vendor.   The Westwood Village Improvement Association is determined to waive Farmer Mark's weekly fees to relieve the financial pressure on vendors like Diaz and Gutierrez. Andrew Thomas, the WVIA executive director, said he will continue to monitor the market&#8217;s attendance and plans to re-evaluate its operations if customer traffic drops again.  [caption caption=""Organizers for the Westwood Farmers&#39; Market set up signs reminding customers to stay 6 feet apart while perusing the market. There are far fewer visitors since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Amy Dixon/Daily Bruin senior staff)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_380328"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   As a mid-week market, the Westwood Farmers&#8217; Market depends on sales to local workers, Thomas said. However, weekend markets, such as Santa Monica&#8217;s downtown farmers&#8217; markets, continue to attract large crowds, he added.  &#8220;There are already large and popular weekend markets very close to us,&#8221; Thomas said in an emailed statement. &#8220;It would be difficult to create an established market in Westwood over the weekends.&#8221;   All weekend farmers&#8217; markets in Santa Monica merged operations in mid-April, creating one large Saturday market where its downtown farmers&#8217; market operates. As of May 15, around 24 farmers&#8217; markets are open in Los Angeles County,   according to the LA Times.   Despite the initial lull, the Westwood market has seen a gradual increase in customers and vendors over the past weeks, Yarbrough said.  &#8220;Farmers' markets remain one of the few ways that Angelinos can support small businesses,&#8221; Yarbrough said.   Local supply chains have not experienced the shortages that continue to loom over supermarket chains, Yarbrough added.   Katie Melnick, a recent UCLA graduate, echoed Yarbrough&#8217;s remarks on the importance of supporting local farmers.  &#8220;(The stay-at-home order) has motivated me to go to the market for my fresh needs so I can avoid crowded grocery stores and support local farmers/businesses,&#8221; Melnick said.  Along with supporting local farmers, the market has given back to Westwood&#8217;s population of people experiencing homelessness.  Westwood Farmers&#8217; Market partnered with the Salvation Army&#8217;s Westwood Transitional Village, which offers housing for families transitioning out of homelessness, in March, to deliver fresh produce to its residents, Yarbrough said.   The market has been soliciting donations to purchase local produce for residents, many of whom have lost their jobs. Over the past month, the market has donated $400 worth of produce to the Transitional Village every week, Yarbrough said.   Amy Okada, a fourth-year anthropology student, has suspended her trips to the Westwood Farmers&#8217; Market in an attempt to adhere to social distancing guidelines.   &#8220;I usually just go to the actual market every week, but I wanted to decrease my ...(time) outside, where it can tend to get more populated,&#8221; Okada said. &#8220;Since quarantine, I have not attended the Westwood market.&#8221; ",['cap-arif-abd-aziz'],"['los-angeles', 'news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.A.news_.farmersmarket.ADX_.jpg

With a winter quarter final I knew nothing about due in 24 hours, I saw the world around me uproot. I had been down with the flu for more than a week, and things around the world changed faster than I could keep track. My fellow Overseas Citizen of India friends were getting ready to fly to India, while I staggered back to a crumbling sense of normalcy.  Being both an international student and an American citizen at UCLA has its perks, and I had spent my entire college life hearing about how lucky I was  but it surely seemed to not be in my favor when India decided to close its borders, not allowing non-Indian citizens to fly in. I was scared too, partly because I couldnt wrap my head around the gravity of the situation and partly because any semblance of normalcy, which I gathered from being surrounded by friends and family, lay in a faraway future that I could not envision.  In a haste, I tried applying for an emergency visa to go back to India before the borders closed for Indian citizens, too. Twenty-two straight hours after a series of phone calls with my parents, the Indian Consulate, other OCI students who got their visas and the airlines to figure out tickets, I had to accept that nothing aligned to make this work for me. With angst, frustration and stress, I let that idea go to face my reality. I still had eight things on my to-do list to complete, but zero will to do any of it.  Hoping and wishing for the ban to be lifted so I could fly back soon, I was excited to enjoy quarantine as much as I could. My friends from San Diego opened their homes to me and let me enjoy life again. Through goofy TikToks, ridiculous TV shows, gossip sessions and hilarious cooking tries, we made quarantine much better than I could have imagined. I started talking to old friends in my free time and singing again. All the little things I have always enjoyed doing and never got the time to now excited me to wake up every day.  My first move happened when I went to my roommates house in San Jose after two weeks, assuming that the ban would be lifted soon like the Indian government had announced and tried creating a new routine for myself. Although I missed my friends from San Diego, I forced myself to cherish the memories and get used to a new place. From making dalgona coffee to taking evening walks with deep conversations to watching movies on Netflix Party, we made every day tolerable. My happy state of mind, of course, was short-lived when I found out the ban was further extended, and I likely could not go back home until June. As hard as I tried, little curveballs and changes took its toll on me and it was getting increasingly harder to take life as it came.  Amid the chaos came my much-awaited 20th birthday. But my heavy heart grew a little lighter as I looked forward to celebrating it with my roommate. I constantly just told myself that there was a silver lining in everything. We had lots of cake, FaceTimed our friends, ordered in some South Indian food and watched my favorite TV show.  Every time I convinced myself that life was sunshine and rainbows, another curveball came blazing. I had to move again to Seattle, where my only family in the United States lives so that I could stay put in one place before I could go back home. Hit with judgmental comments from unknowing people who asked me why I kept traveling and bridled with the fear of getting the virus because of it, I gazed outside the window to see the beautiful city of Seattle as the flight landed.  [caption id=""attachment_380444"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    The view from the flight into Seattle in a photo taken by Shankar. (courtesy of Ananya Shankar)[/caption]  It has been a week in Seattle and readjusting three times in a quarter has been challenging, daunting and crazy all at the same time. I cant help but wonder if the hushed whispers are the members of the family talking about me and my poor eating and sleeping habits, or if its in my head. I catch myself faking a smile every time they look at me like a dutiful guest. I walk on eggshells and try my best to stay in a corner of the house and not be too loud or get in anyones way, but measuring my steps and words only keeps making the weight on my heart tussle.  This entire experience has had emotional effects, with hearing people who know and dont know what I am going through say things and even factual blackholes that make me feel like this is never-ending, and the light at the end of the tunnel takes its turn in switching on and off.  I still catch myself sometimes staring at a wall, wondering when things will really change and if the ban will actually be lifted by June, and chills run down my back, forcing me to snap out of speculations and back to reality. But it also taught me a new perspective  I could either look at my situation and feel like the pandemic has exhausted me mentally, physically and emotionally, as there have been multiple weak moments of loneliness and realizing I am stranded.  Or, I could also look at it as an adventure and an exciting series of changes to keep me on my toes during the lockdown.

But there may be silver linings to the circumstances,   said Esther Dreifuss-Kattan, art therapist and facilitator of the Healing Through Art workshop at the Simms/Mann-UCLA Center for Integrative Oncology. In isolation, she has made numerous collages from old medical texts and colorful cutouts of individuals. The figures that emerged on her canvas, she said, appeared humorous but at the same time, upset.  Perhaps this reflects the anxieties of society during a pandemic, she said, as creation is a way to settle down and see what is happening within the soul.

Facilitated by Dreifuss-Kattan since 2003, the Healing Through Art weekly oncology workshop has moved to Zoom meetings to comply with social distancing regulations. Dreifuss-Kattan said despite the distance restrictions of telehealth, the workshop  in which participants create their own art pieces  is still a supportive place of expression. Individuals need a place to share their story and form a community in these times of crisis, often with older patients providing advice to the newly diagnosed, Dreifuss-Kattan said.  [caption id=""attachment_385051"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""508""]  Esther Dreifuss-Kattan, art therapist and facilitator of the Healing Through Art workshop at the Simms/Mann-UCLA Center for Integrative Oncology, said when she went into isolation due to COVID-19 she began to create making collage work and colorful cutouts of individuals. The faces that emerged on her canvas appeared humorous, but at the same time, upset, she said. (Courtesy of Dr. Esther Dreifuss-Kattan)[/caption]  Feelings of satisfaction from creating art help manage the sometimes lonely experience of immunocompromised individuals in treatment, she said. Leading the Healing Through Art group means asking patients to explore their creativity with guidance from prompts, such as freedom in isolation. These prompts can encourage reflection on feelings of grief and frustration, emotions possibly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, she said.  At the same time as (patients are experiencing the challenges of cancer), there is a whole other trauma: They're all isolated and alone at home, Dreifuss-Kattan said. These are the most challenging issues.  One workshop asked the participants to create a diptych  an artwork with two parallel panels  about contrasting feelings of denial and acceptance in the midst of a pandemic, said Madeline Elia, a Simms/Mann staff clinician and workshop assistant. With COVID-19 putting elective surgeries, such as mastectomies, and other oncology treatments on hold, she said art is a way for patients to process their increased sense of anxiety.  Despite its core focus on psychological healing, Dreifuss-Kattan said the now-virtual group setting still allows for moments of levity. Humor comes from the improvisation of art-making at home, Elia said, as she herself had to awkwardly collage together one of her pieces with staples instead of glue. While adapting to change, Elia said, art therapy allows individuals to process emotions kinetically when words are too complicated.  Even if they can't explain it but they can put it down on paper, together, the patient and the therapist can look at (the art piece) and make some interpretations to help the person or patient develop the language for what they're experiencing, Elia said.

When COVID-19 started to affect daily life, Ho said she felt something indescribable she couldnt immediately put her finger on.  After a number of days I realized, this feels like grief to me  like grieving for a way of life that we had known that is no longer here, Ho said. There is so much that people might be grieving ... the loss of a loved one, loss of a job, loss of a lifestyle, a home. It's just a lot that people are holding right now.  UCLArts &amp; Healing is an organization that creates and promotes social-emotional arts curriculum with nonjudgmental language and reflection strategies that are based in sustainable public health practices. Ho said the experience of arts and media, such as dance, painting or music-making, can greatly strengthen ones mental health. In bridging the gap between health care and the individual, social-emotional arts allow for a sense of neutrality, as the field contains less stigma and financial concerns in comparison to talk therapy, she said.   ""After a number of days I realized, this feels like grief to me  like grieving for a way of life that we had known that is no longer here."" - Ping Ho    Since many of UCLArts &amp; Healings in-person events and training programs have been canceled in an attempt to halt the spread of COVID-19, Ho said they went virtual with their Healing Online for People Everywhere Zoom series. The free programs include poetry workshops, Zumba classes and guided meditation sessions.  Along with Erica Curtis, a UCLArts &amp; Healing core instructor, Ho guest-taught a virtual session in May based on their book, The Innovative Parent: Raising Connected, Happy, Successful Kids through Art. The goal of the session was to provide tools for parents with children living with stress or anxiety. When an individual is distressed, the brain has difficulty processing verbal information, and conversations can break down as it reverts to a self-protective mode, Curtis said. Additionally, children are often easily overwhelmed by abstract, complex emotions they cant explain, she said, and art helps navigate that process.  We're more primed to be receptive to nonverbals, meaning ... stimuli in the form of rhythm or music and movement, Curtis said. The arts come in as an alternative way to be able to access that child and help that child to access their own emotional experience.

But the move to the virtual world hasn't interrupted Ho's own artistic practices, as she continues to take dance classes three times a week. Continuing this activity in quarantine acts as her personal mind-body healing process, Ho said. One of UCLArts &amp; Healings partner organizations, Addressing Loneliness with Movement and Art, treats dance as a community-building act as well as a therapeutic act.  With fiscal help and curriculum training help from UCLArts &amp; Healing, Julia Grace founded ALMA to address an underserved and neglected group: elderly populations in nursing homes. The organization began as a monthly program called PlantPals, through which volunteers brought flowers to nursing homes to reconnect elders with nature, Grace said. Over time, however, the nonprofit evolved to include more art forms such as group dance, painting and singing.  Grace said she saw the benefits of dance therapy when she was taking care of her paternal grandparents after her fathers passing 10 years ago. To process her own grief, she turned to an explorative, ritualistic movement practice called JourneyDance, and she later brought the dance to her grandparents nursing home. Dance is a form of nonverbal expression, she said, which crosses language barriers caused by diseases like dementia, allowing seniors to tangibly embody the present.  Furthermore, when the organization began including youths recovering from addiction as volunteers, Grace said her team noticed a mutually positive impact. Interacting with seniors led to an increase in the kids self-esteem and a decrease in ageism and substance cravings, Grace said  all while the seniors could reveal a lighthearted facet of their personalities through dance.  Oftentimes, (dancing) is very silly ... and getting to see our elders in such a playful state is really refreshing because we're reminded that (joy) never dies, that never needs to leave, Grace said. The more we play, the younger at heart we feel, the healthier we are.  The physiological basis for this connection comes from mirror neurons firing in the brain, Grace said, and these neurons generate a sense of empathy through reflection and togetherness. While dance is a more explicit form of physical mirroring, art practices always provide this opportunity for connection, Ho said.  People need to feel seen and heard so thats what the arts do, Ho said. The fact that someone responds means that you've been validated, you've been heard. That's how we organically build empathy and relationships.  [caption id=""attachment_385054"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""768""]    (Daily Bruin/Nitya Tak)[/caption]   MOVEMENT: Control and Release   An important part of generating empathy and validation comes from providing a safe space for expression, said Jennifer Jiries, director of UCLAs Campus Assault Resources and Education program.  Healing workshops, trauma-informed yoga and a journaling program, called A Write to Heal, are provided to survivors of sexual violence through CAREs intake system. Because of COVID-19, CARE moved their yoga program online and hopes to roll out further art and meditation programs during the summer, Jiries said.  It is important to continue the trauma-informed yoga sessions virtually, she said, as they help survivors let go of tension held within the body. Zabie Yamasaki's trauma-informed curriculum informs the yoga sessions, Jiries said, which guide survivors in regulating their bodies and trying to release stress and tension.  Trauma deeply impacts the brain and ... cortisol is released into the body, which stores itself in ways that are not helpful, Jiries said. Oftentimes with survivors, they're disconnected from their bodies ... trauma-informed yoga is about slowing down ... your breathing, allowing your body time to heal.  Jiries said the programs provided by CARE are not technically therapy sessions but rather workshops that promote healing and empowerment. Its about the creation of a new narrative where the survivor is in control, she said, where individuals set their boundaries about how far they push their bodies, mentally or physically  like in yoga.   ""What we are providing folks is a ... safe and centered space (for survivors), where you get to set the tone of how you interact... but at the core, we're encouraging you to reconnect with yourself, which trauma does the opposite of."" -Jennifer Jiries    Accessing in-person services isnt always viable for survivors of sexual assault or intimate partner violence, Jiries said, as attending workshops can be a big move in the extrication process from harmful situations. Jiries said the CARE team is trying to see the positives of social distancing, as survivors are empowered to seek out online resources from home and take smaller steps toward healing through virtual connections.  What we are providing folks is a ... safe and centered space (for survivors), where you get to set the tone of how you interact... but at the core, we're encouraging you to reconnect with yourself, which trauma does the opposite of, Jiries said.   FOSTERING CONNECTION   Prior to COVID-19, the spread out locations of UCLA Health cancer patients in Southern California meant many couldnt make it to in-person Healing Through Art workshops, Elia said.  Now, anyone can join through Zoom.  In its most basic form, the arts are available to individuals stuck at home to experiment with privately, Dreifuss-Kattan said. Those experiencing stress can take out some paint brushes or turn on the music, and they should not feel the pressure of being an artist, she said. By closing ones eyes and doodling with a few colors, then turning the page and continuing on, she said the individual can lose their fear of perfection and focus on expression.

(Courtesy of UCLArts &amp; Healing)[/caption]  Grace said while she has not personally experienced tragedy because of COVID-19, some of her fellow colleagues working in nursing homes have been navigating the pandemic's impacts with seniors who are more vulnerable to the coronavirus. She has been developing a virtual outreach curriculum since in-person workshops have been suspended, she said. Seniors abilities to adapt to new technology are often underestimated, Grace said, and by connecting individuals to elders this way, youth can access the vast wisdom of an older generation.  For workshop leaders like Curtis, Zoom usage has increased the reach of UCLArts &amp; Healing to disseminate strategies that can help the younger demographics, she said. Sharing these strategies are necessary, Ho said, as the arts are capable of enhancing positive emotions rapidly and are uniquely powerful in forming social connections.  When you think about problems like trauma and loneliness, its all rooted into the absence of connection, Ho said. Its time to broaden public access to these tools by putting (healing arts techniques) online, and what COVID-19 did was make everything faster. As a team, we decided we wanted to do something to help support the resilience of our global community.",['cap-nina-young'],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/crafting-connections-header.png

Navi Sidhu, Undergraduate Students Association Elections Board chair, brought up the need for changes to the election requirements at an Undergraduate Students Association Council meeting Tuesday because of UCLA's decision to move classes and finals online until April 10. Although classes have begun to transition, the campus remains open, and Associated Students UCLA locations are still operational.  Signatures required for candidacy will drop from 100 to 60. However, the deadline to submit them and other required materials will remain the same. Students are still encouraged to get more than the minimum in case any are deemed invalid, according to a post from the elections board.  Prospective candidates can also submit the applications packets via email now, in order to meet the Friday deadline. However, candidates must still submit the physical packet in spring.  In order to make these changes, the council added a temporary emergency clause to the election code, stipulating that the elections board chair can make whatever decisions necessary &#8211; regardless of their adherence to the code &#8211; with the council&#8217;s permission in order to ensure the continuity of the election.

From health care workers running out of proper medical supplies to students faced with quarantine boredom and isolation,   the effects of COVID-19 are hitting everyone in ways we may not immediately think of.  Luckily, UCLA students and alumni are responding to this heightened need for support with their own leadership, time and effort. Here's the Quad's look at what Bruins are doing to help out and provide hope in these difficult times.  Firstly, to financially help fellow Bruins in need, UCLA's Student Wellness Commission initiated two programs: the Basic Needs Subsidy and Student Relief Grant. The programs are open to all undergraduate students.   Mihika Sridhar, a fourth-year m icrobiology, immunology and molecular genetics student, and the student wellness commissioner, said that as a programming commission, SWC largely relied on their physical location on campus to engage with students in person. This has become impossible in light of the global pandemic, she said.  ""We were thinking of what we could do in place of (our spring quarter events) that might be more effective given the current pandemic,"" Sridhar said. ""Because of how privileged we are to have this amount of money under purview, we decided that the right thing to do was to redistribute it to those in need  like   a student who doesn't    have a roof over their head or doesn't know how they're going to pay for their next meal.""   [Related:    Donations help Westwood businesses feed the frontline of health care workers ]   &nbsp;  The Basic Needs Subsidy is  available  on a first-come, first-served basis and provides students   with upwards of $100 for necessities such as hygiene products, toiletries and medication.  The SWC is also offering the Student Relief Grant fund, a $500 need-based  award  to students facing financial hardships that are created or worsened by COVID-19. Approximately 200 grants are available, Sridhar said.  ""This pandemic is highlighting the inequities that exist at UCLA, the United States and the world,"" Sridhar said. ""It's necessary now for people to realize their privileges and thus also realize how their time, money and efforts could be spent helping others.""  Many Bruin-led organizations have popped up to do just that  one of them being Los Angeles COVID Volunteers, comprised of UCLA undergraduate and graduate student volunteers.  Haroon Rasheed and Hannah Hye Rhyn Chung, MD candidates at the David Geffen School of Medicine and the organizations co-directors of communication, said that their mission is to serve LA health care workers in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a medical student early in training, there is little I can do to help on the front lines of this health pandemic, Chung said. But as students whose future will be in health care, my classmates and I felt called to relieve the burden on our health care system here in Los Angeles.  LA COVID Volunteers offers four main programs:  PPE Management and Construction ,  Healthcare Worker Services ,  Food Corps  and Community Partnerships. The organization works in collaboration with UCLA Engineering, the Anderson School of Business, local restaurants and volunteers to make this possible.  In the month since the organizations formation, LA COVID Volunteers has been focusing its service on UCLA Health organizations such as Ronald Reagan Medical Center, UCLA Mattel Childrens Hospital and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, but they are looking to donate to smaller clinics in the future.  For those interested in getting involved, the organization is actively looking for  volunteers  in any of the four programs. Volunteers who can support weekday morning child care requests are most needed, Rasheed said.  COVID Transport Relief, commonly shortened to CTR, is an organization with a similar mission. Started by UCLA undergraduates who met during the 2019 Stanford Summer Community College Premedical Program, their mission is to coordinate the pick-up and delivery of essential supplies for health care workers in the Bay Area.  Rather than health care facilities at large, we aim to directly assist hospital employees and first responders to help minimize the added hurdles these essential workers face in trying to maintain personal safety, said Tasneem Sadok, a third-year neuroscience student and CTR co-founder.  Volunteer drivers are largely composed of CTR admin and their family and friends. CTR provides all drivers with a homemade mask and pair of gloves, and enforces pick-up and drop-off protocols based on CDC recommendations.  In the future, (we hope) to partner with larger and better-equipped organizations to facilitate bulk donation of supplies to local hospitals and clinics, Sadok said.  There are many different sectors of CTR that Bruins can get involved in, if interested. Donating spare supplies, contributing to the organization's GoFundMe or simply spreading the news through social media are some ways to help.  And for everyone struggling with quarantine boredom, do not fret: Concerts at the Kitchen Table seek to create a sense of community through virtual musical performances by fellow Bruins.  Concerts at the Kitchen Table was founded by third-year molecular cell and developmental biology student Akshay Anand, who was inspired by his own love for music at home and in college.  To source performers, Anand turned to friends, specifically those who, like him, were planning on participating in Spring Sing. As they watch these performances, audience members are given the opportunity to donate to  World Central Kitchen , a nonprofit organization that is currently serving over 100,000 meals a day nationwide to those affected by COVID-19.  In order to create and strengthen the performer-audience relationship, Anand heavily relies on the power of social media, particularly Instagram. Here, he posts artist highlights that feature a picture of the performer, a short biography and the songs theyll be playing.  By doing this, it pushes people to be more invested in the performance because its not like, Oh, Im going on for 30 minutes today and I know no one whos playing except a few of my friends, Anand said. By putting them on Instagram, people know who these performers are and are more inclined to be into the performance. You feel proud of yourself for being part of this performance.  Concerts at the Kitchen Table, much like LA COVID Volunteers and COVID Transport Relief, is hoping to grow  they are currently hoping to add dance performances to the mix. Likewise, for those interested in getting involved, simply message the organization's  Instagram , Anand said.     Amid the uncertainty that the COVID-19 pandemic has left us with, its hard not to fall victim to the chaos. UCLA students and alumni are providing examples of how to turn this chaos into positivity, one medical-supply donation, hot meal and performance at a time.  &nbsp;",['cap-audrey-pham'],"['campus-quad', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/4.28.quad_.covid19charities_artboard-428x1024.png

The start of residency. Burnout. Medical school graduates are entering the workforce during an unprecedented pandemic, and their experiences will be vastly different from those before them.   &nbsp;   At 7 a.m. on March 20, Geffen Hall was slated to be packed with fourth-year medical students and their families, the air charged with anticipation. An hour later they would rip open envelopes validating their last four years of work and detailing the next chapter of their journey: where they would practice their medical residency. Shouts would resonate, hugs would ensue and order would quickly descend into excited frenzy.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   For three years, Chris DeMatteo had watched this scene unfold below him, packed shoulder to shoulder on balconies with fellow first-, second- and third-year medical students still awaiting their own Match Day. He distinctly recalls imagining what his would look like, picturing the view from the crowded courtyard as opposed to yards above.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Instead, DeMatteos Match Day consisted of clicking on an email alone in his studio apartment while stuck inside because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.   &nbsp;   Medical students had submitted their rank order lists of the residency programs they were interested in on Feb. 26, less than a month before COVID-19 erupted in the United States. Their decisions were made without an understanding of the new normal ushered in by the pandemic  uncertainties in travel or establishing connections at the start of residency.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   If we were all making this decision today, the match would probably look a lot different from how it looked (then), said DeMatteo, who is entering an emergency medicine residency program at Mount Sinai in New York City. I think people would have preferred to stay closer to their home, closer to their families.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  [caption id=""attachment_385765"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1047""]  Chris DeMatteo (MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  &nbsp;   With a slight longing in his voice, I wondered if a part of the David Geffen School of Medicine alumnus wishes hed made a different choice, his current program being across the country from his family in Moraga, California.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Even for those staying close to home, the virus has created distance where, geographically, there is none.   &nbsp;   School of Medicine alumna Jasmin Neal is entering a general surgery program at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. Neal is moving closer to home on the East Coast, but wont be able to see her parents, who are just a state away in New Jersey, because of risk of exposure to COVID-19.   &nbsp;   These fresh graduates experiences, both as interns and attending physicians, will be completely different from every class before them.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Training modules will most likely be virtual, said alumna Haley Vertelney, who is preparing to head to UC San Francisco. The experiences of residents in some specialty programs, such as obstetrics and gynecology, are being completely altered.   At the workplace of one of her closest friends, an OB-GYN resident in New York, Vertelney said the labor and delivery floor has been completely transitioned into a COVID-19 ICU. Instead of caring for new mothers, now she is only seeing COVID-19 patients.   &nbsp;   Emergency medicine is changing, too. Although residents will still work chiefly in the emergency room, DeMatteo foresees a drop in treating the textbook heart attacks and strokes, and a marked increase in upper respiratory pathologies.   &nbsp;He hypothesized that he and his peers will become intimately familiar with ventilator settings and be the first to note any new hallmark symptoms of the virus.   &nbsp;   DeMatteo was originally drawn to the diversity of the cases he would treat in the specialty and the adrenaline rush that accompanies the detective work of diagnosing an unknown illness. The pandemic will put a hold on this breadth and excitement, but DeMatteo emphasized that the spirit of emergency medicine is being able to face anything that comes through the door.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   But the recent graduates will be stepping foot into their new hospitals at a time when the medical landscape is entering uncharted territory. Amid the pandemic, advice that generations of residents before could provide may no longer be as applicable to this years interns.   &nbsp;   As the burden on health care workers increases, the threat of burnout  emotional exhaustion and depersonalization because of long-term stress  is more prominent than ever. Every new MD I spoke with voiced it as a pressing concern, with DeMatteo dubbing it the other pandemic.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   According to the Medscape National Physician Burnout, Depression &amp; Suicide Report from 2019, 44% of practicing physicians report feeling burned out, with 34% attributing this feeling to lengthy work hours. Thirty-one percent of those surveyed managed their burnout through a decrease in work hours; however, with the demands of the pandemic, this may become impossible.    ""But the recent graduates will be stepping foot into their new hospitals at a time when the medical landscape is entering uncharted territory. Amid the pandemic, advice that generations of residents before could provide may no longer be as applicable to this years interns.""  The COVID-19 pandemic will bring the growing issue of burnout to a breaking point  since the onset of COVID-19, signs of PTSD and the rates of depression and suicide among physicians are twice the national average, DeMatteo said, based on in-depth research he conducted toward the end of medical school.    The push of new physicians into the workforce alongside the increased health care burden will call for sensible work hour limits, increased access to mental health resources and hospital culture focused on support and compassion more than before.   &nbsp;   In much the same way that this pandemic has disrupted the shape of American society, I think the burnout pandemic is going to disrupt the shape of the health care industry. DeMatteo said.   &nbsp;  [caption id=""attachment_385766"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1300""]  Jasmin Neal (MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  &nbsp;   While quarantined at her mothers home in Palo Alto, California, Vertelney said she pondered the toll that burnout places on ones mental health and additional anxiety that may be brought about by the pandemic. This weight has already given her fear fatigue, and she admits that shes reached the point where shes expecting to contract the coronavirus  .  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Stacked on top of these worries are concerns that the government hasnt consistently prioritized health care workers, Vertelney said. Although practicing medicine is one of her lifelong goals, her excitement has been stunted by a shortage of basic health care equipment and personal protective equipment. In the shadow of this burden lies the likelihood of a second COVID-19 wave.    ""In much the same way that this pandemic has disrupted the shape of American society, I think the burnout pandemic is going to disrupt the shape of the health care industry.""- Chris DeMatteo  I guess Im just trying to have low expectations, said School of Medicine alumnus David DiTullio. At first we thought, Oh wow, if it's two months, thats such a long time, but its been two months. ... It starts to get overwhelming at just the thought of a second wave.   &nbsp;   Not only will the pandemic place a strain   on these newly minted physicians within the hospital walls, but it also threatens their work-life balance. The few hours they have off, previously reserved for evenings out or morning hikes, are now more likely to be spent in solitude, they said.   &nbsp;   You go to work forever, and then Im going to go to my one-bedroom apartment and be alone until I go to work again, Vertelney said.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Even when bars and hiking trails begin to reopen, there is a certain level of commitment to society which will prevent health care workers from taking part, DeMatteo said. With the recent reopening of businesses, many people may be taking reentry for granted, hoping to celebrate warmer days at coffee shops or catch summer releases at local theaters.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   But for many health care workers, this isn't the case.&nbsp;   &nbsp;     &nbsp;   For those in hospitals, even something as simple as helping a neighbor move into their apartment comes with complications in the era of COVID-19, DeMatteo said.   &nbsp;   It makes me nervous to do things like go grocery shopping or go to Ikea and pick up furniture, he added. My risk of infection is high, and I could be a carrier, and I have a duty to not infect those around me.   &nbsp;   For Vertelney, trouble arose as she was preparing her move to San Francisco during the height of the stay-at-home order.   She was still able to rent a U-Haul truck, but had to work around inconvenient hours and plan ahead to disinfect the vehicle. This involved bleaching the whole truck and letting it air out until any and all germs were eradicated. Instead of hiring movers, she had to enlist her mom, who is 61, to help lift all of the furniture into the truck.    ""For those in hospitals, even something as simple as helping a neighbor move into their apartment comes with complications in the era of COVID-19, DeMatteo said.""  Even when their moves are complete, the lives these health care workers previously imagined in late February will be far from reality  likely for months.   &nbsp;   I dont think New York is really planning on becoming like it was anytime soon, said DiTullio, who ranked the city in part for its vibrant culture.   &nbsp;   Residency may now be characterized by wandering down vacant streets that were once famous for bustling, and finding cafes that were old local gems with their doors permanently shut, he said.   &nbsp;   Before jumping in the waters of residency, Neal has been using her time to reflect on why she became a doctor in the first place, she said. She recalled the classic line of wanting to help others, noting that there has never been a more vital time to do so, at least in her lifetime. COVID-19 has created an unprecedented need for compassionate and committed health care workers, which has rekindled her desire to become one, she said.   &nbsp;   It's a strange mix of emotions that we're all feeling right now, and I think there's this deep-seated anxiety about the health and safety of ourselves and family members, and society as a whole, DeMatteo explained, building on Neals sentiment. But theres also this incredible opportunity to join the workforce at a time when weve never been more needed and have so much to learn. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;",['cap-zfinn'],['prime'],https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.featured-image.MC_.jpg

World War I left us with words like "" trench coat"" and ""no man's land,""  while the rise of internet speak brought on the ""meme"" and  Twitter linguists . Likewise, the coronavirus pandemic has adjusted the way we speak.  Language is in constant flux: It must adjust to encompass, explain and articulate unprecedented events, which is why in the world of the ""novel coronavirus"" we practice social distancing in order to flatten the curve. Even though these terms have become ubiquitous parts of our everyday life, a couple of months ago they were as foreign as their real-life consequences.  Public officials, medical providers, news outlets and even our idle aunts on Facebook are all using these new or repurposed terms to communicate during these confusing times. The Quad has collected some of the most abundant terms to help any head-scratching Bruins.   One Virus, Many Many Names    There are many ways we have decided to refer to the same virus. To begin, the official scientific name of the virus causing the pandemic is  SARS-CoV-2.  This denomination itself is an acronym, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.   COVID-19  is the name given to the disease caused by  SARS-CoV-2 . Also an acronym, COVID-19 is short for Coronavirus Disease 2019.  The term  coronavirus  is not new or specific to the current pandemic. It refers to a family of viruses that cause many different kinds of diseases including the common cold. Not to be confused with the beer, the viruses get their name because of their appearance under a microscope, which shows the virus   surrounding by spikes similar to a crown, or a ""corona"" in Latin.  Ironically, the term  novel coronavirus  is actually out-of-date. It was the initial name given to the virus before scientists discovered the specific strand causing the disease, which as you already know is  SARS-CoV-2.    Pandemic, Epidemic, Outbreak   Many of these new ways of speaking we owe to   epidemiology  , which is the scientific branch focusing on the distribution, causes and risk factors of health-related events in specific populations.  Epidemiologists study the different levels and classifications of a disease. COVID-19 was first understood as an  epidemic  by the World Health Organization (WHO) when it began surfacing in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. This term is reserved for an increase of an unexpected disease that affects a specific region.  Outbreak  is often used interchangeably with epidemic; however, it is reserved for diseases affecting a smaller region.  A  pandemic  is the spread of an unexpected disease worldwide. On March 11, the WHO officially classified COVID-19 as a pandemic after its spread reached 100 countries. The last pandemic was declared in 2009 because of the emergence of a new strand of influenza A, H1N1.   Call it what you want, but stay home   In labeling COVID-19 a pandemic, public health officials had to devise strategies for  containment.  This refers to the actions taken to keep an infectious disease from spreading from a small group to the larger community. Containment strategies have been carried out including travel bans,  contact tracing ,   and mandated  self-isolation and self-quarantine.  Contact tracing refers to the way officials identify infected individuals and trace everyone they came into contact with, asking these individuals to self-quarantine, or stay at home for a designated period.  Most self-isolation measures  for COVID-19  last about   two weeks. According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , this is the  incubation period , or the time it takes for symptoms to appear after a person has been infected.  Once the virus has spread considerably, the public health strategy turns toward  mitigation.  This is when public health officials turn to the population to stop the spread of the disease. Perhaps the most abundant and innovative term to originate from the current pandemic is  s  ocial distancing     a mitigation measure used   to increase the space between people to slow the spread of the virus. In current official terms,   this means standing at least 6 feet from one another.    Individual states have also brought forth their specific   methods of mitigation. These are often referred to as  stay-at-home  or  shelter-in-place orders . These measures order residents to stay home except for essential activities such as buying food, medical supplies, etc. There are generally very few differences between these orders; it's just semantics at play. The distinction began when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo  refused to call the order he was enforcing a ""shelter-in-place"" order  because he believed the term inspired panic.  These strateg  ies change the world we live in, including canceling schools, closing businesses, mass events, etc. However, if successful they will help  flatten the curve .  The curve we have heard so much about refers to the function of daily cases and the days since the first case.  The usual graph  shows two curves: a higher curve, which shows the spread of the disease over time without any mitigation strategies, and a flatter curve displaying the disease's course with mitigation strategies. The idea behind flattening the curve is not to extinguish the disease but instead to   reduce the number of individuals affected by the disease in a period of time, preventing the overflow of patients overwhelming health care systems.  Flattening the curve will ultimately help protect the front-line health care workers, who provide direct health care services to communities. These nurses, doctors, community health workers, pharmacists and more are usually the first point of contact between an individual and the system. Presently, there has been a lot of  criticism  that front-line workers in the U.S. are not receiving adequate personal protective equipment, or PPE,   which includes masks, gloves, goggles, and gowns to properly protect their own health. Among this equipment,  N95 masks  have also been lacking. These are  disposable respirators , which cover both the nose and the mouth and keep airborne particles away from the user.   Getting Through This Together    The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new reality for people around the world, including but definitely not limited to the creation of new popular culture terms. Some of them attempt to make light of an overwhelming situation, while others surface from changes in work or education. All of them, however, serve as a reminder that people continue to live their lives.  Remote learning and working measures have seen a rise in the use of video conference software such as Zoom. With this, there has been a rise in related slang.   Zoombombing   episodes of individuals disturbing a class or gathering on Zoom have popularized the phrase. Similarly, as gyms close down, the term  Zoom Yoga  has emerged   The Verge  even called Zoom ""2020's hottest yoga studio.""  More time at home has also resulted in new challenges, hobbies and pastimes.  TikTok , an app used mainly by teens, seems to be  expanding its reaches  to a wider age range to provide homebound people with immediate entertainment. Many of us have had to painfully watch our distant family members attempt the flip-the-switch challenge, or dance to the  ""  quarantunes""  of Doja Cat.  It does not seem as though the creation of new terms and ideas will cease anytime soon, as life in a pandemic engenders innovations and transformations.  It turns out that even at 6 feet apart, we find new ways to   communicate.",['cap-veronica-fernandez-de-soto'],"['student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/4.20.quad_.coronavirusglossary_1-01.png

Ngo, a fourth-year biology student, balances her academic work alongside cleaning, cooking and generally sharing the caretaking role with her parents.  There are UCLA students that have a much harder living situation, so I don't want to complain, Ngo said. It's hard for everyone.  The UCLA student body has been adapting to remote learning since the end of last quarter.  Last month,  professors experienced  an unfamiliar struggle of learning how to structure their newly assigned online classes. Meanwhile, students have been exploring ways to manage their coursework among technical issues, family distractions and environmental changes.  But with midterms in progress and finals looming overhead, professors and students alike are now truly putting virtual learning to the test. Online instruction has come with its own set of challenges, including time zone differences between students and professors.  Robert Maniquis, an associate professor in the English department teaching a seminar this quarter, is facing this unique challenge in having to teach from Paris.  My only problem is that in order to teach my courses, I have to teach them from one, two, three in the morning, Maniquis said. So I just have to figure out ways to get enough sleep.  While maintaining a regular schedule during quarantine may help emulate a life similar to one we had on campus, the task is not always an easy job.  First-year neuroscience student Candice Shihady said she struggles with managing her daily habits. Shihady added that creating and sticking to a routine during quarantine has become increasingly tough for her.  The first-year   said this struggle has also translated into productivity issues.  My sleep schedule is also really messed up right now, because it just feels like Im on break, Shihady said.  Many students have experienced lifestyle changes because of shelter-in-place orders, and technical difficulties related to remote learning have not made the transition easier.  I need to leave an hour of homework time dedicated to technical difficulties, said Danielle Goldwirth, a first-year applied mathematics student.  Goldwirth also said that she spends a lot of time tediously scanning and uploading her homework assignments. For example, the logistical challenges she has faced at home have also found their way into class.  My math professor has a whiteboard, so a lot of times there is a reflection or the angle is bad and the screen gets blurry, Goldwirth said. Sometimes she is writing so fast, and switching from board to board, its hard to keep track.  Second-year computer science student Zachary Finkelstein said that the newfound difficulties of online school are more than technical. He said missed social opportunities with his peers and professors have hindered the learning experience.  Online school has been very different from in-person classes, Finkelstein said. Missing out on the interaction with the professors and other students makes learning harder because were not able to ask questions in the same sense or talk to our peers as easily.  Similarly, graduate students are learning to adjust their coursework because of the unfamiliar remote learning environment.  Shannon Burns, a psychology doctorate student, is due to present her research to a dissertation committee over Zoom. Under normal circumstances, PhD students similar to Burns are expected to present their work to a committee of four to five professors of the field in person.  They tell you how good you did, and then you get to have champagne, Burns said. Now having to change gears on that ... You're going to give this presentation, but it's just going to be online  you're just going to be doing it as a Zoom meeting in your apartment. And then when it's done, you just turn the computer off, and you're alone again.  Burns is not the only one to express these sentiments  many students have also found themselves exploring ways to adapt to the new virtual environment.  A consequence of online classes is that youre at home, Goldwirth said. Being at home you might get a little distracted from conversation with parents, the TV being on, being able to do other things while in class.  Finding much-needed harmony between academics and leisure can be integral to the new, unfamiliar learning process. In an effort to keep up with campus life, Goldwirth has found herself jumping onto Zoom meetings and calls with her friends quite often.  A lot of these meetings can get in the way of classes, but its a good way to keep up the social interactions and activities, Goldwirth said.  For Finkelstein, just being around his family is an incentive to spend time with them over schoolwork.  I have a harder time actually sitting to do work, especially when the rest of my family is hanging out. Its hard to say no, Finkelstein said.  Goldwirth said that students arent forced to sit in chairs and watch the board at home, taking away the accountability of the classroom environment.  The freedom of being in your room means youre less focused, Goldwirth said.  The lack of routine, the difficulty of maintaining a high-pressure academic life at home, and the loss of valued social interaction  its a combination that can make productivity a struggle for many students.  But according to Burns, who asked some of her own professors for advice on how to function under quarantine, taking a passive approach to quarantine-related stressors may not be the most effective solution for students.  (Unlike) when we could passively have good friendships and normal life, you kind of need to think harder now about what (it was) about those friendships that made us feel really great and how can we try to replicate that as much as possible, Burns said. It helps make that relationship feel closer and provide more support in a really lonely time.","['cap-kimia-azad', 'cap-susan-monaghan']","['academics-news', 'campus-quad', 'news', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/OnlineInstructionOpinions.jpg

Human trafficking is an ongoing crisis that is not limited to the developing areas, brothel settings, which the media may often depict. In fact, college students can also be at risk of being trafficked &#8211; factors like exposure to large social gatherings, unprotected social media accounts and thinning wallets can make students a favorable target to traffickers, according to The National Center for Campus Public Safety.       What is human trafficking?    To begin,   human trafficking is the practice of controlling and exploiting human beings for profit, making it one of the most lucrative forms of modern-day slavery  , according to an article by  The Guardian . This $150 billion criminal industry is profiting in areas closer than you think &#8211; for example, Los Angeles County, which is one of the United States&#8217;  epicenters  for sexual exploitation and child trafficking.  According to the  International Labour Organization ,   approximately 40.3 million people were trafficked globally in 2016. People can be trafficked for a range of illegal commercial industries, including organ removal, prostitution, marriage and labor.   Marit Frost, a third-year geography student and vice president of UCLA's LA Stop the Traffik, said human trafficking is currently one of the most profitable illegal businesses.   &#8220;It is the fastest-growing illegal commercial industry in the world and it&#8217;s about to surpass drugs for how lucrative it is. ... Selling people is worth more and less risk to traffickers than drugs or guns,&#8221; Frost said.  Mary David, the director of communications of Journey Out, an LA-based nonprofit that provides services to sex-trafficking survivors, also   said certain demographics such as women of color, boys and transgender youth tend to be unacknowledged despite making up a large portion of trafficked individuals.      &#8220;If you are talking about an American victim, you might see a blonde woman,"" David said. ""And while, yes, they are certainly also victims ... our most marginalized communities ... are so overlooked.""   Current policy and advocacy    Past and present policy pertaining to human trafficking provides insight into the ways this global crisis is handled at a federal level.   Human trafficking was made a federal crime in 2000 with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act under Bill Clinton. Since then, initiatives   to combat human trafficking have developed, including revisions to the TVPA and dispersed responsibility   among the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Judicial Department and social service agencies. Doing so allows federal agency workers to tackle specific tasks, making it easier to combat the overwhelming issues of trafficking.  Oftentimes, individuals trafficked into the U.S. struggle to escape their traffickers because they do not have a legal job or an independent income. A   visa created to reduce this issue is the  T Visa , which allows people who have been trafficked and their immediate family members to stay in the U.S. and work temporarily.  However, President Donald Trump's recent reversals on immigration policies impose stricter requirements to qualify for this visa, according to Frost. These qualifications include requiring proof of being a victim of human trafficking, such as court documents, witness statements or medical reports. Imposing these regulations can increase the likelihood of deportation, making it harder for certain individuals to apply, Frost said.  Outside efforts and increased funding to ground organizations can provide individuals who have experienced human trafficking with some of the help they need.  Nonprofit organizations like Journey Out and clubs similar to LA Stop the Traffik work to combat human trafficking from the ground. For example, Alyssa Gordon, fourth-year international development studies student and president of LA Stop the Traffik, said the club includes educational presentations given every week in general meetings and holds workshops for survivors of trafficking.   Additional   efforts from organizations like Journey Out and similar nonprofits provide direct services to adult survivors through emergency housing, clinical counseling, food and clothing, job training and survivor mentorship.   Common misconceptions    While there is a push for stricter regulation and stronger advocacy against human trafficking, common misconceptions and inaccurate data can overshadow the truth, David said. For instance,   a popular and often dangerous misconception includes doubting the   pervasiveness of the human trafficking industry.  &#8220;Usually what I tell people is LA is such a big hub for trafficking, and a lot of people are surprised by that I think because we still see trafficking as more of an international, a more broad, issue when it&#8217;s really not,"" Gordon said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really here in LA, with trafficking in the fashion district as well as sex trafficking on Sepulveda (Boulevard). So I do think it hits closer to home and our community.&#8221;  While trafficking involving bringing foreign victims into the U.S. is a common practice, it is only the tip of the iceberg, David said.   Trafficking can take advantage of online platforms, reaching individuals through the sites they may use every day, and it is not limited to disadvantaged neighborhoods &#8211; it can happen to anyone, anytime, Frost said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not you being kidnapped out of a van, it&#8217;s understanding the dynamics of healthy relationships and unhealthy relationships, and understanding how to look for the signs of someone who is a potential trafficker,&#8221; Frost said.     Frost also said a lot of trafficking takes place online and in pornography and modeling industries, with Los Angeles being a particularly large hotspot for these businesses.  Additionally, trafficking in the news and other depictions in the media oftentimes   only cover the surface of human trafficking's pervasiveness, because the data and statistics do not account for the trafficked individuals who do not report or receive help for their case.  While resources are certainly an important platform to look to as a baseline for understanding trafficking statistics, numbers reported by hotlines and organizations are not always representative of trafficking's reality,   David said.  &#8220;We have to remember that people of color are in particular much more hesitant to call those hotlines because of ties to law enforcement or perceived ties to law enforcement,   ...   particularly if they are worried about their immigration status or just past trauma or stigma in encounters with law enforcement,&#8221; David   said.   How to help   There are many ways individuals can help, starting with simply familiarizing oneself with what human trafficking is about. Helping victims can be accomplished in many ways, such as lending a hand to organizations assisting the human trafficking advocacy movement, supporting events in your local area or donating to advocacy groups, David said.  &#8220;If you're good at finances, maybe it means assisting a nonprofit with any accounting needs, maybe it&#8217;s helping a client (learn how to) open a bank account or how to balance a checkbook,&#8221; David   said. &#8220;There are ways for medical students who want to provide free checkups. ... We need advocates in all spaces.""  Similarly, making conscious decisions in your purchases, specifically the clothes you buy, are important steps towards limiting the drive for labor trafficking, Gordon said.   Fast fashion  refers to trendy clothing that is rapidly made and cheaply sold. Because of its need for quick and inexpensive manufacturing, the demand for cheap forced labor makes it one of the leading industries contributing to human trafficking. Limiting fast fashion purchases and buying responsibly made clothes made to last may be a pricier decision, but can   ultimately save lives.  &#8220;Momentary trends ... end up fueling these really, really economically lucrative processes that enslave people,"" Frost said.   Making conscious decisions and aiding relief efforts may help get our world to the point where human life is no longer associated with a price tag. Recognizing how the trafficking industry is a lucrative business profiting off vulnerable members of any community is important in understanding its severity, Frost said.   ""(Trafficking) is by many people treated as a business endeavor. ... It is very much a growing industry and not just something we are fighting and getting over.""

But while some portrayals successfully shine a light on mental health conditions, others merely perpetuate   stigmas and stereotypes.   Columnist Alissa Evans puts her cognitive science degree to use in Silver Screen Psychology, comparing movies and shows that boast accurate depictions of mental health to those that sacrifice authenticity for drama.     Warning: spoilers ahead.   One in five people will experience a major depressive episode at some point in their lives, according to Dr. Kate Wolitzky-Taylor  and the silver screen offers a space to explore the mental illness.  Depression is one of the most widespread mental illnesses, said Wolitzky-Taylor, associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and associate faculty in the Anxiety and Depression Research Center. The prevalence of depression in the real world is reflected in popular media like ""Euphoria,"" ""13 Reasons Why"" and ""A Star Is Born.""   While the way it is portrayed may vary from film to film, Wolitzky-Taylor said depression is usually marked by a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities or a consistent feeling of sadness that persists for at least two weeks. The underlying causes of depression can range from stressful life events to biological predispositions, Wolitzky-Taylor said, and generally cannot be boiled down to a mere chemical imbalance.  ""There has been research showing that people who buy into that chemical imbalance model have lower expectancy that something like cognitive behavioral therapy can help because they assume, Oh, I just need to fix the chemicals in my brain,'"" Wolitzky-Taylor said.   [Related:    Documentary works to destigmatize mental health in Asian-American community   ]   Films that are seemingly simple like ""Inside Out"" can help refute such misconceptions and educate audiences about depression. The main character Riley is not necessarily experiencing a major depressive episode, Wolitzky-Taylor said, nor does Inside Out explicitly claim to be a film about mental health. Nevertheless, Wolitzky-Taylor said Rileys struggles to acclimate to life in a new city resemble multiple aspects of depression. Over the course of the film, her general disposition changes from cheerful to withdrawn and pessimistic, she gives up past interests like hockey and she begins acting out toward her parents.  Even after Joy returns to headquarters, Rileys memories do not revert back to perfectly happy ones, but instead become a mixture of happiness and sadness. Wolitzky-Taylor said ""Inside Out"" shows that all emotions serve a purpose, and people like Riley who do not allow themselves to feel sadness will live with negative psychological consequences.  Riley eventually rediscovers joy, but only after she properly grieves the old life she's lost. ""Inside Out"" therefore avoids the reductive trend in films like Silver Linings Playbook, where characters completely overcome their mental illnesses through love and pure strength of will.  Also circumventing the oversimplified recovery trope is the film ""Manchester by the Sea,"" which offers a more harrowing look at depression. Lee, who finds himself suddenly responsible for his teenage nephew Patrick, has lived with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder ever since an unthinkable tragedy dismantled his family. He is totally withdrawn, unwilling and unable to connect with others and prone to violent outbursts.  Although Patrick breaks down some of Lees protective walls, Lees trauma remains largely unresolved by the end of the film. Instead, he and Patrick arrive at a compromise regarding Patricks guardianship, providing a semblance of hope while still remaining true to the often ongoing nature of severe, untreated depression. Wolitzky-Taylor said depression waxes and wanes, and while some might experience periods of time without symptoms, others, like Lee, may live with more chronic depression.   [Related:    Second Take: Bojack Horseman avoids tired tropes, offers nuanced take of addiction   ]   When films try too hard to avoid the oversimplified recovery trope, however, they run the risk of preaching an even more dangerous falsehood  that there is no way to beat depression. That damaging message underlies shows like 13 Reasons Why and films like A Star Is Born, both of which suggest that suicide is not only a viable solution to depression, but perhaps the only solution.  ""A Star Is Born"" emphasizes rockstar Jackson Maine's hopelessness, which can be a  documented sign  of depression and a warning sign for suicide. His despondence stems from his addiction to alcohol and opioids, as well as the perception that he's hindering his fiance Ally's career. The  final scene , in which Ally  now a full-fledged star  commemorates her husband in front of a packed theater implies Jacksons suicide ultimately aided her ascent to stardom. Despite his family's obvious mourning, the focus on Allys success after Jacksons death and the portrait of him as a martyr contribute to the glorification of suicide.  However, perhaps an even more problematic trend is the romanticization of suicide as a means to exact revenge. The first season of 13 Reasons Why"" uses this concept as it chronicles the life and death of Hannah Baker, who leaves behind 13 tapes addressed to the people who allegedly contributed to her suicide.  Before her death, Hannah exhibits feelings of worthlessness and emptiness, suicidal thoughts and social withdrawal  all of which Wolitzky-Taylor said are symptoms of depression. Hannah even reaches out to a school counselor, whose failure to alert the proper services or offer any kind of support may have  d  iscouraged  viewers from seeking help.  The show's revenge narrative  as well as the graphic depiction of rape and suicide  may also be potentially damaging to at-risk youth. After the shows initial release in 2017, one  study  found that the suicide rate among 10- to 17-year-olds in the United States increased by 28.9%.  Experts  say the correlation could be because of the shows visually explicit suicide scene, which presents the act as a concrete and feasible option to those who already experience suicidal ideation.  As per the recommendation of multiple mental health experts, Netflix  edited  the suicide scene two years after season ones premiere. It may have been too late, however. The media's impact is wide-reaching, and upcoming movies and shows must be mindful about their portrayals of depression and suicide, especially.  But despite portraits like ""13 Reasons Why"" and ""A Star Is Born,"" Wolitzky-Taylor said there are many effective treatments for depression, including cognitive-behavioral therapy  which helps people to rework negative thought patterns  and antidepressants. Shows like 13 Reasons Why should first consider depicting the efficacy of such treatments, and then ensure their foundational research is airtight before submitting to Netflix for millions to see.  Because even seemingly innocuous portrayals can have consequences more dangerous than stigma.",['cap-alissa-evans'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/ae.courtesy.jpg

Bradley will be responsible for maintaining an inclusive space for all UCLA personnel through means such as diversity initiatives, training and education, research, policy initiatives and more, said Emily Carter, the executive vice chancellor and provost, in an emailed statement to the campus Monday.&nbsp;    The search for a new EDI vice chancellor began after Jerry Kang announced his    intent to step down    from the role by June 30 in a statement released in September. The university formed a    search committee    in November to conduct a nationwide search for the next candidate, consisting of faculty from across campus.    The EDI vice chancellor is tasked with overseeing the Title IX Office, Discrimination Prevention Office and BruinX, as well as with helping to ensure fair hiring practices and develop programs to promote undergraduate and graduate diversity.    UCLA created the EDI vice chancellor position in 2014 after an    external investigation    alleged that UCLAs response to incidents of bias and discrimination was inadequate.    Bradley will be the second person to hold the EDI vice chancellor position.    Bradley was previously a lecturer at the UCLA School of Law and the deputy director of the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations before serving as the   assistant vice provost for faculty development and diversity at the University of Colorado Boulder.    Carter said that, as an expert in human rights and international law and an educator with experience in diversity initiatives and policy development, Bradley is uniquely suited for the position.    Bradley said in an emailed statement that she is honored to be appointed to   the position and will commit herself to the values of equity, diversity and inclusion.    I believe a universitys greatest strength is its people, Bradley said. I look forward to building relationships and collaborating with students, staff, faculty, alumni and the broader UCLA community to advance these values in authentic ways.

However, for many older adults, social isolation is far from a new concept.  There are  approximately  49 million people who are 65 years or older in the U.S. Before the COVID-19 became a pandemic, many older Americans were already socially isolated, which increased their likelihood of developing dementia, heart disease and depression. Now, the stay-at-home state directive affects 5.3 million senior citizens in California.  While social isolation and loneliness are not the same, stay-at-home orders exacerbate the degradation of mental and physical health for older adults.  Social isolation is the objective physical separation from social environments like we're seeing in stay-at-home orders, while loneliness is the subjective feeling of being alone. A UCSF  study  found that 43% of older adults felt lonely, while only 18% live alone.  At UCLA, researchers have suggested that policymakers attempt to reduce barriers to mental health services for these demographics. In addition, multiple medical centers at UCLA have expanded outreach through telehealth platforms.  UCLA already has the infrastructure, but now they need to do the outreach. Expanding telehealth platforms and increasing education on how to navigate these platforms would enable senior residents, especially those who are socially isolated, to be identified and cared for. Not only would providing strengthened telehealth resources increase accessibility, but increasing public education would also help younger generations contribute to the wellbeing of seniors in such an isolating environment.  The California Mental Health Older Adult System of Care Project conducted by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research proposes policy recommendations to reduce barriers to public mental health care, including unmet basic needs such as food, housing and transportation.  But now, it's a matter of increasing accessibility older adults who are unable to reach services.   Research  shows that individuals who feel lonely may actually have a weakened immune system to fight off viruses, making them more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Social isolation may impact seniors mobility and physical capabilities to do things on their own due to functional decline.  Theres a relationship between social isolation and mental health concerns like depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation that all have been associated with the experience of social isolation, said Kathryn Kietzman, a senior research scientist at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.  Not only does this correlation necessitate better outreach to elderly communities via existing telehealth services, it also means UCLA has a role to play in educating the public about the impact of social isolation on seniors' mental health as well.  Living alone with cognitive impairment poses even more difficulties and risks of social isolation. A  study  showed that participants with Alzheimers disease explained how their friends were less interested to spend time with them after they shared their diagnosis.  And now that physical separation is mandated by state law, the risks associated with social isolation are magnified.  (Older adults with early dementia) still understand the importance of meeting up with people and going out, so I think the stay-at-home orders become harder to process,"" said Lourdes Guerrero, an adjunct assistant professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine and program director of the intergenerational support program TimeOut@UCLA.  Expanding online health services is no easy task, but UCLA already has a foot in the door, and many mental health and wellness services have already shifted to online platforms. The UCLA Longevity Center at the Semel Institute hosts webinars to promote healthy aging in place. On Wednesday, Dr. Gary Small and Dr. Linda Ercoli hosted a  webinar  discussing strategies for living better longer and reducing mind health risks.   The UCLA Health division of geriatric psychiatry has transitioned to a telehealth platform.  But these local services need to be better publicized to reach a greater number of older adults in the LA area  and providing increased public education is a good place to start.  Many older adults face barriers to using  technology  which may stem from a lack of guidance or knowledge. Often, the responsibility falls on younger generations to educate older adults on how to use the technological resources available.  I think people have been very adept at adapting to the new normal, said Small, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science and geriatric psychiatrist. Were finding it can be quite effective, although many of our older patients are not so computer savvy, and they have a hard time with the video conferencing.  Guerrero suggests that UCLA students could help create tutorials or lessons on how to use technologies and social media platforms. She also encourages students to set up wellness checks with older adults in their life.  Intergenerational support is important because it taps into the lived experiences of the older adults and that can come across as wisdom for the younger adults, Guerrero said.  Providing older adults with a support network, promoting intergenerational connections and connecting seniors with telemental health services can help maintain their wellbeing. And with all the resources at hand, UCLA can work to educate and support this community through expansive outreach.  Clearly, this pandemic has put unprecedented stress on the public health system, as workers focus on detecting and treating vulnerable individuals with COVID-19. Mental health is often overlooked as a health concern when the majority of the focus has been on mitigating the virus. But while hospital workers focus on the immediate impacts of the virus, the UCLA community can do crucial work behind the scenes in the form of increased resources and education.  Reaching out to those in need can feel difficult without face-to-face interaction.  But we can make a difference for the most vulnerable members of our community  even if it's just with a Zoom tutorial.",['cap-angela-hana'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/covidelders.jpg

UCLA&#8217;s shift to online instruction and statewide stay-at-home orders decreased the number of potential customers for businesses.   Andrew Thomas, executive director of the Westwood Village Improvement Association, said long-existing regulations have cost businesses money and energy, discouraging some businesses from operating in Westwood.   &#8220;Before the shutdown, we were, as a district, trending in the right direction, albeit slowly,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;Then COVID-19 hit and our economy shut down almost entirely. It's just such a unique time right now, I don't feel that the dust from this economic bomb is actually going to settle for several months, so it's hard to say what the true impacts are going to be long term.&#8221;   Thomas said Westwood&#8217;s grocery stores have been more successful than ever, and other essential businesses like Target are also fairing well. Some retail businesses, which could not allow customers inside to shop, have adopted online order and curbside pickup strategies.  However, public health regulations have had different effects on restaurants, Thomas said. Those that functioned largely on dine-out, to-go or delivery orders are mostly doing better than those that depended on customers dining in, he said.  &#8220;There are other businesses playing catch up, but many have adapted quickly and increased their online presence,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;There's some that have really started to pivot to try to manage online food ordering, pick-up and delivery. People are adapting.&#8221;  Alex Kim, the store manager of Ami Japanese restaurant, said that transitioning to takeout is keeping the restaurant afloat. Kim said he shifted promotions like happy hour, which were previously only for dine-in customers, to be applicable to take-out, and now also runs promotions through delivery apps like UberEats and Grubhub. Additional promotions are available for front-line workers, first responders and UCLA students, he added.   &#8220;Our main consumers are students, so they left and it&#8217;s pretty slow, but at the same time, all of the hospital workers and front-line workers and people who live around here, they&#8217;ve been trying to help us out and order with us as much as possible,&#8221; Kim said.  Ami is still operating seven days a week and has installed extra hand-sanitizer stations and guards for when they are able to seat customers again, Kim said. As of right now, it is unclear when that will be because of safety concerns, but Kim said he hopes that when it is safe, UCLA and surrounding offices will be open and provide more foot traffic to Ami and other restaurants in the area.  While the pandemic has yet to directly cause any permanent closures, it did accelerate the shutdown of Stan&#8217;s Donuts, which served Westwood and its visitors for 55 years. Owner Stan Berman said in a statement on the store&#8217;s website that he had already planned to retire, but his decision was expedited to avoid operating business during the pandemic.    [Related link:    Stan&#8217;s Donuts to close after 55 years of business, citing COVID-19   ]    Meanwhile, Rocco&#8217;s Tavern plans to reopen when it is safe and can accommodate safety protocols, owner Josh Trifunovic said.   ""Rocco's is not going anywhere and we will be ready to serve UCLA and the surrounding community once again,&#8221; Trifunovic said. &#8220;We will definitely need the support from everyone when we do open, so please come by and say hello.""  Despite being closed to customers, Rocco&#8217;s joined other popular Westwood Village restaurants in providing free lunches to UCLA front-line workers through a GoFundMe established by WVIA. More than $10,000 has been donated to the fund, and Thomas said that WVIA has completed two rounds of meal disbursements.   Thomas said Los Angeles must take steps to promote public safety in conjunction with economic development as the city reopens. A number of motions have been introduced and are being brought to committee in the city council to make reopening easier, less time-consuming and less expensive, he added. Thomas said expanding outdoor dining in Westwood is critical, and that limitations that have thwarted village businesses in the past should be set aside.   &#8220;As an organization, we've been talking specifically about measures that we can take to support and facilitate recovery of the district, and I hope what comes out of that conversation is a series of recommendations that we would make to the city to try to kick start recovery in the district,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;But it's on us now. ... We've got to come together or we&#8217;re going to be in trouble.&#8221;  Thomas said that while Westwood is making progress, the current state of the Village is merely the tip of the iceberg in terms of economic devastation.   Tenants receive rent forbearance under the eviction moratorium of the emergency ordinance. However, when the pandemic is over, tenants may not be able to afford their back-rents and property owners may not be able to afford their mortgages, and Thomas said that will incur long-term effects on the Village.  He said he expects more losses of businesses, especially if people from the UCLA community are not present when businesses need to compensate for months of missed revenue.  &#8220;When the shutdown is lifted, it's probably going to get worse before it gets better,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;But if we don't get together and make things easier for our community, we might not have a Village to come back to. It might be completely unrecognizable.&#8221; ",['cap-eve-gross-sable'],"['news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.ns_.A.covidbusinesses.MC_.jpg

The mobile app was founded by Ariana Anderson of the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, who oversees a team of researchers composed of students and staff who analyze audio and demographic data from the app. Initially intended to alert deaf parents that their children are crying, the project received first prize in UCLAs 2016 Code for the Mission competition and was launched as an app in 2018. Fourth-year biology student Bianca Dang, the research coordinator for the project, said ChatterBaby collects the audio of a babys cries via their parents phones and compares it to sounds in the apps database servers at UCLA to predict why the baby is crying.  Its a daunting and scary time, especially when you're a new parent, Dang said. The bottom line is we want both parents, not just the mother, to be able to interact with their baby better and more effectively. ... We want to improve communication between parents and their newborn children.  She said the app correctly captures crying 90% of the time. In doing so, it predicts three reasons for crying: hunger, fussiness and pain. For example, she said a baby continuously crying with high energy indicates pain, whereas a cry with more periods of silence is more likely due to fussiness.   [Related:    App developed by students allows users to track boba purchases, unites community   ]     Robert Dennis, director of the Computing Technologies Research Lab, said Anderson created several algorithms to enhance its effectiveness, such as initially being able to tell whether a recorded sound is a cry rather than background noise. If the sound is indeed a cry, Dang said artificial intelligence and algorithms then compute certain acoustic characteristics  including strength, duration and the amount of silence  to predict the type. Dennis said the app is essentially a machine-learning system because the algorithms are periodically refined through statistical analysis. As a result, the algorithms accuracy improves as more utterances are received from babies.  While the app predicts why an infant is crying, Dang said the collected data are also utilized in an ongoing research study exploring how babies cries can indicate neurodevelopmental conditions like autism. She said this line of investigation was inspired by known disorders that can be diagnosed by the sound of a newborns cry. For example, Dang said cri-du-chat syndrome, or cat's cry syndrome, can be detected in a baby purely based on its distinctive catlike sound.  (Anderson) began to see there was not only the ability to discern crying due to a (fussy) baby versus a baby in pain but (also) as she got more data, she was able to see patterns more pathological in nature, Dennis said. Its way too early to say, but this can become a valuable diagnostic tool that could lead to a lot of interesting therapies.  The idea that a cry can allude to future health implications of a newborn  coupled with the fact that autism is usually not detected in children until after the age of 3  is a driving force for the apps investigative effort, Dang said.   [Related:    Student creates mobile app to help students better discuss mental health   ]   In addition to finding correlations between cries and babies who are on the autism spectrum, Dang said the app also allows users to partake in anonymous, free surveys. These include demographic and autism screening surveys adapted from questions used in autism screenings at doctors' visits.  Autistic children are more likely to be from households of lower incomes, (minorities), Hispanic families in particular, Dang said. We created these surveys with the demographics in mind of kids who are diagnosed with autism most severely ... and highly unlikely to go to the doctor.  Third-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student Solne Poulhazan, who translated the app and survey questions to French, said the surveys ask questions relating to the childs family, such as a family history of autism, the mothers education level and maternal trauma. Both the audio of cries and survey questions ultimately allow ChatterBaby to contribute to the greater field of scientific research in the hopes of changing the course of disorder diagnosis for infants, she said.  ""I think that (ChatterBaby) is a really great way to contribute to research even if you don't really see directly the impact that you're doing, Poulhazan said. You're not really face-to-face with the people, but the thing is knowing that it's going toward something that (serves) people for the greater good.",['cap-drake-gardner'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/chatterbaby.jpg

For her, what started out as a coping mechanism soon transformed into a larger project. The second-year psychobiology student&#8217;s book, &#8220;Control Mindset: An Interactive Guide to Freeing Your Mind, Taking Control, and Unlocking the Extraordinary,&#8221; which was published in February, is meant to serve as a practical guide to overcoming similar mental blocks. Khalifian said the book combines both personal narratives and interactive exercises to help guide the reader toward a mindset filled not with fear, but with hope.  &#8220;Fear is the common denominator in all the cases that people are saying 'no' to themselves or sitting back or not chasing after their dreams,&#8221; Khalifian said.   [Related:    Student self-publishes children&#8217;s book to broaden Asian American representation   ]   Her own personal journey began with a toxic cycle of self-sabotage, Khalifian said, in which she defined her self-worth purely on grades and was constantly afraid of failure and opportunities. Writing became an outlet to notice the negative trends in her thoughts, she said. The frequent introspection drove her to action and prompted her to start learning how to transform her outlook, she said.  Khalifian said the underlying logic behind the book is guided by the idea that the individual must see themselves as capable and deserving of both change and growth. The book offers a three-step approach to reach that stage of acceptance. The first is to discover one&#8217;s haves and have nots. The second is to take control of everything within one&#8217;s limits, from the internal to the external, with the last step being to recognize and rise above what one cannot control in order to move forward. Ultimately, Khalifian said the end goal is to find contentment in one&#8217;s life and welcome change when it comes.  [caption caption=""Nicolette Khalifian was inspired by her own struggle with self-doubt to write a book that could help others overcome the same issue. (Courtesy of Nicolette Khalifian)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_377826"" width=""768""]   [/caption]   Khalifian said she collaborated with Eric Koester, known as the &#8220;book professor&#8221; at Georgetown University, who began a book-publishing program in 2016 geared toward undergraduate and graduate students. Khalifian, who lives outside the District of Columbia, reached out to Koester after hearing about the class from a mutual acquaintance at Georgetown. It is largely thanks to the internet that such a setup is possible &#8211; virtual platforms like Zoom are some of the primary channels in which he meets and conducts seminars with authors from different time zones, Koester said.  The professor said he pushed Khalifian to transform her personal experience into a solid framework by seeking out others with similar stories. Following his advice, she gradually constructed the book&#8217;s philosophy by reaching out and interviewing people young and old, often through Instagram. Khalifian said she focused on doctors to demonstrate the internal struggles they have to grapple with, despite being successful according to societal standards.  &#8220;They&#8217;re still trying to figure X, Y and Z out and part of the understanding is that nothing is ever finished,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You are doing the best that you could do. And putting one foot in front of the next is really what lets people ride the wave without feeling like they're stuck in it.&#8221;  Khalifian&#8217;s publisher, Brian Bies from New Degree Press, said the confluence of her age, experience and compassion produces a valuable perspective amid the majority of middle-aged veteran authors in the self-help genre. He said she brings a youthful optimism to the table, which helps the book resonate with younger audiences.   [Related:    Student publishes book exploring influence of law clerks on US judicial system   ]   Another core feature of her book lies in the carefully crafted exercises, Bies said. The book contains a mixture of simple straightforward questions meant to induce thoughtful introspections, Khalifian said, as well as writing exercises to help cultivate the desired mindset.  For example, readers are prompted after each section to write out their feelings and habits in first-person present tense. Khalifian said the particular syntactic structure is meant to help the person consciously affirm their worth, enabling them to start taking control of their situation.  [caption caption=""&quot;Control Mindset&quot; is meant to help guide the reader toward a mindset filled not with fear, but with hope.(Courtesy of Nicolette Khalifian)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_377827"" width=""822""]   [/caption]   There are also open-ended exercises such as dissecting bad habits and their roots, which provides a practical element for readers to engage in. The first step is recognizing a bad habit the reader wants to improve, such as phone addiction. The second is pinpointing the resource that fuels this habit, such as the phone and notifications that constantly provide stimulation. The third is to find alternative ways of attaining stimulation, such as by reading a book, which can vary from person to person, she said.  &#8220;I think if you gave people the opportunity to act on what they're reading then they're really able to put to work what they're learning,&#8221; Khalifian said.  Khalifian said the aforementioned exercises and lessons can be particularly beneficial to people around her age who may be struggling with their academics or are afraid of pursuing their passions. However, she said anyone with similar sentiments of self-doubt and uncertainty can relate to the book. There is no definitive learning curve in life, Khalifian said, as some adults make the same mistakes that teenagers make. The book, in her view, is meant for anyone who wants to face the world in a fearless and limitless way, she said.  &#8220;I just really hope readers feel encouraged to push harder, to understand their true potential, to know they're capable and that no one is stuck,"" Khalifian said. ""Take away these key lessons that your mind is what you can do with it, and there's truly nothing holding you back unless you view it as an obstacle.&#8221; ",['cap-alyson-kong'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/3-1024x683.jpeg

Alumna Rachel Forrest is conducting socially distant graduation photoshoots for students during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said. Since she wore a face mask during her shoots, Forrest said she was initially worried that covering her face would make her subjects feel intimidated and shy. Instead,   Forrest said she makes an even greater effort to verbally communicate with clients during photoshoots to pose them and help them feel more comfortable in front of the camera.  &#8220;Sometimes I get the urge (to) fix someone&#8217;s sash or do something, but I need to just tell them what to do so I don't have to engage in contact with them,&#8221; Forrest said.   A common pose for graduation photoshoots is having subjects throw their sash toward her camera, Forrest said, since the movement gives life to the picture. While learning better communication techniques through her socially distanced photoshoot experiences, Forrest said she also discovered how to better manage her own time and personal limits when it comes to her craft and scheduling shoots.  &#8220;Over time, (I) had to deal with a lot of issues like budgeting, figuring out how much am I going to charge for photos and how much is my time worth,&#8221; Forrest said. &#8220;Being able to learn how to advocate for myself over the years has also been really important.&#8221;   [caption caption=""Taking proper precautions, Forrest said she makes an even greater effort to verbally communicate with clients to help them feel more comfortable in front of the camera.

Forrest said she was originally worried how this would affect the quality of how the photos turn out. The challenge instead comes from the closures of campus buildings, she said, presenting problems to those who wanted photos in select locations. Forrest said she can no longer perform sessions with clients in study spots, like inside Powell Library, that capture their memories of spending countless hours   working toward their degrees in a single photo.    [Related:    Illustrations provide medium for graduating students to commemorate college   ]   In need of a photographer for a graduation photoshoot, Ryan Chung was recommended to Forrest by a friend, he said.   The fourth-year environmental science student said Forrest took photos from varying angles and distances, such as wide-angle and close-up shots, helping him capture his graduation memories. Although Chung said he didn't need much help with posing for photos, Forrest edited shots from the session well, helping him fix the lighting and removing blemishes. Although Chung wanted his photos taken in his major&#8217;s department office, he said Forrest instead took his pictures outside of the facility, abiding by new campus closure policies.  &#8220;I needed (the photos) to commemorate (my major) by doing a really weird pose outside the office,&#8221; Chung said. &#8220;It was just for laughs and jokes, and it turned out to be pretty good (and) fun.&#8221;   After finding Forrest through a Facebook Marketplace posting,   fourth-year international development studies student Asha Kadakia has returned several times for shoots with the photographer. Kadakia said Forrest was      both supportive and helpful when it came to directing her form.  &#8220;I think some people get nervous taking graduation photos because they&#8217;re supposed to a big deal,&#8221; Kadakia said. &#8220;But (Forrest) was really sweet and her photos turned out incredible.&#8221;    [Related:    UCLA moves spring graduation ceremonies online to curb spread of COVID-19   ]   Although sometimes needing to perform sessions for clients at 6 a.m. is difficult, Forrest said she values how her shoots allow her to interact with others during the pandemic.

Though Forrest adores when clients post her photos on social media, she also appreciates when her work is used to celebrate success with loved ones.  &#8220;It's super sweet to see my clients post on social media,"" Forrest said.

The Board of Regents discussed the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak and the use of standardized testing in admissions during the meeting.   Tuesday     Special Committee on Basic Needs    Aidan Arasasingham, government relations committee chair of the UC Student Association and a third-year global studies student at UCLA, addressed the need to protect students from housing and food insecurity amid the COVID-19 crisis. He urged the UC to act on key basic needs interventions, such as paid administrative leave for UC workers and legal support for students who live off campus and want to leave campus but are unable to terminate their leases.  Arasasingham added he thinks the UC should also ensure health care and Counseling and Psychological Services remain accessible to students.  Pamela Brown, the vice president for Institutional Research and Academic Planning at the UC Office of the President, delivered a report on food and housing insecurity and academic results. Brown said students who reported food insecurities also said they have competing family responsibilities, feel depressed and are unable to focus on their work.  Alumni Regent William Um proposed improving UC&#8217;s food pantries in response to the food insecurities caused by COVID-19. Um said the UC could allow its students to access food pantries on any of its campuses and potentially partner with other California universities to make more food pantries available to UC students.    Wednesday    Nataly Morales, a graduate student at UC Riverside, and Clare Glavin, a third-year political science student at UCLA, said they are opposed to raising tuition. They said that tuition is already high and that, as a graduate student and out-of-state student, respectively, they do not receive enough financial aid. Regent Chair John P&#233;rez announced he was removing the vote on the tuition increase from the regents&#8217; agenda because of the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Uriah Blackwell, a fourth-year African American studies and environmental science student at UCLA, and other activists and students called on the regents to divest from the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. They argue that building the TMT will desecrate the sacred land of Mauna Kea and cause violence against the indigenous people who live there.  Aidan Hill, a 2020 Berkeley mayoral candidate, asked the UC Regents not to build housing on People&#8217;s Park located in Berkeley. Maxina Ventura, a People&#8217;s Park activist, said the park is a historical site and is an open green space that can provide shelter for people in need and can be used as a meeting place in times of emergency.  Liz Perlman, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, and Kathryn Lybarger, president of AFSCME Local 3299, said they are planning to retrain workers to help in the health care system to aid in dealing with COVID-19. UC President Janet Napolitano said she and the UC Office of the President have been in discussion with union leaders about this idea.  Paul Jenny, interim executive vice president and chief financial officer for the UC, said the UC is not currently planning to provide students enrolling for spring quarter refunds of mandatory fees and tuition. However, the UC will continue to assess the current rates of tuition, he added.    Compliance and Audit Committee    The committee approved the external audit plan for the year ending June 30.  Alexander Bustamante, senior vice president and chief compliance and audit officer at the UC Office of the President, and Matt Hicks, systemwide deputy audit officer, presented an update on the systemwide audit of admissions. The audit began its second phase Feb. 14. Its first phase sought to assess the admissions process and find gaps, and it resulted in 34 recommendations to further reduce the possibility of admissions fraud.  The second phase of the audit found inadequate documentation for admissions decisions and approvals, insufficient efforts to verify application details, access to system data by those who were not pertinent to the process, and a lack of follow up with admissions via a centralized system, in particular with special talent admissions.  Bustamante and Hicks plan to have implemented the corrective measures for phase two by July. The state audit on the matter is set to be released in August.     Public Engagement and Development Committee    The committee recommended endorsement for UC Berkeley&#8217;s fundraising campaign, called Light the Way. The campaign will prioritize the creation of 100 new faculty positions, 300 graduate fellowships and various projects to enhance the undergraduate experience at UC Berkeley.  The committee also recommended endorsement for a measure to authorize bonds to continue funding for stem cell research. If the measure is successful in collecting enough signatures, it will appear on the November ballot in California.     Academic and Student Affairs Committee    The committee voted to defer its entire agenda to the May meeting since the chair was absent.     Finance and Capital Strategies Committee    Paul Jenny, interim executive vice president and chief financial officer for the UC, called on each UC campus chancellor to consider ways to protect their universities from significant financial hardships that will likely come from an economic downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  The committee discussed the possibility of expanding UC hospitals and allowing beds to be used for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in order to compensate for the currently limited hospital space in California.  With the current state of financial turmoil, the committee decided to postpone decisions regarding funding for projects until its May meeting, choosing instead to focus on a plan of recovery for the UC following the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.     Thursday    Audrey Dow, senior vice president of The Campaign for College Opportunity, said the organization is opposed to the continued use of the ACT and SAT in admissions decisions. She added that the tests only tell how much privilege or test preparation students have been able to afford.  Christina Manzano, a doctoral student in the physics and astronomy department at UC Riverside, said she uses the telescopes on Mauna Kea in her research. However, she added that, as an astronomer, she does not think the Thirty Meter Telescope is essential for advancing science. She urged the regents to divest from the TMT project.  Alex Vermie, a research analyst from Teamsters Local 2010, which represents about 12,000 UC workers, said the union welcomes UC President Janet Napolitano&#8217;s decision to provide two weeks of paid administrative leave to workers in light of the coronavirus outbreak. However, he added that the program needs to be expanded because the crisis is likely to last much longer than two weeks.  UC Student Association President Varsha Sarveshwar, a fourth-year political science student at UC Berkeley, said the UC needs to prioritize the financial well-being of students during the COVID-19 outbreak by providing on-campus student workers with paid administrative leave and providing emergency loans and other financial support for students who have been laid off for off-campus work.  Sarveshwar added that the UC needs to acknowledge that the abrupt shift to online learning is difficult. She said she doesn't think it makes sense to continue with the A-F letter grading system, adding she believes the UC should allow students to switch classes to a pass/no pass grading option until the end of spring semester or quarter.  Connor Strobel, president of the UC Graduate and Professional Council and a sociology doctoral student at UC Irvine, said graduate students&#8217; research have been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Strobel said many students cannot access labs or meet in person, and thus may not graduate on time. Strobel asked the UC to extend funding and housing guarantees for students who can demonstrate an impact on their research or an inability to progress toward their degrees.  Michael Brown, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, and Sylvia Hurtado, an education professor at UCLA, presented information about the UC&#8217;s history with admissions tests. Regent Michael Cohen suggested the board invite experts in the field to provide counteropinions on admissions tests when the board discusses the tests further at its May meeting.

With the COVID-19 pandemic shutting down much of the world's daily operations, not only have all UCLA classes been moved online, but also all theater productions have been canceled or delayed to fall quarter of the next academic year.   Other previously in-person productions have been moved to podcastlike formats. Graduate directing student Mark Anthony Vallejo finished his senior thesis play right before productions halted, but some of his cohort members may not be able to finish   their theses, originally having been slated for spring quarter.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not the way I wanted (spring quarter) to be,&#8221; Vallejo said. &#8220;I really wanted it to be fun and relaxed, but I&#8217;d rather be safe and have my friends be safe than for (UCLA) to force us to be on campus.&#8221;   [Related:    Transition to online class poses unique challenges for TFT students, instructors   ]   In addition to these losses, theater classes had only a week to adapt to an online format over spring break. While some already-online theater classes and voice and theory classes easily adjusted to virtual learning, other classes that involve significant physical interaction or movement have faced difficulties in their new structure.   For instance, graduate acting student Newt Arlandiz's Aikido martial art elective will only be focused on theory for the spring, and actual physical practice has been delayed until school starts in-person again. Moreover, graduate acting student David Kepner has had special topic acting classes and short film collaborations with the film department postponed until in-person classes resume, and what originally was a television set collaboration class has turned into a self-taped audition   course.  Nevertheless, some in the UCLA theater community are finding ways to navigate these challenges. What started as a joke on a video call between second-year theater students Jacob Cherry, Jake Goldfarb, Julia Ribas and Rachel Stubington turned into a two-hour-long production of &#8220;The Sound of Music"" on video conference application Zoom.  After holding scriptwriting sessions and rehearsals, the group performed the musical live for an audience of around 50 people, Ribas said. Since posting the  recording on YouTube , the video  has gained the attention of  former The Juilliard School staff accompanist Kevin Lynch and garnered more than 900 views. Albeit very different from live theater, Ribas said making the musical online was the next best solution to keeping their art alive in such times.  &#8220;We&#8217;re just trying to work on our art in any way we can,&#8221;   Ribas said. &#8220;But if you look at the different resources that there are out there, then there are plenty of things that you can do to work on yourself and your art, and I think that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve been able to find together.&#8221;   [Related:    Shakespeare Company to exit stage and enter airwaves for radio spring plays   ]   The new online theater group is turning lemons into lemonade through its Zoom productions, Lynch said. Despite audio difficulties &#8211; especially with the Zoom audio lag   when singing &#8211; Ribas said they embraced their mistakes as they would in live theater. Additionally, although they initially didn&#8217;t think Zoom would have the same audience interaction and feedback, Cherry said they could feel the audience&#8217;s presence through the live Zoom chat feature.  &#8220;It was hard this quarter not being able to get to perform or to see the shows we were expecting to see,&#8221; Cherry said. &#8220;It&#8217;ll still be hard for us, but to even give people a taste of just something fun and a show for all ages in this time when people just need to laugh and smile, I think that&#8217;s really cool.&#8221;  T  he Zoom musical presents a different kind of entertainment for those bored of spending time on apps such as TikTok and YouTube, Goldfarb said. Although the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television has been working on more productions for the fall, he also thinks the added time in people&#8217;s lives will allow them to pursue new projects and allow for both the theater and overarching school community to better connect.  The group is far from done with its Zoom theater productions and is already rehearsing for its next musical, ""High School Musical,"" to be performed week three on Zoom, Ribas said. And although only time will tell how the future of many theater productions, projects and classes will pan out, s  he said the group will keep finding ways to keep the art alive &#8211; even virtually.    ""Even if the world seems like it&#8217;s at a standstill, there are always things that we can do individually to bring hope to people and to make the world a better place,"" Ribas said.

No. 5 UCLA baseball (13-2) will play a three-game series against Oregon (8-7) to kick off its Pac-12 campaign. The Bruins are looking to win back-to-back conference titles for the first time ever, after taking home the crown last season with a 24-5 conference record &#8211; their best in program history.  Despite losing 13 players to the 2019 MLB Draft, the Bruins  will begin conference play a game better than it did last season;  UCLA was 12-3 when they hosted Oregon State in the opening series a year ago.  Coach John Savage&#8217;s team has gotten production from new faces in its first 15 games, with redshirt freshman first baseman JT Schwartz and freshman utility Michael Curialle both finishing nonconference action in the top-five on the team in hits &#8211; even with the latter missing five games because of injury. Curialle is also tied for second on the team in home runs with two.  Returning Bruins have also played key roles for Savage&#8217;s squad, with sophomore shortstop Matt McLain and junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell being first and second on the team in batting average, respectively, and junior right-hander Zach Pettway boasting a 3-0 record with a 1.05 ERA.  McLain &#8211; who hit .203 as a freshman a year ago &#8211; is batting .397 with a .621 slugging percentage, both good for the team lead. He also leads the team in hits, home runs and is tied with Mitchell for most extra base hits.  Pettway has made four starts for UCLA, going at least six innings in each outing. The righty has allowed no more than two earned runs in a start and only one earned run since Feb. 14 &#8211; the first game of the season &#8211; against UC Riverside. He will likely get the ball to begin the series against Oregon on Friday.  The Bruins have outscored their opponents 112-32 in their first 15 games, giving them a plus-80 run differential on the season.  Oregon will come to Jackie Robinson Stadium, having snapped a three-game losing streak in its last game March 8 in Honolulu against Hawai'i, winning the final game of the four-game series 13-2. The Ducks will enter conference play, having outscored their opponents by 21 runs.  Designated hitter/pitcher Kenyon Yovan has led the way for the Ducks' offense, holding team leads with a .429 batting average, four home runs and an on-base plus slugging percentage of 1.280. Yovan's numbers in those offensive categories also leads all Bruins.  Last season, UCLA and Oregon played just twice, with the Bruins winning both games in Eugene by scores of 4-2 and 6-5.  Following  UCLA&#8217;s statement Wednesday , fans will not be permitted to attend games at Jackie Robinson Stadium until after April 10, a precautionary measure amid growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. The gates will be closed to the public, with only ""essential personnel"" having access to the event.  The series will begin Friday with first pitch set for 6 p.m. at Jackie Robinson Stadium. Games two and three will take place Saturday at 2 p.m. and Sunday at 1 p.m., respectively.

Four former members of UCLA football participated in the 2020 NFL Scouting Combine over the last week: running back Joshua Kelley, cornerback Darnay Holmes, tight end Devin Asiasi and kicker JJ Molson. The Bruins sent just two representatives to Indianapolis for last year's event, but the jump back up to four falls in line with the five and six players UCLA sent in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  While player orientation, media availability and measurements took place over the first half of the week, the players took the field for workouts starting Thursday with the quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends. Asiasi was the first Bruin to make a showing, posting a 4.73-second 40-yard dash and racking up 16 reps on the bench press.  Asiasi's 40-yard dash time ranked seventh out of the 17 tight ends who ran it, with highly touted prospects Colby Parkinson and Jared Pinkney putting up times of 4.77 and 4.96 seconds, respectively. However, Asiasi's 16 bench press reps ranked second-to-last among participating tight ends and his 30.5-inch vertical jump came in dead last.  Still, the former Bruin is projected to be the first UCLA player to be selected in this year's NFL Draft, with NFL analyst Lance Zierlein rating him as a future starter within his first two seasons.  Friday boasted two Bruins on the field, but neither earned grades as high as Asiasi's.  Kelley ran a 4.49-second 40-yard dash, good for seventh among the pool of 28 running backs. His 23 reps on the bench press placed him in a tie for fifth at his position, and all of his testing numbers besides his vertical and broad jumps ranked inside the top 10 for running backs.  Another former UCLA running back, Maurice Jones-Drew, commended Kelley for his performance over the weekend and in January's Senior Bowl via a tweet Saturday morning. Zierlein, however, graded Kelley as a potential backup or special teamer in the NFL, slotting him in as a day three prospect.  Molson did not take part in any of the physical tests, but his 182-pound frame made him the smallest kicker in attendance. Zierlein rated Molson as a priority free agent, meaning the Canadian-born kicker is not projected to hear his name called come draft day.  Holmes may not have the same draft grades as Asiasi &#8211; coming into the week as a backup or special teamer alongside Kelley &#8211; but he earned the most praise of any Bruin all week.  His 4.48-second 40-yard dash was tied for 12th among 29 defensive backs, but NFL analysts Michael Robinson, Charles Davis and Hall of Famer Deion Sanders all said they were impressed by his smoothness, agility and adaptability in the route-running and coverage drills.  Holmes is projected to be a mid- to late-round selection and has been categorized as a prototypical slot corner in the NFL.  The 2020 NFL Draft will begin April 23, but none of the Bruins' top prospects are slated to come off the board on day one.

During his tenure, Kang established formal procedures for investigations involving discrimination and harassment, enhanced administrative transparency and implemented an evidence-based approach to promote diversity.  Anna Spain Bradley will succeed Kang as the next EDI vice chancellor starting Sept. 1. Bradley previously served as the assistant vice provost for faculty development and diversity at the University of Colorado Boulder.   [Related link:  UCLA appoints Anna Spain Bradley as next EDI vice chancellor ]   Kang assumed the EDI vice chancellor position in 2015 after UCLA created the office of EDI in 2014.  The  Moreno report , published in 2013, where 30 UCLA faculty voiced concerns over the deterioration of the campus racial climate, outlined the first challenges for his new office, Kang said.  The Moreno report emphasized that ... we did not have good, clear procedures or systems by which we could actually take (discrimination) claims seriously, Kang said.  Kang established formal investigation procedures for issues impacting the campus climate. His office developed procedures for  handling allegations of discrimination  and  policies  standardizing investigations of student misconduct that undermine campus inclusivity, he said.  Kang also gave testimony to the subcommittee that developed the  UC Regents principles against intolerance , which outlines the UCs response to intolerant conduct.   [Related link:  Q&amp;A: Vice Chancellor Jerry Kang discusses bureaucracy, discrimination ]   Kang said he also pushed to increase transparency in the UCLA administration through annual public accountability reports and public summaries, which provide statistics about complaints, investigations and sanctions received by the Title IX Office and the Discrimination Prevention Office.  (These reports) give crude statistics that describe who the complainant was, what the respondent was, how many get into formal investigation, how many policy barriers did you find and what rough remedies (were) actually played out, Kang said.  Kang said he conducted salary equity studies to ensure that the university properly compensated all faculty. Faculty members of color are sometimes asked to do more than other faculty members for the same pay, he added.  Kang also created BruinX, a research and development think tank that uses scientific practices to promote equal learning and working environments. One of BruinXs main goals was to increase faculty diversity by eliminating implicit bias in the hiring process, Kang said.  For example, all search committees for new faculty members must undergo implicit bias training and all search plans, applicant pools and shortlists must be verified by the EDI office before the search committee can proceed, he said.  After the university standardized these hiring policies, the gender and ethnic diversity among ladder-rank faculty at UCLA increased by 2.9% since 2014, Kang said.  Kang said he also emphasized evidence- and data-based solutions to increase diversity.  The intellectual disrespect that is often given to diversity issues is something that I ... thought was one of the reasons why we could never come to really interesting solutions, Kang said.  Monroe Gorden Jr., vice chancellor of student affairs, said Kang brought a scientific perspective to the role, which allowed UCLA to leverage different parts of the institution to ensure maximum diversity.  Having (Kang) command when he's got great expertise from a scientific perspective, when he's got a lot of experience in working with technology ... has only been a benefit, (a) positive for us, Gorden said.  Yvette Gullatt, vice provost for diversity and engagement, said Kangs legal perspective brought a strong set of principles to help guide the university's response to issues of intolerance.  Kang was known for being unafraid and fearless during his term, Gullatt said.  I think what he's been able to do to advance faculty diversity and equity (has been) extraordinary and unafraid, (especially when he) receives a lot of pushback from people who don't want to change the status quo, Gullatt said.  Michael Levine, vice chancellor for academic personnel, said Kang was especially not afraid to be transparent with his decisions.  When it comes to approaching issues that are problematic, when it comes to making decisions that may or may not be liked by all the groups that are involved, he is fearless, Levine said. He operates using the truth and transparency, and he's taught me a lot about that from just working with him.  Kangs achievements during his five-year term transformed UCLA into a model that schools across the nation look to when approaching the issue of increasing equity, diversity and inclusion, said Mariam Lam, associate vice chancellor and chief diversity officer at UC Riverside.  (Kang) is trying to find the most relevant and specific data and substantiate a lot of inequities and disparities across higher education and our system, Lam said. I think his work is very significant for not just UCLA but for the entire system in the country.  Despite his accomplishments, Kang added there is still more work to be done by the next vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion.  You can no longer (say), I just care about diversity and I'm going to tell people to care about it, Kang said. That was maybe good enough before; (it) is not good enough now, and I think I've demonstrated how an office can take that kind of rigorous approach. This is what the new normal has to be for the best EDI work in the nation.",['cap-queenie-xiang'],"['campus', 'higher-education', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/newsjerrykang.jpg

However, what originally seemed like the beginning of yet another strange roommate story may actually be attributed to something much less obscure.   Autonomous sensory meridian response, or   ASMR, describes the uniquely pleasant feeling that people get in response to specific videos or sounds. Over the last decade, this feeling has turned into a phenomenon as more and more people create and view videos intended to elicit this response.  Videos of this nature can range from complex role-play voice-overs to random acts like a person stirring a bowl of soup. ASMR videos are diverse in content because people are stimulated by different kinds of things &#8211; what triggers a response in one person may have no effect on another.   Accordingly, a quick search on YouTube yields a massive collection of ASMR content for every taste &#8211; videos from washing hair to a simulated optometrist visit to three hours of rain sounds.  The driving force behind the popularity of these videos is the sensation they allegedly produce. ASMR content has been found to create a relaxing or tingling sensation that starts in the scalp and moves through the rest of the body. Because of this sensation, these videos can help some people go to sleep.   Gabriel Rojas, a third-year international development studies student, shared a personal account of how he believed ASMR affected him.   ""I think the reason I like things like fabric sounds or scratching is maybe, when I was little, my   tia   would scratch my head, and I would go to sleep,"" Rojas said. ""So it kind of triggers back to things like that, ... like comfort and stability.""   As follows, ASMR is extremely popular &#8211; with Bruins and non-Bruins alike &#8211; but it technically didn't   exist not too long ago.  The humble beginnings of ASMR are found in a forum on the website  SteadyHealth  called &#8220;WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD.&#8221; This forum contained individuals&#8217; experiences with these unexplained sensations and inspired cybersecurity company manager Jennifer Allen to try to consolidate and create a name for what people were feeling.   Allen   created the name for this phenomenon and popularized it when she created her 2010 ASMR Facebook group and participated in the ""WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD - PART 2"" thread.   Today, ASMR videos have achieved extreme levels of viewership &#8211; into the millions of views. For example, a video on YouTube that shows the  making of strawberry ice cream rolls    has over 37 million views. ASMR has also infiltrated other internet platforms and can be found on Snapchat in the &#8220;Oddly Satisfying&#8221; channel   and on Spotify as its own genre.  Snapchat's ""Oddly Satisfying"" channel features small snippets of videos intended to stimulate pleasurable responses in their viewers. For example, some of this past weekend's hits featured clay cutting, potato pressing, soap squishing and a surprisingly large assortment of peeling things.  According to Rojas, ASMR videos have also cultivated a type of community through the interactions in the comments section.   ""A lot of the times in my process of going to sleep, I will be not only watching the video, but a thing a lot of people do is go to the comments,"" Rojas said. ""It&#8217;s almost like a weird little community. As you&#8217;re watching this video and falling asleep, you&#8217;re reading the comments.""   The popularity of ASMR, as measured by Google Trends web search for &#8220;ASMR,&#8221; grew steadily from its inception until it reached its peak in February 2019. Though searches for ASMR are no longer on the rise, there   still maintains a steady following. In fact, the account HunniBee ASMR posted a video Friday that received 121,000 views in just three hours.     Additionally, at present, there is not much scientific research on the subject, and most information is collected from individuals&#8217; personal accounts. However, researchers from the Department of Psychology at The University of Sheffield conducted a series of studies attempting to uncover some of the mysteries of ASMR. Among these findings were lower heart rates in participants who self-identified as experiencing ASMR while watching ASMR videos.   Further, an academic clinical neurologist at Yale University's School of Medicine, Steven Novella, proposed some theories for ASMR&#8217;s mechanism in 2012. Specifically, he thought that ASMR could be the result of small pleasurable seizures or could be associated with the brain&#8217;s way of rewarding individuals for increasing their survival probability. He also stated that differences in humans&#8217; brains, or neurodiversity, could explain why some feel a response to certain videos while others do not.  While progress is made on the scientific front, businesses have integrated ASMR into their marketing techniques. For example, major companies like Dove, IKEA, Coca-Cola, KFC and McDonald&#8217;s have created advertisements and campaigns that aim to evoke ASMR in their viewers. IKEA, for one, saw major success after its  ASMR-oriented advertisement  and reported an increase of 5.1% in online sales throughout the duration of the campaign.   However, companies are not the only ones cashing out on the ASMR phenomenon   &#8211; individuals can also profit off ASMR content. The woman behind Gentle Whispering ASMR, one of the ASMR channels with the most subscribers on YouTube, is estimated to make at least $130,000 per year, according to  Business Insider .     ASMR is clearly deserving of attention, if only by virtue of its undeniable popularity.   Moreover, as we gain a better understanding of ASMR, its calming properties may be harnessed in stress management and beyond.  What began as the internet's fascination with watching   someone slice up soap has quickly turned into a global phenomenon, an interesting area of research and maybe even your roommate's not-so-strange hobby.

Researchers from both universities analyzed data of the Filipino, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese and Korean subgroups of the Asian American population. The resulting study, published in the American Journal of Public Health on Feb. 20, found that Asian American subgroups may have disproportionately more health problems and less access to care when compared to non-Hispanic white adults.  These conditions otherwise would be masked when health data is aggregated, according to the study.  Historically, Asian Americans have been branded as a &#8220;model minority&#8221; because of the cultural expectation that a certain minority group will have favorable qualities compared to other subpopulations. This is in spite of evidence that Asians experience healthcare disparities, the study read.  Data disaggregation &#8211; breaking down compiled data into subpopulations &#8211; has been considered as a method to break down the perception of Asian Americans as a ""healthier"" model minority, according to the study.  &#8220;Aggregation shouldn&#8217;t be the standard,&#8221; said Alex Adia, the first author of the study and a researcher from Brown University. &#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be viewed as the default choice.&#8221;  Adia added that the choice to disaggregate should be seen as a choice to properly categorize the sort of outcomes, health conditions and service access people face.  The lack of disaggregated health data disguises the need for intervention and further research into serious health conditions. Such health effects may impact subgroups individually but are not noticeable when this health data is aggregated into a single racial category, the study read.  The researchers analyzed data from the California Health Interview Survey for their report. CHIS is a phone- and web-based survey conducted to examine the health statuses of subpopulations across the state. The survey is carried out by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research alongside the California Department of Public Health and the Department of Health Care Services.  Researchers used CHIS data from 2011 to 2017 to identify health disparities in three categories: health condition, health outcomes and health service access.  Filipino, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese and Korean groups had the most responses to CHIS, which allowed the team to create subgroups for each of these. Other Asian groups were included in CHIS in the general Asian category, but there was not a large enough collection of responses to categorize them into a single subgroup, the study stated.  According to the study, Filipino adults appear to be in the worst health on average compared to the other Asian subgroups.  The most notable disparities among Filipinos when compared to other subgroups are higher rates of obesity or excessive weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and asthma. Among Asian subgroups, they have the highest rates of heart disease, although they did rank lower than non-Hispanic white adults in this category, who have the highest prevalence of this condition.  Despite these differences, Filipino adults reported higher rates of bachelor&#8217;s degrees, insurance coverage and English fluency compared to most other responses in CHIS.  &#8220;The big surprise was that Filipinos, who have socioeconomic advantages in terms of doing well, particularly as immigrants, had the most disparities after disaggregation,&#8221; said Ninez Ponce, a co-author of the study and a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.  Furthermore, Filipinos are overly represented in health care services but face specific factors that influence their disparities, Adia said.  &#8220;Filipino Americans are disproportionately involved in the provision of health care, but it seems the data practices that we currently employed aren't great at identifying their needs,&#8221; Adia said.  While Filipino adults on average are the least-healthy subpopulation, Chinese Californians appear to be the healthiest subgroup with the fewest negative disparities compared with non-Hispanic white adults.  However, Ponce said this does not mean that Chinese adults are necessarily healthier, due in part to the fact that the health outcomes are self-reported.  More study is required to identify how Chinese adults might be more healthy compared to other Asian subpopulations, said Adia, who is currently working on follow-up research.  Each subgroup ranked higher in at least one health disparity compared to other subpopulations, according to the study.  For example, Vietnamese adults had the highest rates of fair or poor health and disability while Korean adults suffered from the highest rates of serious distress. Additionally, Korean adults ranked highest in no usual source of care and delayed care in terms of health service access.  Conversely, Chinese adults ranked highest in the category of no doctors visits in the past year, and the Japanese subgroup topped high blood pressure at the same rate as Filipino adults.  Ponce, who is the principal investigator of CHIS, said she was excited to see this data being used in the United States and around the globe to properly identify the disparities of Asian subgroups.  Ponce added she plans to continue researching these disparities and hopes proper disaggregation can continue for the benefit of subgroups.

The fourth-year economics student co-founded NextBest, an online marketplace for secondhand clothing, with her brother, Hoa Mai. Her idea for this retail platform stemmed from her experience with RefineLA, a social organization she co-founded last year at UCLA that functions like a pop-up thrift store. When she became interested in expanding the club&#8217;s reach, Minh Mai said she thought of moving it online &#8211; an idea that eventually resulted in NextBest, a separate company dedicated to selling secondhand fashion.   &#8220;I was thinking, &#8216;What&#8217;s the perfect solution for college students buying and selling to each other?&#8217; Minh Mai said. &#8220;(With NextBest), they can get rid of clothes they&#8217;re not using but make resale fashion a little easier to buy.&#8221;    [Related:    Students thrift to create sustainable, affordable fashion line inspired by UCLA   ]   NextBest functions as an online marketplace geared towards fashion, where users can buy and sell used clothing items, Minh Mai said. After taking photos of items, sellers post them on NextBest and interested buyers can contact them to arrange a meetup for exchanging the goods. Though the website is open to anybody, Minh Mai said it is particularly focused on the UCLA community because the logistics of handing off clothes depends on close proximity. However, they have temporarily suspended business due to the coronavirus pandemic.   The company&#8217;s focus on a college community makes selling secondhand clothes significantly easier, said Amanda Norman, a fourth-year communications student. Though Norman has used other sites with a similar function, like Poshmark, she said their global scale results in an overwhelming amount of clothing items to sort through. The geographically close community of users on NextBest not only reduces the traffic of items being sold, but also simplifies the process of delivering the clothes, Norman said.   &#8220;With those other apps in my past experience, it can be kind of inconvenient ... to ship whatever item I&#8217;m selling &#8211; with packaging &#8211; and go to the post office,&#8221; Norman said. &#8220;(With NextBest), if you&#8217;re going on campus that day, you can just meet up with someone.&#8221;   On the company&#8217;s end, Minh Mai said the team has been working on streamlining the customer experience. They originally planned to launch version 2.0 of their website during week one of spring quarter, Hoa Mai said, but the COVID-19 pandemic has complicated their entrepreneurial timeline. Instead, they are planning a smaller-scale launch where he said users can stay safe but still experience the new features of version 2.0. Amongst these new features are functions such as filtering items by characteristics like size or category, watching items, commenting on items and messaging among the site&#8217;s users, he said.    [Related:    Online thrifted clothing platform offers affordability, convenience to students   ]    Even further down the line, Minh Mai said the company is working on developing an app that embodies all the new website&#8217;s features &#8211; especially messaging &#8211; with the goal of debuting it in fall quarter. The new addition is intended to increase user engagement, Hoa Mai said, since the majority of their users access NextBest through a mobile device.   &#8220;We believe that one advantage of apps is that people will be reminded to thrift and buy used clothes if they see an app on their home screen,&#8221; Hoa Mai said. &#8220;It also makes notifications a lot more (timely), since you don&#8217;t have to message through a website.&#8221;   NextBest&#8217;s revamped website and eventual app create a secondhand fashion experience that is entirely online. This change in medium affects the process of purchasing secondhand clothes, Minh Mai said, but in a way that merges the benefits of thrifting in-person and online shopping. The cheap prices of clothing items that come with thrifting, combined with the efficient means of online shopping, only expedite the entire process, she said.   &#8220;Online, it&#8217;s easier to sort through what you&#8217;re specifically looking for and all the items available,&#8221; Minh Mai said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s more so you know you want to look for something in particular and try to find it secondhand. It&#8217;s just shopping like any regular online store but you can buy secondhand and you&#8217;re buying the same item at a better price.&#8221;   With long-term goals of expanding to other California college campuses and the possibility of implementing short-distance shipping, NextBest works towards fulfilling its grand mission of implementing ideas that will increase quality of life, Minh Mai said. But for now, she said she hopes that NextBest will gain popularity as a means of buying and selling secondhand fashion.   &#8220;For NextBest, I really want us to become the number one for secondhand fashion,&#8221; Minh Mai said. &#8220;At the end of the day, we want to be the place where you go to make secondhand fashion a lot easier and simpler.&#8221;  ",['cap-vivian-xu'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/dbonlinethrifting.jpg

Since its release in September 2016, the app TikTok has amassed a huge user base, in which a particular subset of mostly preteen and teenage content creators post videos of themselves doing dances to popular songs. Rap is one of the most popular genres these creators turn to, with songs such as K CAMP's ""Lottery (Renegade)"" and Doja Cat's ""Say So"" quickly going viral. But with TikTok's ability to expand an artists fan base and offer promising profitability, many rap artists are wrongfully disregarding the origins and intentions of their genre in an attempt to get money fast.  From its inception, rap music has served as an outlet for marginalized people to individually express themselves and address societys injustices. It thrives off its controversial nature, and many rappers who are popular today continue this tradition and shed light on issues ranging from depression to violence and poverty.   In Juice WRLD's ""Lean Wit Me,"" he discusses his ongoing struggle with drug abuse, and in 2Pac's ""Keep Ya Head Up,"" he brings up issues of feminism and the mistreatment of women in society. However, much like any other art form or industry, there is also a strong desire to make money.   [Related:    Second Take: Cancellations of concerts are upsetting enough, Ticketmaster shouldnt make it worse   ]   Many artists have seen TikTok as a means to both accrue more profit and broaden their fan bases as quickly as possible  as the promotion of their music on the app causes a larger population of users to discover,   purchase and stream their songs. If a song has catchy   and simple lyrics that can be easily translated into dance moves, it has a great chance of becoming successful on the platform.  While TikTok can be a useful tool, if artists invest too much into achieving popularity on the app, they can be received as too corporate or too artificial. With the introduction of a platform that has almost a billion active users, questions arise surrounding the ethics of artists pursuing profitability versus authenticity in their music.  Last week on his  The Brilliant Idiots podcast &nbsp;radio presenter Charlamagne tha God and his co-host discussed these questions and expressed their disappointment with Drakes Toosie Slide, which has recently   gained popularity on TikTok. Charlamagne described the song as whack and beneath Drake, saying that the biggest artists in the world   shouldnt be chasing trends.  While the song is catchy and has a smooth beat, the same cant be said for the simple and overly repetitive lyrics. These clearly feed into the dance craze and pander to audiences on TikTok, serving as a prime example of a song that sells out.""   With one of the original purposes of rap being to push boundaries, the lyrics to Drakes   song   seem juvenile and artificially constructed in comparison, thus leaving a bad taste in the listeners mouth. The song's hook includes basic instructions such as ""right foot up, left foot slide"" and ""left foot up, right foot slide"" repeated many times.      [Related:    Second Take: Quibi bites off more than it can chew in attempt to make streaming more accessible   ]   This is not the first time Drake has had a dance to one of his songs blow-up, however. Before the era of TikTok, dances to both his   Hotline Bling and In My Feelings were made famous   after the songs were   released and had achieved popularity. In these cases, however, the dance was just an accessory to   the song  it didnt comprise its entire identity, as it does   in Toosie Slide.  In this regard, rappers that have TikTok popularity as a mere afterthought in their tracks seem to achieve greater longevity. Many rap songs that have been popular on TikTok recently    including Megan Thee Stallions Savage and Roddy Ricchs The Box""      did not ostensibly set out with the intention of being turned into an online phenomenon. Well-received in the rap and TikTok communities alike, both of these songs continue to push the genre's   boundaries by analyzing the artists' controversial life stories and are undeniably authentic to each respective musician.  But it is not just established artists who have a presence on the platform  many smaller rap artists use TikTok as a means to break into the competitive music industry. This is quite understandable, and if TikTok is the boost they need to start creating art that expresses the most authentic version of themselves, the rap community should be supportive of that. However, artists who are considered legends in the music industry shouldnt actively play into those same trends. With their wealth and status, artists like Drake should consider how they can progress and transform the genre instead of being concerned with keeping up with the trends.  If artists pander exclusively to those who use the platform so overtly, it will create an industry that sacrifices artistry and authenticity for money. Clearly by favoring basic, over-simplified lyrics, an emphasis on creating music solely for TikTok in the rap industry can only be followed by the dilution of the entire genre    reducing the meaning and impact it carries   in order to achieve temporary commercial success.  Trends on TikTok will come and go, but an artists compelling discography and artistry will ultimately speak   for itself.",['cap-natalie-brown'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/tiktok.jpg

""It&#8217;s just a day I&#8217;ll never forget, that lack of clarity, a lot of emotion and not really knowing as a head coach. I had a perfect practice plan in place, and what we were going to do that night in getting ready for (Pac-12 play), and everything kind of got turned upside down,"" Inouye-Perez said.   No. 1 UCLA softball's 2020 season was cut short when the NCAA made the decision to suspend sports for the rest of the school year because of the spread of the novel coronavirus. Forced to end its campaign before it could really begin, the Bruin squad has had to grapple with the questions of what could have been and what the future may hold for a team that was in position to win it all this year.  UCLA was picked as one of the favorites to win the 2020 Women's College World Series coming into the season after having won it all in 2019, and nonconference play gave indications that the Bruins would return to Oklahoma City for a chance to go back-to-back.   After starting the season with 15 straight wins, UCLA rose to the No. 1 spot in the national polls within the first few weeks. The Bruins held an NCAA-best record of 25-1 at the time of the cancellation announcement, which came the night before UCLA was set to  start conference play.  ""When it first happened, me and (senior outfielder) Jacqui Prober were just sitting on the couch, and we heard about all these things getting canceled, and so we were just sitting there waiting for the call. And then we finally heard the news on Twitter, and I think I laughed, because I didn&#8217;t believe it,"" said redshirt junior outfielder Aaliyah Jordan. ""It wasn't until we had our team meeting later, where it really just hit me like, &#8216;Dang, I&#8217;m not going to be able to play this season.'""  In addition to having to cut the season short without a chance at the national championship, UCLA's two players set to graduate, Prober and graduate catcher/utility Jenavee Peres, will now also have to make a hard decision of whether they will be able to take advantage of the extra year of eligibility afforded by the NCAA to spring sport athletes, or move on from the sport as planned.  ""We're still not sure. (Peres) is in grad school, so her plan had been to come back and be able to have that year to play (this season), and (Prober) was planning to graduate, so she's also someone who figuring out what her future is. As far as us wanting both of them back, we do,"" Inouye-Perez said. ""Everyone's in this state of unknown, ... but I just want what's best for the athletes (and) as soon as they're presented with all of the facts, that will allow them to make the best decision for themselves.""   Despite all of the uncertainty still in the air for the Bruins, freshman utility Maya Brady said in the meantime the team is just trying to adjust to the new normal, waiting to get clarity on what the future holds for UCLA softball.   ""It was initially a shock obviously, it didn&#8217;t really hit that the season was truly over until we had a final meeting,"" Brady said. ""Obviously we're devastated, but this is bigger than softball."" ",['cap-coral-smith'],"['softball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.sp_.softball.nbk_.file_.jpg

It wasn't until the NCAA tournament was canceled five days later on March 12 because of the coronavirus pandemic that she realized the next steps in her basketball career were right around the corner, and that she had missed out on one last chance to perform with professional scouts watching.  &#8220;I think (the missed opportunity) is what hurt me the most,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;(It hurt to not be able) to showcase what I can do, what our team can do, because I for sure think (the NCAA tournament) would have made my chances better or put me in a different position.&#8221;  What the future looks like for Dean is unclear because of the global regulations surrounding the COVID-19 crisis as professional sports have been turned on their heads in recent weeks. The WNBA is no exception, with the league postponing both its training camps and its May 15 start to the regular season.  Dean declared for the WNBA draft &#8211; which will still take place remotely April 17 &#8211;   with ESPN's Mechelle Voepel&#8217;s latest mock draft slating Dean to be selected at the beginning of the third round by the Atlanta Dream.  While Dean said she was grateful for any opportunity to play at the next level, she noted that her own draft day expectations are higher.  &#8220;I just want to get drafted honestly, but I am competitive and do think of myself highly, so I think that I can go better than the third round, but whatever happens, happens,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;I'm going to take every opportunity I can and take advantage of it.&#8221;  Luckily for Dean, she has a built-in mentor in former UCLA guard and current player in her third year with the Seattle Storm, Jordin Canada. Canada was drafted as the fifth overall pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft, and she said she has helped Dean prepare for the selection process.  &#8220;I know this is an important time for (Dean), so (I've just been trying) to encourage her and talk to her as much as possible and answer her questions,&#8221; Canada said.   Both Canada and Dean have had to alter their training routines in the wake of new government-mandated restrictions &#8211; but these changes look different for two players at dissimilar points in their careers.   Since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention placed social distancing recommendations into effect, Dean said she has not had access to a basketball gym, but she has lifted weights and has been running to stay in shape. 2018 WNBA champion Canada said she has a workout regiment from the Storm&#8217;s training staff including yoga and pilates.  Canada said the difficulty in getting back to basketball could be furthered if the WNBA season is canceled. She would have a year without basketball as she did not play internationally this past winter, having previously spent the 2018-19 season overseas competing in Poland&#8217;s Basket Liga Kobiet.  Despite the uncertainty, however, Canada &#8211; who was named to the All-Defensive First Team and led the WNBA in steals in 2019 &#8211; said she was confident that her defensive abilities will remain strong while social distancing recommendations prohibit her from practicing with other players.   &#8220;I'm not worried at all,&#8221; Canada said. &#8220;I'm sure everyone will be a little bit rusty, but I think once you get back into the swing of things, things will be just fine.&#8221;   Dean said she has been advised by coach Cori Close through the unique challenges caused by the novel coronavirus.  Close said the departing point guard changed the program&#8217;s culture and said she understood the potential hit to Dean's future prospects as her final collegiate season was shortened.   ""I couldn't be any more proud of (Dean) because she has the most to lose here,&#8221; Close said.  Dean said she still plans to pursue a career overseas like Canada &#8211; a common practice by WNBA players to increase their earnings &#8211; regardless of the status of the WNBA&#8217;s 2020 season.

Zunyou Wu, an adjunct professor of epidemiology in the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was among the first scientists to study SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, when it first surfaced in Wuhan, China, in late December.  Wu assessed the movement and behavior of the virus, and made predictions about its spread after joining the response team. Wu also acted as a liaison for China when the World Health Organization visited the country during the epidemic.  The virus started spreading outside of China in December, according to WHO. Since then, there have been more than five million confirmed cases and 300,000 deaths due to COVID-19.  Although the news of the coronavirus was frightening to many, Wu said he was composed because of his experience working with viruses. In 2003, Wu advised China&#8217;s response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, which was also caused by a coronavirus.  Roger Detels, an epidemiology research professor at the School of Public Health and Wu&#8217;s past professor, said Wu was one of the key individuals who developed and implemented China&#8217;s response to the epidemic.  Wu and his colleagues on the coronavirus response team sequenced the virus&#8217; genetic structure by early January, allowing a diagnostic test to be developed weeks after China first identified the COVID-19 virus.  &#8220;That&#8217;s got to be the most rapid response on record to any unknown infectious disease,&#8221; Detels said. &#8220;(Wu has) played quite an important role in infectious diseases in China.&#8221;  Although China has managed to control the spread of the virus and has started reopening, Wu said he is still worried about COVID-19&#8217;s persistence in developed countries such as the United States.  Along with his response team, Wu began to host international video conferences with response teams from other countries to share their experiences and findings.  &#8220;The future is uncertain globally, but we do our best to control the epidemic in China and share our experience with other countries,&#8221; Wu said.  Wu hypothesized that COVID-19 would pan out in one of four possible scenarios.  COVID-19 might mimic the trajectory of SARS and become quickly controlled, or it could behave like a seasonal virus, such as the flu. It could, thirdly, also be a combination of the first two scenarios. COVID-19 might also persist until people have herd immunity or a vaccine, he said.  Although Wu has been deeply involved with the coronavirus efforts, he said his specialty lies in another type of virus &#8211; human immunodeficiency virus.  Wu, the Chinese CDC&#8217;s former director of HIV Prevention of the National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, has contributed to significant progress in HIV testing and treatment strategies.  He launched a nationwide HIV testing campaign in 2004 to increase Chinese people&#8217;s access to diagnostic testing and proper treatment.  &#8220;We changed society&#8217;s attitude (toward) HIV-infected individuals, particularly for people living with HIV themselves,&#8221; Wu said. &#8220;Once they (were) diagnosed as positive, they had antiretroviral therapy (and) they had hope for living, ... stigma was significantly reduced ... and slowly other countries gradually accepted the concept for testing.&#8221;  Jennifer McGoogan, an independent consultant, worked with Wu on his HIV and COVID-19 research. She said she commended Wu for his motivation to protect and ensure the health of Chinese people during various epidemics.  &#8220;Wu is just such a champion for the sick and the forgotten and the discriminated against,&#8221; she said.  Before Wu had become prominent in the public health sphere, he grew up in one of China&#8217;s least developed provinces, Anhui. He was born during the Cultural Revolution and credits the historical event for his education, he said.  &#8220;At the time, some high school graduates became teachers in the rural remote areas, so we actually benefited from (their education),&#8221; Wu said.  Wu went on to attend medical university to study public health and epidemiology before moving to the U.S. and pursuing a doctorate degree at UCLA. Virginia Li, a professor emerita of community health services at the School of Public Health, and Detels were presented with two candidates by the Chinese Ministry of Health for a scholarship program, ultimately choosing Wu to participate.  &#8220;I looked at the CVs, one is more laboratory orientated and the other was more public health orientated,&#8221; Li said. &#8220;Together, Dr. Detels and I selected (Wu), and that&#8217;s how he came to the United States and studied under Dr. Detels.&#8221;  Detels said he was proud of Wu&#8217;s development and professional journey. The pair have collaborated on numerous projects, transforming their once student-teacher relationship to that of colleagues, Detels said.  &#8220;Since (Wu) was my student, I&#8217;m very proud of him,&#8221; Detels said. &#8220;He&#8217;s obviously very intelligent, but ... brilliance is not enough to have an impact. You have to put it into action. He is very much a doer.&#8221; ",['cap-phoebe-chen'],"['news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.news_.coronavirusperson.jpg

Thats equivalent to the lofty challenge students at UCLA face when they arrive for New Student Orientation.  Add being a first-generation student to the mix, and the challenge becomes even more disorienting.  UCLA hosts 11 New Student Orientation sessions each summer, three of which hold spots specifically for international and out-of-state students. Transfer students can choose from a set of nine one-day transfer orientation dates or register for the longer three-day NSO recommended for first-year students.  NSO is organized by the New Student &amp; Transition Programs office and run by student employees called New Student Advisors. The NSA cohort is trained throughout the spring quarter prior to the summer of their employment.  While NSA cohorts are often applauded for their diversity, the program lacks a full-time staff member dedicated to the experience of first-generation students, thereby shortchanging a major population that needs extra assistance transitioning to UCLA. UCLA media relations did not respond to request for comment on this issue.  First-generation college students need a separate NSO in which they can learn to navigate the complexities of college in an environment specifically catered to their experience. Attending NSO is highly encouraged by the university, and students who fail to pay the $445 to attend are instructed to contact the New Student &amp; Transition Programs office before enrolling for their first quarters at UCLA. But whether it's a phone call or an in-person orientation, both options currently fail to create an immersive experience for first-generation students going through a potentially rocky transition.  Nearly one-third of UCLA undergraduates are first-generation college students, and we deserve that representation in our first introduction to higher education.  The point of NSO is to be an extensive introduction to the academic and campus life at UCLA, and given that first-generation students are statistically less likely to graduate on time, they need specific resources to get off on the right foot.  This lack of understanding isnt just missing in the administration but in the education of advisors themselves.  Kesia Eng, a fourth-year political science student, summer 2019 NSA and one of the founders of the Association of First-Generation Undergraduates at UCLA, said that while there isnt a specific orientation for first-generation students, students can be aided through the Academic Advancement Program's bridge programs and the First to Go office.  During the training (as an NSA), I would say we are very mindful and inclusive of all the different identities and groups that come onto our campus, Eng said. So while there isn't specifically, Oh, this is a first-gen student and this is what you should say to a first-gen student, that is something we always keep in mind during our training.  Despite Engs personal experience with her cohort, some first-generation students face the reality that advisors who arent first-generation students themselves seem unprepared to deal with their questions.  Or in some cases, unwilling.  Vanessa Newman, a third-year public affairs student, said she felt a lack of access to and care in both transfer-student and first-generation student programs on campus. Newman said she paid more money to arrive at her NSO a day early, but the experience was still not a positive one.  My New Student Advisor was not familiar with being a transfer student or being first generation, Newman said. Everyone was a transfer student in my group, and they also were feeling judged by our NSA  she didnt answer questions or she would give us sarcastic replies if we were confused about something.  When individuals who are paid to welcome students to campus turn a cold shoulder to first-generation students, it only further perpetuates feelings of isolation upon entering UCLA's campus.  And given that NSA cohorts have hours of training each week and must pass bi-weekly exams with a 90% or higher, according to Eng, this is not an issue of lack of time or training.  But with the right outreach, not all experiences are negative.  David Deng, a first-year computer science student who is not first generation, said he attended an orientation with reserved spots for international students and found his NSA particularly helpful.  I especially like how they had someone who was in your major to help you, and even though I dont see my orientation friends a ton, the experience made me feel like I belonged at the school, Deng said. We had a few international students in our group and it was really interesting how even though we grew up in different countries and had different experiences, there was still a lot that we all had in common.  These beneficial experiences are predicated on time being set aside for international and out-of-state students  and they seem to work. But considering these populations make up 8% and 16% of freshmen admits, respectively, it is a major oversight not to create a similarly specialized program for the large first-generation population at UCLA.  While some may argue that having separate orientations for first-generation students would only further ostracize them, UCLA needs to acknowledge this divide already exists. If having separate orientations were truly isolating, out-of-state and international students would not be walking away with positive experiences and relationships.  First-generation college students deserve a safe space to question, learn and grow before entering a new community.  By the end of a specialized orientation, first-generation college students will be able to do a lot more than just navigate Boelter.  Theyll be able to excel alongside their peers.",['cap-rachel-durose'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.op_.idektheslug.file_.jpg

Shruti Parekh, a graduate student  at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, said her film   centers around three protagonists who intend to illegally cross the border into Canada in the middle of the night, hoping to start a new life. Now in the editing phase of postproduction, she said the short film will be finalized by end of May or early June  , just in time for an end-of-the-year showcase. Parekh said she hopes to deliver a suspenseful drama by detailing not only the connection immigrants have with each other but also their opposing views of the United States.  ""The reason so many people are crossing into Canada is because you can claim asylum,"" Parekh said. ""You&#8217;re not guaranteed to get it, but you can stay in Canada until you find out, and they usually treat you better.""    [Related:    Student film reflects on friendship, love and loss in story of owner and pet   ]   Parekh's inspiration for creating &#8220;Esperanza&#8221; was based on   interviewing immigrants while working for a digital media organization   that focuses on immigration efforts, where she often covered the illegal border crossings into Canada. Hearing the stories of people fleeing the United States sparked her interest in developing a film capable of encapsulating the crossing and the various sentiments immigrants had about leaving the U.S., she said.  The three fictional immigrants are Dev, Estrella and Marisol. Dev, an Indian immigrant and taxi driver, has been attempting to scrounge enough money in the U.S. so that he can bring the rest of his family from India to the U.S. for a better life. Parekh said Dev's character is an example of an immigrant who truly believes in the American Dream but has been hardened by a lack of results.  [caption caption=""Parekh was inspired to create &#8220;Esperanza&#8221; after interviewing immigrants while working for a digital media organization that focuses on immigration efforts. Speaking with many people who illegally crossed the border into Canada sparked her interest in exploring people&#8217;s varying perspectives on living in America, she said. (Sakshi Joglekar/Daily Bruin)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_376914"" width=""672""]   [/caption]   However, contrasting Dev and his more common immigrant experience are Estrella and Marisol, a Salvadorian lesbian couple, who are fleeing the U.S. to start a family in Canada. The two came to the U.S. under temporary protected status 15 years prior to when the film takes place  , but that has since expired, leaving them unable to find steady jobs. Their differing opinions on whether or not to illegally cross into Canada drive most of the film's conflict, but Parekh said it's when the two hop into Dev's taxi that the story really begins as they connect to each other over their immigrant experiences.  As the audience follows the three protagonists, Parekh said the film's tension is mostly derived from its setting, which takes place almost entirely at night. Graduate student   Ingrid Sanchez, the film's cinematographer, said shooting at night allowed the tone of the film to feel more anxious and uncertain since the darkness created an environment where the characters felt isolated.      &#8220;Everything is shot at night, aside from one scene at dawn that gives the most hopeful moment of the film,&#8221; Sanchez said. &#8220;Everything else played at night provides this more moody quality and adds to this idea of fear and being unsure of what the future holds.&#8221;   [Related:    Film explores Chinese culture, generation gap between immigrant parents and kids   ]   While the film's   timing and lighting provide a subtle undertone of unease and bolster the narrative, producer Laura Scarano said it was not without its challenges.   She said   reserving sets and obtaining the required nighttime permits were particularly challenging as many places do not want to stay open after business hours, which increased the price of shooting.   &#8220;Filming in certain neighborhoods at night requires you to have to ask all the nearby residents if it&#8217;s alright to film there,"" Scarano said. ""They usually charge extra, which isn&#8217;t great when you&#8217;re on a limited budget.&#8221;  Despite the funding concerns and the technicalities of shooting, Scarano said she hopes by June, audiences will be able to understand that immigration isn't just a black-and-white issue. The people who are immigrating or emigrating to or from the U.S. can't be boxed in by stereotypes, she said. Parekh wants ""Esperanza"" to embody the dynamics of different immigrants and their viewpoints, and she hopes the suspenseful realism of the script and camerawork will help their stories come alive.  &#8220;&#8216;Esperanza' is about immigrants in the U.S., but it&#8217;s also about their differences and how they are put at odds with one another because of a larger situation,&#8221; Parekh said. &#8220;This is a meditation on a system that forces people to make decisions that hurt each other; it&#8217;s about the consequences of choices we can make as an individual.""

UCLA&#8217;s Campus Events Commission invited Antoni Porowski, known for his role in the Netflix series &#8220;Queer Eye,&#8221; to lead an online cookalong of his easy spaghetti recipe open to UCLA students. Porowski also answered questions throughout the cookalong about his experiences in college and more recently during the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Queer Eye"" stars five men who use their expertise in different sectors of lifestyle and beauty to help improve the lifestyles of the person or people featured in each episode. On the show, Porowski, a self-taught cook, uses his cooking knowledge to promote healthy eating.  On the cookalong, hosted over the videoconferencing tool Zoom, Porowski said he used frozen peas as an inexpensive source of protein while he was in college. He also said Trader Joe&#8217;s canned tuna in oil was a cheap and healthy meal option for him.  He added that frozen dinners do not give him energy, and encouraged students to use fresh produce in their meals.  Porowski said he changed his major multiple times while in college. He told students as long as they were involved in something, there would be a path for them to pursue after school.  He also talked about the effects of quarantine on his mental health. Porowski said there is a tricky balance between overwhelming oneself with the news and staying educated on current events.  The event was one of CEC&#8217;s biggest audience engagements on social media, said Tara Steinmetz, the Campus Events commissioner and a fourth-year French language and literature and global studies student. On its Facebook, for example, more than 800 people expressed interest in attending the event, she said.   The number of attendees in the event peaked at around 280 people, said Sage LaCroix, the CEC speakers director and one of the moderators of the event.  The Zoom room only had space for 500 people, but since many people entered and exited the Zoom call, there was enough room for everyone who was interested to join the event, LaCroix said.  The CEC had considered bringing Porowski to UCLA for a while but hadn&#8217;t because of his expensive booking rates. Porowski&#8217;s rates during quarantine were significantly lower, which allowed them to organize the event, LaCroix said.  Before the event began, CEC gave away 10 Visa gift cards to roughly subsidize students for the costs of the ingredients needed to cook Porowski&#8217;s dish.  CEC typically aims to attract about 300 people to campus events, so being able to achieve a similar number on Zoom is a great achievement, Steinmetz said.  Many students enjoyed the opportunity to cook with one of their favorite stars and listen to Porowski&#8217;s advice and personal experiences on a range of topics including living healthy, college lifestyle tips and more.  &#8220;In a confusing time like the present where internships are getting canceled and there is mass uncertainty, it was a nice event to look forward to,&#8221; said Sasha Nijor, a third-year communication student who attended the event.  Bella Stenvall, a third-year dance and Arabic student, cooked along with Porowski at her home and shared the excitement of seeing Porowski onscreen with her family.  Porowski&#8217;s insight into how the news can affect people&#8217;s mental health was especially relatable, said Ryan Tran, a first-year linguistics and computer science student.  &#8220;I want to be informed about what's going on but that's also a rabbit hole I go down and get anxious about,&#8221; Tran said.  Although the event was hosted virtually, knowing that many other people were also watching the event made it seem like an in-person communal experience, Tran said.  The event stood out to Nijor because of how relaxed and intimate it was.  &#8220;Even though he is a celebrity and you would expect him to have intense lighting or high production value, he was just in his kitchen,&#8221; Nijor said.

Every week, Daily Bruin staffers will analyze some of the most significant stories to keep readers up to speed.   With the seventh week of remote learning now behind us, UCLA students and faculty are not only preparing for finals but   also are trying to determine what the future of online learning will look like. From changes to admission requirements to summer session C adjustments, The Quad is reviewing some of this week's most newsworthy events and changes.   Napolitano recommends suspending SAT, ACT as admissions criteria until at least 2024   In a proposal released Monday, University of California President Janet Napolitano advised   the suspension of the SAT and ACT   as admissions requirements until 2024.    These standardized tests will remain optional in the admissions process through 2022, but will be eliminated by 2024. In the meantime, the UC plans to develop a test that better reflects its values.  The UC Board of Regents is set to vote on Napolitano's recent proposal May 21. However, it is hard to tell what will happen, given that past efforts to completely suspend the use of standardized testing in admissions have been voted down.  For now, it has been  officially decided  that students applying for fall quarter will not be required to submit their SAT or ACT scores as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.   UCLA to hold summer session C online, considering selective in-person instruction   University officials announced Monday that summer session C  set to start Aug. 3 and end Sept. 11  will be held online as a result of COVID-19.  In an email to students, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Emily Carter and Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Patricia Turner said that UCLA is still considering offering some programs in-person.  However, per the email,   students should expect to receive instruction online unless otherwise stated by their department.   Guerrero to take over as USIUSF president after retiring as UCLA Athletics director   It was announced May 7 that UCLA Athletics Director Dan Guerrero was elected president of the U.S. International University Sports Federation.  Guerrero's term will begin July 1 and will last through 2024. Guerrero was set to retire June 30 after 18 years in his position as UCLA Athletics director.  Guerrero has experience in USIUSF not only as a previous vice president, but also as an athlete who competed in past USIUSF tournaments.  The athletics director brought the Bruins 32 NCAA championships from 15 different sports in his 18 years at UCLA. Guerrero has also been named NACDA Under Armour Athletic Director of the Year three times.   UCLAs first ballet company a safe haven for plis, dgags and fun   The Ballet Company at UCLA, founded by Ada Chung, Ying Xuan Chua and Moe Kawakami, has been holding   intermediate-level ballet workshops over Zoom this   quarter. The three founders hope to foster an inclusive and supportive environment for dancers of all skill levels in their online workshops, Kawakami said.    The company's aim is to hold workshops that best connect dancers with their bodies and allow for dancers to complete exercises with flexibility, Chua said.  Even though workshops have been held virtually, attendance has been heartwarming, Chua said. Additionally, according to Chung, the Ballet Company at UCLA has managed to build a strong community.  In the future, and upon returning to campus, the Ballet Company at UCLA aims to host more workshops throughout the year and showcase its work in a recital every spring.   USAC election voter turnout increases with referendums on ballot, online format   The voter turnout at this years Undergraduate Students Association Council election saw an increase from 16.18% last year to 30.06% this year.  In addition to this increase in voter turnout, the number of competing candidates also spiked from 16 to 30 for 15 positions.  USA Elections Board Chair Navi Sidhu said in the article that the presence of referendums on this years ballot is likely to have increased voter turnout. Additionally, the election board gave out $15,000 worth of gift cards to students who voted in an effort to increase engagement.  A 30% voter turnout is a good place to start, according to incoming USAC President Naomi Riley.   However, Riley also said the voter turnout displayed the need for USAC to focus on   its   accessibility and transparency to students.     Yet, with the election process conducted online as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, USAC faced newfound technological challenges. Not only were there more sanctions related to campaign violations, but also candidates faced increased online hate speech.  Riley said that she encountered overt discrimination and harassment online. But, Riley said her campaign managed to step away from the online toxicity, and her council sworn into office Tuesday.",['cap-kimia-azad'],"['campus-quad', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/weeklyreview.jpg

Welcome back, Inouye-Perez said.  Both redshirt senior pitcher/first baseman Rachel Garcia and senior utility Bubba Nickles will rejoin UCLA softball for the 2021 season.  Originally, Garcia and Nickles were going to sit out all of the 2020 softball season in order to train for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and then rejoin UCLA in 2021, but with the coronavirus pandemic pushing the Olympics back a year, the same plan would force the players to sit out two seasons of college softball in order to train.  Inouye-Perez  who was in contact with the United States coach Ken Eriksen throughout the process  advocated for a change of plans.  To take two years off of school is difficult for anyone  allowing them to get their degree and to continue to train will put them in position to be at their best, Inouye-Perez said. (Eriksen) was very open to finding a way to support these collegiate athletes and make sure they have the most successful path in this strange time.  Under the new plan, the players will represent both UCLA and Team USA in 2021.  This is a great opportunity to just grow and learn and train for the Olympics, so I'm looking at it as all positive even though the Olympics are postponed another year, Garcia said. ""It's just super exciting to be able to represent both teams and go out this last year with a bang.  Nickles and Garcia had been training with Team USA over the past few months, including the Stand Beside Her pre-Olympic tour that matched them up against college teams across the nation  including UCLA.  Although Team USA only played a fraction of the scheduled tune-up scrimmages and training camps before they were canceled, Nickles said she picked up habits that will prepare her for the upcoming season  both with UCLA and Team USA.  One of the biggest things that I picked up from (team USA) was just how disciplined the players were with their own routines and how consistent they were, Nickles said. I saw that and thought, That's a good idea, I should probably do that to mentally prepare for practices and games.""  While the two players will officially be Bruins once again in 2021, it will be in a limited fashion.  Team USA will hold periodic training camps that will accompany scrimmages. The two players will attend these training camps and scrimmages when necessary, which will potentially force them to miss UCLA practices and even games.  Both Garcia and Nickles said they acknowledged the challenge in this, but Inouye-Perez said she has no doubts that the two players will succeed.  ""(Nickles) and (Garcia) are just already elite  they are Olympians because they represent the best of the best and the top one percent,"" Inouye-Perez said. ""We are proud that they are Olympians, and they will be gone for some training events and some potential competition during the collegiate season, and we have no problem with that.""  Even without Garcia and Nickles this past season, the Bruins finished as the No. 1 ranked team in the country with a 25-1 record heading into conference play.  Garcia  the 2019 NFCA National Pitcher of the Year  will be rejoining a pitching staff that includes the 2020 Softball America Pitcher of the Year in sophomore Megan Faraimo and freshman Lexi Sosa, who pitched a perfect game in her final start of the season.  UCLA was set to only lose two players from this years roster, but as a result of the NCAAs decision to grant an extra year of eligibility to student-athletes in spring sports, they may not lose any.  Inouye-Perez said the big rosters experience will only help lead them where they want to go with the return of Garcia and Nickles.  We'll be a large roster, but we'll be very experienced, Inouye-Perez said. The program is really focused on what is best for the team, and (Garcia) and (Nickles) are truly able to say they are best for this team.",['cap-jon-christon'],"['softball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/df79f94f-c2e8-411b-8a9e-b5b115688b60-1.jpg

I wrote my first song when I was in seventh grade and I had EJ sing it, Cam Chen said. It was this super cheesy love song called Nothing More and EJ was in fourth grade. We literally created an album for it.  EJ Chen said this first album, which the brothers sold to Cam Chen's middle school friends, was when he began to gain confidence in singing and performing. It showed that there was an audience willing to   pay to listen to him sing, he said.  Even as their teamwork grew,   the pair continued to develop separate processes for making their own music as they grew up. While Cam Chen was classically trained in music, EJ Chen said he was self-trained to play   by ear. These stylistic differences meant there was no set formula for the duo's   teamwork, resulting in music which was often spontaneous and unplanned.  Individually, Im a very heavy-on-lyrics guy. ... Ill write poetry when Im in my feels ... that I could turn into a song if I wanted to, EJ Chen said. ""Sometimes when Cam is playing ... I look at my notes and Ill see if the melody can fit with the words.  Unlike   EJ Chens lyrics-first approach,   Cam Chen said he is more formulaic in his song making. Instead of implementing pre-made words into a song, he said he would actively sit at a piano and experiment with lyrics and chords simultaneously.  Despite having a different writing   style than his brother's, Cam Chen said he ultimately envisions EJ Chen as the singer for his songs. This influences the style and tone of the music he makes so   that every song is capable of synthesizing with EJ Chens voice. The brothers said the interplay and synergy between their different processes allow for frequent impromptu collaboration sessions.  A lot of times ... Im sitting at the piano and EJ will just ask or talk about a certain style, Cam Chen said. Then Ill just play different chord progressions and ... really be messing around, and EJ will start riffing   and using some of his lines hed created before ... and well just jam.""  The duo's teamwork was temporarily curtailed by Cam Chens departure for college. Even apart, the two continued to support each others music, as they would send each other new songs theyd made or melodies theyd like. Their reunion at UCLA this last year allowed them to start crafting original songs together again; they used one of these songs, a piece called ""Apart,"" to audition for Spring Sing. EJ Chen said this song has a stylistic approach with pop influences from Lauv and James Bay, and the duo will perform the same song in the event.  Now that Spring Sing is going virtual, the pair has started producing a music video for their song, which Joseph   Cho, a third-year political science student, is helping with. Cho said his production work, which involves mixing and transitioning between verse and chorus, helps cohesively blend the song together.  The palette of making the song ... brings out that emotional feeling,"" Cho said. ""Beautiful keys are layered around the song which are the foundation for the whole melody. It's an intimate sound, and I think it definitely ... would resonate with a lot of people.  While the original performance would have been more acoustic and soft, the brothers said the online aspect of Spring Sing 2020 has allowed them to add more production value to the recorded song, especially with new added vocal harmonies from EJ Chen and instrumental additions from Cam Chen.  Even with the added production value, the brothers said their song will retain its pop influences and piano base. The production allowed the song to feel more uplifting, more blended   and more textured, but at its heart the authenticity and emotion of their post-love song   persists, the brothers said.  With this being the first performance at Spring Sing for the duo, EJ Chen said that he and Cam Chen are excited and prepared for the opportunity. Even as their audience grew from their   middle school friends to Spring Sing's many viewers, he said the core and creation of their performance remains rooted in their complementary collaboration.  (Our music is)   us being at the same place at the same time and having time on our hands to craft, Cam Chen said. Thats the main thing for us, just being together.",['cap-daniel-lin'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Ejandcamchen-1.jpg

And if it&#8217;s possible to keep future goals in focus, extra time can be a good thing, according to some of the current and former UCLA student athletes who had been preparing for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They agreed they could use all the time they can get.  When UCLA women's soccer senior goalkeeper Teagan Micah found out the Olympics had been postponed and rescheduled, she said her shock was quickly replaced by contentment.  &#8220;I was obviously taken back from it, however, in the grand scheme of things I was relieved,&#8221; Micah said. &#8220;It has been a great opportunity to reset. Individually, I have taken this time to recover from a few little injuries that I had been carrying with me from playing in back-to-back seasons.&#8221;  After finishing her final season with the Bruins in December, Micah began training with the Australian national women&#8217;s soccer team in preparation for what would have been her first Olympics.  For Micah and other first-time Olympians, the postponement has offered a much-needed opportunity to prepare more fully for the world stage.   Former UCLA beach volleyball player Sarah Sponcil had spent all her time since last year&#8217;s national championship May 5 training with partner Kelly Claes to earn a spot on Team USA. They are currently the third-ranked pair in the U.S. and would have had until June 15 to move into the top-two teams in order to qualify for the Olympics.  Sponcil said since she and Claes are just beginning their professional careers and are in no rush to compete right away, they are grateful for the extra time to improve their standing.  &#8220;The more time that we have, the better for us &#8211; the more time we have to train, to get more experience,&#8221; Sponcil said. &#8220;I think for a lot of other athletes it&#8217;s hitting differently, especially older ones. But for us, we&#8217;re so young. So it was a shock, but it was a good thing.&#8221;  Sponcil has taken advantage of the downtime to not only focus on her athletic development, but also to build her brand as a professional beach volleyball player.  She has recently launched a  website  that features blog posts and at-home workout routines, and said she plans to try her hand at a YouTube channel designed to support young beach volleyball players.   &#8220;A goal of mine is always to be known as a relatable person and not just as this athlete who can do X, Y, Z or has won this many tournaments,&#8221; Sponcil said. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy and more fulfilled in life when I&#8217;m looked up to as that role model for these girls that I once was.&#8221;  Sponcil may be one of the youngest beach athletes who was headed for Tokyo, but UCLA softball redshirt senior pitcher/first baseman Rachel Garcia and senior utility Bubba Nickles &#8211; two members of USA Softball &#8211; aren&#8217;t even officially professionals yet, as they still have remaining college eligibility.  Garcia said in addition to the gift of extra preparation, her time in quarantine has allowed her to get to know her USA teammates more intimately off the field.  &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a bonding experience, especially with our team since we figured out another way to be in contact other than just through texts &#8211; we do talks every Tuesday,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;That&#8217;s been a big factor through this quarantine that&#8217;s bringing us closer, to help us get to know each other better on a personal level.&#8221;  The duo also plans to start joining the current Bruins&#8217; Zoom meetings in the coming weeks, though neither has decided whether she will return to UCLA for a final season after the Olympics.  Even with so much up in the air, Nickles said the anticipation surrounding the return of sports makes the future Olympics even more exciting.  &#8220;This is the first time that the Olympics &#8211; and then every type of sporting event &#8211; has been abruptly stopped, so it&#8217;s kind of sad and disappointing that it happened, but it makes it so much sweeter when it does come back around,&#8221; Nickles said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the coolest part about it, is that people are just eagerly waiting for the best parts of everything to come back.&#8221;  It&#8217;s still uncertain how long it will take for sports to come back. But when they do, it will be as historic as the day they were taken away.

From medical-grade to DIY, masks have been put in high demand because of the COVID-19 health crisis  and it's important to know what's what. We're discussing face masks, from their popularity in past decades to their current role in stopping the spread of coronavirus.  First things first,   there are a couple of things to get straight. Some masks do more than others, and some types  such as surgical masks and the N95  are classified as personal protective equipment, or PPE. These types of masks are characterized by their ability to provide the most effective barriers to block the spread of infection.   As a result, these masks are important for health care workers fighting the pandemic on the front lines, and officials have warned the public not to hoard them in order to prioritize their own health.  Even these PPE masks, however, are not able to eliminate the possibility of the virus entering one's system. N95 masks, for example, filter about 95% of particles that are at least 0.3 microns in size. The problem is that the COVID-19 virus can range from 0.06 to 0.12 microns, UCLA bioengineering professor Benjamin Wu said in a live presentation to alumni engineers.  ""The coronavirus is not in the high collection efficiency range (of the N95),"" Wu said in the presentation. ""That size range is actually very difficult for some filters to make. So, as we make our own filter materials, we actually have to make sure that we are capturing that size discrepancy.""  Wu and his team decided there was more to be done and set out to make an even more efficient type of mask. The team tested various filtering materials with machines to control particle size and effectively test filtration to improve on existing mask designs for COVID-19 filtering.  They designed six new prototypes of the  Powered Air Purifying Respirator  machines, a mask-helmet that can cover the head and provide respiratory protection. The devices are durable, battery-powered and protect against 99.7% of particles measuring at or above 0.3 microns in size.  The team also worked to improve face shields and are looking into scaling up for manufacturing. In addition, the face-shield design has been approved for 3D printing distribution.  Though these PPE masks and professional devices like the PAPR will most likely be allotted to health care workers first and foremost, there are face mask options we can turn to for everyday use.  [caption id=""attachment_380238"" align=""alignleft"" width=""640""]  Cloth masks can help prevent people from transmitting a virus through their respiratory droplets. (Daanish Bhatti/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  For example,   cloth masks do not have the ability to filter out small particles, but according to  Healthline , they can still help to stop the spread of a virus at the community level. Cloth masks   covering the nose and mouth can prevent people from transmitting a virus via respiratory droplets, and they're officially  recommended  by the CDC.  Luckily, cloth masks are generally obtainable and the CDC offers  instructions  to make them in a handful of ways depending on what materials you have on hand. For those not interested in making a mask,   you can purchase them online  for example, handmade e-commerce site Etsy has blown up with masks for sale; the site even revealed that from April 4 to April 6, users searched for masks for 9 times per second on average, summing to a grand total of 9 million searches in a span of 3 days .   [ICYMI:    Alumna brightens up pandemic with affordable, colorful masks ]      As we see more people complying with official recommendations to wear masks, it's interesting to note that 2020 is not the first time that they've been widely used. In fact, in some parts of the world, non-PPE masks have been a common garment for decades.  According to  Quartz , wearing a mask became common in Japan during the 1918 flu pandemic. It became common to cover ones face with some sort of cloth, scarf or shawl as a precaution to safeguard against the virus.  This mask habit persisted post-World War II, as Japan recovered from the war and more industrialization led to greater pollution. Worsening air quality compelled citizens to wear masks for respiratory health. Comparatively, neighboring countries such as Korea and China experienced similar trends in mask-wearing.  In addition,   non-PPE fabric masks have been studied as a nonverbal way to signal social isolation.  Japanese psychologists  have theorized that young Japanese people may wear masks and headphones to show a lack of desire to socialize.    Somewhere along the way, masks transitioned to more than just a health precaution. For some people, they have become a fashion statement as well.  In 2014, a  Chinese fashion designer  created a smog couture line of clothing, referencing the countrys pollution problems. The fashion line included a set of masks with Darth Vader-esque ventilators and riot gear face shields. More recently, pop star  Billie Eilish sported a Gucci face mask to the 2020 Grammys .  Interestingly, members of the fashion industry have also taken an interest in masks in order to educate.  Fashion designers are using social media to teach the public how to make masks in order to alleviate the shortage of pre-made ones. Lia Kes of sustainable clothing brand Kes began selling up-cycled silk and cotton masks on her website and donates a face mask to a health care worker for each mask purchased.  Whether you wore them before the pandemic, or masks are a whole new thing for you, experts are  reminding  folks to treat masks the way they would treat their own clothes. Masks should be washed in warm water with soap and dried overnight to stay clean. Continual use of masks can cause chafing, irritation and acne breakouts, so it's also important to have a regular skin-cleansing routine as well.  Whatever kind of mask you're wearing, the reality is that it seems we're all going to be wearing them for quite a bit longer. For health care providers, masks are an essential way to stay healthy on the job; for Billie Eilish, a Gucci mask may function as both a fashion accessory and protective gear.  Our face coverings may not be PPE-grade or designer, but the important thing is that everyone does their best to stop the spread in whatever ways we can.",['cap-passa-pungchai'],"['campus-quad', 'student-life', 'quad', 'westwood-quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.quad_.maskculture.B.DB_.jpg

No. 6 UCLA baseball (11-1) lost to UC Santa Barbara (10-2) 8-5 on Tuesday at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for its first defeat of the season. The previously undefeated Bruins had not given up more than two runs in any game before Tuesday, but gave up six runs in the Gauchos&#8217; last four offensive innings &#8211; including four in the bottom of the fifth.  The Gauchos jumped out to the early lead, scoring a run in the bottom of the first inning against the Bruins&#8217; starter freshman Jared Karros. The righty was able to put up a zero in the second before UCLA came back to tie the game in the third inning with an RBI single to left center from redshirt junior designated hitter Jarron Silva.  The Bruins were able to draw even with the Gauchos twice Tuesday night, but it wasn't enough.  After UCLA tied the game in the third, UCSB came right back with a run of its own to retake the lead in the bottom half of the inning.  This time, the home squad's lead didn't last through the next inning, as the Bruins plated two in the top of the fourth, thanks to a run-scoring error off the bat of senior left fielder Kyle Cuellar and an RBI single by junior infielder RJ Teijeiro.  The Bruins extended their lead to two runs in the top of the fifth inning when sophomore catcher Noah Cardenas doubled in a run with two outs in the frame, bringing the score to 4-2 after four and a half innings.  But UCLA's two-run advantage didn't stand long either. And after the fifth inning, there would be no catching up.  In the bottom of the fifth, Karros walked the leadoff man and was pulled in favor of junior right-hander Adrian Chaidez.  The righty in relief gave up a walk and a single before getting a strikeout for the first out of the inning.  Next out of the bullpen was freshman left-hander Jake Saum, who walked the only Gaucho he faced, narrowing the advantage to one run.  UCLA was able to get an out before allowing another run and held onto the lead with two outs and the bases loaded. Sophomore left-hander Daniel Colwell was called on and issued a walk to the first man he faced &#8211; the fourth walk allowed by the Bruins in the inning and the second with the bases loaded &#8211; and then a go-ahead two-run single to designated hitter Mason Marquez. The two-run lead had turned into a two-run deficit in one half inning.  Sophomore right-hander Sean Mullen was the sixth and final pitcher UCLA used in the inning, as he came on and struck out one batter for the final out of the four-run frame.  Mullen pitched the sixth and seventh innings and did not allow a run while striking out four.  Despite Mullen keeping the the Gauchos off the board, the Bruins didn't score either and were sent down in order in the sixth and seventh innings, and they couldn't capitalize on a leadoff single by Cardenas in the eighth.  The Gauchos also got their leadoff man aboard in the eighth, and he came around to score one of the two runs they added in the inning against senior right-hander Kyle Mora.   In the top of the ninth inning, the Bruins were able to get one run back, but it wasn't enough to best the Gauchos.  UCLA was without starting shortstop sophomore Matt McLain &#8211; the Bruins' team leader in batting average, on-base plus slugging, home runs and RBIs &#8211; who did not play for the first time this season.  The Bruins will return to Jackie Robinson Stadium, after going 3-1 on their first road trip of the season, to compete in the Southern California College Baseball Classic. UCLA is set to face No. 2 Vanderbilt on Friday and No. 22 Texas Christian on Saturday, before playing crosstown rival USC away Sunday.

Schools across the globe have shut their doors, fragmenting communities into singular pieces here, there and everywhere. Columnist Kennedy Hill tracks student artists across the globe, recounting the ways each person maintains artistic inspiration while adhering to the new normal.   Jessica Jones  unlike her Marvel comic counterpart  uses art instead of fists to help the world.  The third-year student studies biology, but beyond the classroom, she said she holds a deep passion for using art to strengthen her community. Maturing from childhood sketches with her father to hosting art lessons for fellow students, sketching and painting continue to be her driving forces, she said. While returning to her hometown of San Jose, California, has reconnected Jones to her artistic origins, she said the reliance of online communication has posed challenges to her mission of spreading art throughout the UCLA community.  ""A lot of people don't think they have artistic abilities, but they are actually capable of creating things that they're proud of,"" Jones said.   [Related:    Scattered Bruins: International students from China explore new art forms while in isolation   ]   As a kid, Jessica Jones watched her father, Darrell Jones, doodle caricatures in his free time, curious about how he brought figures to life on the page. Raised in Iowa, Darrell Jones said he developed his appreciation for art in college after backpacking across Europe. Harboring an artistic itch, he found himself constantly doodling in class, meetings and at home. Jessica Jones and her brother would call his exaggerated characters funny-looking, asking how he drew such big noses, Darrell Jones said.  To satiate their curiosity, Darrell Jones began holding mini-art lessons for his kids, teaching them how to convey emotion through eyes or draw hair in detail. Jessica Jones said these homeschool sessions with her father kick-started her lifelong pursuit of art. As he provided only basic sketching fundamentals ,  Darrel Jones said she advanced her skills on her own.  She has since exercised her creative muscles through various mediums, branching out to watercolor and acrylic paint. Often rendering the human face and form with abnormally proportioned, multicolored silhouettes, Jessica Jones describes her art style as psychedelic, experimenting with nature and eclectic colorization.  [caption id=""attachment_378892"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    In Jessica Jones' lifelong pursuit of art, she said she has enjoyed experimenting through different mediums. From watercolors to acrylic paint, Jones said she plays with abnormally proportioned human faces and bodies. (Courtesy of Jessica Jones)[/caption]  Walking in her father's footsteps a decade later, Jessica Jones founded stART, a club through which she hosts art lessons for novice students. She has moved her lessons from the Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden to Zoom but said she   misses the interaction and exchange of ideas enabled by hands-on teaching.  ""I like the in-person aspect (and) going around and suggesting, 'Oh, you could do this,"" Jessica Jones said. ""Now, at the end of (the lesson), I just say, 'What does it look like?'""   [Related:    International students speak on how they are impacted by COVID-19   ]   Esther Peluso, a third-year biochemistry student, joined stART in winter quarter and has continued attending the club's online sessions. Before meeting Jessica Jones, Peluso   said she did not think she had artistic potential, often dismissing the idea that she could learn how to draw or paint well. But as her talent has grown from Jessica Jones' teachings, now able to freehand basic figures, Peluso said she has become more comfortable with art  developing the initiative to practice on her own.  stART is Jessica Jones' method of encouraging students to explore art, but she also extends her teachings past campus through volunteer work. Before shelter-in-place orders, she worked with kids at Edmund D. Edelman Children's Court. She said she would fill the downtime during family court proceedings with art lessons and craft activities instead of anxious waiting.  ""I was volunteering with kids through art, and wanted more people to have that opportunity,"" Jessica Jones said.  Now fragmented from the Los Angeles community, Jessica Jones said she uses her time at home to reinvigorate the artistic relationship with her father. Darrel Jones said his daughter has now become the teacher in the house after surpassing his artistic skills. Jessica Jones has pushed her dad to try watercolor, her main medium.

The federal government launched the  Paycheck Protection Program  on April 3, intended to provide affordable low-interest loans to small businesses suffering from the effects of the pandemic. However, some Westwood businesses have had their applications rejected or have decided against applying because of program requirements.  The program exhausted its initial $349 billion in funding by April 16 because of high demand from businesses. The government initiated a second phase of the PPP on April 27 with an additional $321 billion in funding to meet demand.   The program offers loans at an interest rate of 1% and has a maturity of two years. The loans will be forgiven under specific conditions, primarily under the stipulation that the business must use at least 75% of the funds to cover payroll costs. This requirement incentivizes business owners to keep employees who would otherwise be laid off.  To be eligible for a PPP loan, a business must have less than 500 employees, with  some exceptions  listed by the United States Small Business Administration. Eligible businesses must apply through federally insured lenders, which tend to be community banks.  Most businesses in Westwood have not taken advantage of PPP funding, said Michael Skiles, president of the North Westwood Neighborhood Council. In some cases, owners have elected not to apply for federal loans, because the money would still be insufficient to keep their businesses afloat during the statewide shutdown caused by the pandemic, he added.  &#8220;(Some Westwood businesses) thought that getting a grant for eight weeks worth of payroll wasn't worth keeping the business open through months of COVID-19 followed by the typical summer lull,&#8221; Skiles said.  A number of other business owners had their loan applications rejected because of insufficient credit history with their local bank, Skiles said.  &#8220;When funding for these loans is scarce, and there are long lines of businesses trying to get access to them, businesses are more likely to succeed if they already have had an SBA loan and thus, an established relationship with the bank,&#8221; Skiles said.  Despite some concerns, the PPP has produced positive results overall for the U.S. economy, said William Yu, an economist at UCLA Anderson Forecast. Yu said falling unemployment applications during the month of April was evidence that the federal program has allowed businesses to retain employees they would otherwise have had to let go.  &#8220;PPP is really helping small businesses,&#8221; Yu said. &#8220;You see some businesses laying off employees but now using this money to hire back those same workers. While it&#8217;s not perfect, it is doing a very good job so far of mitigating economic suffering for small businesses.&#8221;  Since California Gov, Gavin Newsom issued the stay at home order back in March, consumer spending has  dropped dramatically , according to Forbes.  While sales have plummeted, fixed costs for business owners such as rent, utilities and insurance remained constant, pushing many Westwood businesses into deep financial trouble, said Andrew Thomas, executive director of the Westwood Village Improvement Association.  &#8220;Small businesses have taken a tremendous hit. Typically small businesses operate on very very narrow margins &#8211; an event like this (pandemic) is unprecedented,&#8221; Thomas said.  The two months of reduced operations caused by the stay-at-home order have been nothing short of catastrophic for businesses, Thomas said. Many owners have had to reduce their staff by more than half to cut costs.  A prolonged economic closure would likely force many establishments to close permanently, he added.  Headlines Diner and Grill owner Benny Mendez  said his daily revenue fell from $3,000 to $1,000 after the coronavirus pandemic hit. He applied for a PPP loan in early April but ultimately received no funding, as his lender had exhausted all available funds on other clients.  [caption caption=""Headlines Diner and Grill saw a drop in daily revenue from about $3,000 to $1,000 after the start of stay-at-home orders.

(Axel Lopez/Daily Bruin senior staff)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_380168"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   Mendez said he felt his bank prioritized larger businesses with established credit relationships over smaller entities like his own.   &#8220;For small businesses it&#8217;s so crucial to get anything at this point,&#8221; Mendez said. &#8220;To hear that these big corporations got funds before these small businesses was very disappointing.&#8221;  David Shulman, a senior economist at UCLA Anderson Forecast, said Mendez&#8217;s experience represented a common frustration during the PPP&#8217;s first phase. Credit institutions giving out these loans were not interested in smaller customers and prioritized their larger clients, he added.  Many small business owners have  heavily criticized  the PPP after reports surfaced in April that major corporations including Shake Shack, Ruth's Chris Steak House, and a number of major hotel chains received funding while smaller businesses had been denied loans.  Peter Clinco, owner of Skylight Gardens, an Italian restaurant in Westwood, said he was able to get his application for a PPP loan approved because of a prior professional relationship with his local lender. Other Westwood businesses weren&#8217;t so lucky, he added.  &#8220;A lot of my colleagues didn&#8217;t get a chance at that first wave of money because some big institutions front loaded themselves in,&#8221; Clinco said. &#8220;These banks reshuffled the deck to take care of their best customers,&#8221; he added.  Miguel Anaya, who owns Pinches Tacos with his brother Jose, said receiving PPP funding allowed their business to stay open longer than would otherwise have been possible and avoid laying off staff, after initial losses from the shutdown cost them 70% to 75% of their revenue.  Nevertheless, he said his experience with the program had still been somewhat frustrating. For instance, the requirement to spend three quarters of the funds on payroll restricted him from using the money to pay fixed costs such as rent.  &#8220;Landlords still expect their money, we still have to pay them,&#8221; Anaya said. &#8220;When you&#8217;re forced to shut down by the government and then you lose 75% of your revenue but are instructed to run your business the way that they want, it&#8217;s unfortunate.&#8221; ",['cap-stephen-wyer'],"['news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/ns.smallbusinessloans.AL_2.jpg

""Abducted,"" which was written around a month ago, follows the story of Jenny, who is trying to remember the events of a previous night where she believes she was taken by faceless men in black suits. The short film is directed by Augusto, a UCLA Extension student, who said he is exploring the elements of the unsettling horror and suspense   for his directing thesis. Filming starts in late March, and Augusto said he wants to see how far he can push the film's ambiguity so as to distract audiences from the truth.  &nbsp;  I wanted to lead the viewer into different directions, so I was just hinting that (Jenny) might have been abused,"" Augusto said. ""There are going to be some supernatural elements in the movie because she doesnt know if shes fabricating these experiences or not.   [Related:    Drag queen protagonist takes on horror genre in student film festival submission   ]   Augusto said he was interested in telling stories like those of the #MeToo movement, with a narrative that portrays a woman who feels harassed by businessmen, while operating within a horror genre. He said he wanted to be able to connect the alien abduction Jenny believes she experiences with experiences of post-traumatic stress disorder.   However, while he searches for the right way to tackle these themes, Augusto was still able to combine   them with the idea of paranoia   and society's hesitation to believe in women.  ""I wanted to ... present a woman who feels unsafe in society,"" Augusto said. ""Shes always surrounded and feels harassed by other men in the form of the stereotypical, white businessman attire.""    Since Augusto oversees all of the planning for the film, he said he is trying to maintain a balance between his vision and budget constraints. He needs to balance crew as well as equipment on a $1,000 budget. Although issues surely   will arise during production, Augusto said much of filming is taking those problems and adapting to them while conveying his desired vision.  Fourth-year economics student   Melissa Francikiewicz, who works as a grip and electric for the film, said the main difficulty challenging Augusto's vision is location. Since the set's location will be in a forest,   she said   she is concerned about   finding enough extension cords and electric generators to power all the necessary lights. However, Francikiewicz sees this as an opportunity to bring out the horror component of the film.  Doing a movie on a small budget is challenging to ensure everything looks bright for people to see whats going on but dark enough to still bring out that scary tone, Francikiewicz   said. But an isolated location is going to help channel that fear and that feeling of being completely lost in the woods.   [Related:    Graduate student aims to depict immigration anxieties in upcoming film   ]     The challenge of night shooting doesn't just fall on Francikiewicz, but also second-year computer science student   Neeraj Samtani, the visual effects director and digital imaging technician.   Samtani said much of his job will be ensuring all footage on set is properly stored and backed up as well as providing direction on how to angle each shot to help streamline the post-production process.  Working at night allows for more controlled lighting so the visual effects     can produce the exact desired image as well as having more leeway in crafting each effect, he said. Though Samtani is unable to disclose his visual effects creations until the film is released, he hopes the controlled lighting will help him develop the desired unsettling imagery.  Its a two-sided coin,"" Samtani   said.   Since its at night, a lot of things are going to be dark, and so you wont see the mistakes that I might make, but it also is nice to have things well-lit because some of the effects you need to do are like tracking an object into the scene.""  Although the film       will   face the difficulties of a night shoot in isolated locations  , Augusto   said h  e hopes ""Abducted"" can deliver an unnerving, Hitchcockian horror that leaves viewers at the edge of their   seat. Augusto said he wants to combine   the horror, murder and drama of Alfred Hitchcock while also addressing the #MeToo movement underlying the script.  I want (the audience) to be startled first so that they have a good emotional experience to get into the movie, Augusto said. Its a mix of emotion and intellect.

And nowhere is that more obvious than in the university&#8217;s official COVID-19 response website.  The site is housed through  UCLA Newsroom , but it's anything but newsworthy.  Because of the structure of the UCLA Newsroom site, all of the information is conveyed in long block lists and a series of links that makes finding the necessary information cumbersome and time consuming.  And if students manage to find the information, it's only a limited list of pandemic-related   financial and technical resources.   Emailed statements that the university regularly releases to students are available through the  UCLA Newsroom  and the  Bruins Safe Online sites  &#8211; but the former is nowhere to be found on the UCLA Newsroom homepage and the latter is organized in a frustratingly disjointed way. Simply put, UCLA is publishing the same information twice, without organizing either in an efficient or accessible way.   Because administration uses sites that aren&#8217;t designed to convey the huge amount of information that the university needs to, students are forced to filter through unnecessary text that makes getting information difficult.    UCLA needs to create a site explicitly dedicated to its coronavirus response &#8211; one that combines all the information from multiple sites and utilizes all   the resources at hand. These resources include student-led efforts, such as the Undergraduate Students Association Council's COVID-19 Relief Fund, which, as of now, are not very well advertised by the university.  It doesn't have to be aesthetically pleasing, but these sites must be accessible and easy to navigate.   Perhaps the biggest problem with UCLA&#8217;s coronavirus site is that many don&#8217;t even know it exists. A simple Google search yields dozens of results in addition to the official UCLA Newsroom site, all of which offer links to other UCLA-related sites that have some resources &#8211; but not all. This vast and unorganized network makes getting information an unnecessarily difficult task.  The process is so cumbersome that it begs the question of why UCLA would even bother labeling a site as official if students have to constantly redirect to other pages for answers.  According to UCLA spokesperson Katherine Alvarado, the official UCLA coronavirus site will continue to be housed through UCLA Newsroom, which means that students will be forced to rely on the administration&#8217;s email announcements in the absence of something more reliable.  But these emails are often just as dense and difficult to navigate.  &#8220;I really don&#8217;t even delve into the emails because there&#8217;s very little actual substance to most of them, I think,&#8221; said Garrett Powers, a second-year business economics student.  This reflects a consistent problem with the university's announcements: long statements that ultimately say very little. Students who read these emails are often left more confused than when they started &#8211; and with very little in the way of online support, students have few options to get consistent updates.  All of the email announcements are listed on the Bruins Safe Online and UCLA Newsroom's ""Messages to the UCLA community"" website. On Bruins Safe Online, they are labeled with generic titles listed one after the other, followed by little description of their content. UCLA Newsroom&#8217;s attempt just adds to the chaos by publishing the same email announcement as Bruins Safe Online just with a different label.  This lackluster effort at communication is compounded by the administration&#8217;s failure to promote the resources student organizations have made available.  Conspicuously missing from both sites are resources available to students through school organizations such as USAC and the Student Wellness Commission &#8211; both of which have their own websites and support systems for students.  Mannat Sukhija, a fourth-year microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics student and current chief of staff for SWC, said the resources available through the  SWC  are substantial.  &#8220;We have a lot of events during the spring that unfortunately won&#8217;t be happening this year,  "" Sukhija  said. ""But we used all the resources that would have gone into those and we established these two grants that we've set up in writing to help students out there facing additional financial distress during this time.&#8221;  A student wouldn&#8217;t be able to find out about these grants through UCLA&#8217;s official website, however, which means that this important resource meant to help students during this difficult time could be left underutilized.  Even beyond direct financial support, the USAC Office of the Internal Vice President has compiled an  extensive list  of on- and off-campus resources available to students that could serve as a model on what should be included in UCLA&#8217;s own site.   But despite having a plethora of websites, UCLA still failed to make room for these resources.  To be fair, creating a whole new website and compiling all of the necessary information is difficult given all the disruptions caused by the coronavirus, and UCLA&#8217;s current site is better than nothing. However, UCLA&#8217;s efforts to communicate with its student body are inadequate, and with major changes likely to persist well into next year, the university needs to commit to providing clear information. It is in the best interest of both students and the university to create a more thorough site that takes advantage of the wealth of student organizations and resources available on campus.  For now, students can hope the university agrees.  But until then, they will just have to read Chancellor   Gene Block&#8217;s long-winded emails.

But just like anywhere, bad things do happen.   If you&#8217;re lucky, your only interaction with danger is through reading about it.  But for many Bruins, reading about it stops after the subject line of an email &#8211; and feeling informed about campus safety is harder than it should be.  In the status quo, students are kept up to date about incidences on campus through two separate systems of alerts: BruinAlerts and UCPD Clery Timely Warnings. BruinAlerts are emergency notifications for situations involving an immediate threat to the safety of the UCLA community, while Clery Timely Warnings report crimes near or on campus property that present a serious or continuing threat. Both alerts are sent to all registered UCLA email addresses.  While campus officials at the moment are rightfully most concerned about COVID-19, it is important that transparency regarding campus safety is not forgotten.    And communication between UCPD and students could use some improvement.  UCPD's Clery Timely Warnings are, at best, meeting the bare minimum. They comply with federal law, make basic safety information available to students and theoretically allow the community to make safer decisions.  However, the UCPD Clery Timely Warning emails can be vague and confusing for students, creating a lack of clarity about what&#8217;s happening on campus. The emails' subjects state the official crime, but students must open a crime report to learn any more information.  The email system itself does not prove to be a substantial information barrier. What is concerning, however, is that once the initial threat has passed,  students are not updated with further information. Unclear updates on the development of crime-related situations can encourage speculation and rumor, which is a threat to campus safety too. UCPD must be working to more effectively follow up and notify students of changes to initial crime reports if it wants to give students any peace of mind &#8211; especially upon entering a post-pandemic world where anxieties will already be high.  From a student&#8217;s perspective, UCPD's system isn't meeting its main goal: to communicate useful information about crimes on campus or in the immediate Westwood community to students.   Gurkriti Ahluwalia, a third-year marine biology student, said she felt safe on campus until  an assault happened  at Hitch Suites in January. Now she said she feels uncertain about campus safety &#8211; because aside from knowing that   something indeed happened, she hardly knew anything else.  Ahluwalia said she wishes there was an easier way to learn about incidences like this one, but said she doesn&#8217;t have the time or the know-how to effectively read the full police report.  And she&#8217;s not the only one sharing these feelings.  Randa Yousef, a third-year aerospace engineering student, said she felt pretty good about campus safety until around the same time as Ahluwalia.  She said while her resident assistants helped her feel safe, she felt that the UCPD emails could have been more helpful if they provided more information on the status of the crime after the initial alert.  But students shouldn't have to rely on their peers for details when a police department exists on campus.  Recognizing this, student government is trying to increase student consideration when it comes to transparency about campus safety. The UCLA Campus Safety Alliance, which seeks student involvement with administration, was revived in 2018 following concerns that students weren&#8217;t involved enough in creating campus policies.  &#8220;When creating campus safety policies, we felt like students were considered an afterthought,&#8221; said Undergraduate Students Association Council Internal Vice President Kimberly Bonifacio and acting chair of CSA. &#8220;We need to be there throughout the whole process.&#8221;  Perhaps student collaboration could help increase transparency. But the burden shouldn&#8217;t continue to fall on students alone for campuswide safety initiatives.  That's a job for UCLA administrators.    Bruins already juggling their busy lives should be able to expect clear information and transparent safety practices on their campus. And while involvement at a student government level is beneficial, it shouldn't feel so necessary.  After all, it's not as though crime has halted while campus is shut.   In just the last two weeks, two student residences near campus were  burglarized . Students were notified through the UCPD Clery Timely Warning system, but since the initial emails, they have not received any updates on the situations or on UCPD precautions. By keeping students in the dark with poor communication, especially when Bruins are spread across the globe, UCPD precludes students from taking necessary and adequate steps to keep themselves or their things safe.  Lt. Scott Scheffler from the Community Services Division of UCPD said because there are multiple Timely Warnings throughout the year, they do not want to overwhelm the community with emails.  Certainly, an inundation of emails would be unnecessary and unfeasible for a campus of 45,000 students. However, the nature of UCPD&#8217;s alerts seems to be geared at meeting the bare minimum, rather than fitting the needs and demands of students. UCPD could, at the very least, provide students with the tools to learn more about recent safety issues.  But by continuing to aim for only for what&#8217;s required of them, UCPD prevents students the ability to be fully educated on their surrounding community. And feeling out of the loop can equate with feeling unsafe for many students.   So, to truly protect community members, UCPD first needs to better inform them.  Otherwise, UCLA's campus will seem like just another place where bad things happen without much explanation.

Moore held a candlelight vigil for Floyd, a Black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, as Los Angeles entered its 10th straight day of protests against police brutality and racial injustice.    To George Floyd, may he rest in peace, and may his memory be social justice, social reform and fairness for all, Moore said at the vigil, as he and community faith leaders raised electronic candles to the sky at LAPD headquarters.    But in front of the fences surrounding police headquarters, hundreds of protesters mourning Floyds death did not participate in the vigil and instead questioned LAPDs ongoing history of violence, especially against Black people.    In the past week, the LAPD has used rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and tear gas to contain the protests, some of which have    been violent   . Moore previously said LAPD used force in response to police injuries caused by objects that some protesters threw. According to multiple media reports, LAPD officers have also injured numerous protesters, journalists and even a homeless man in a wheelchair with rubber bullets.    Even after both sides denounced violent protests, reports of police brutality persisted while officers started enforcing a countywide curfew. The police beat peaceful protesters with batons and arrested hundreds at a time for violating curfew. Some protesters shared photos of wounds from rubber bullets on social media. A video of a police car hitting at least one protester in Downtown LA went viral, prompting a struck protester to file a government claim.   https://twitter.com/SophiaLeeHyun/status/1267216604388978689?s=20   Theyve been smirking and cracking their knuckles at me, a Black protester in the crowd told Moore. Theyve been sticking their little rubber bullet launchers in peoples faces at peaceful protests. That is not accountability. ... Theyre not turning their body cams on. They put them on, they turn them off when everythings bad. So whats going to happen when they dont listen to you?&nbsp;    Protesters mostly directed their anger at Moore and the law enforcement system, demanding the immediate removal of Moore and LA County District Attorney Jackie Lacey from their positions. Moore spent 15 minutes after the vigil joining fellow officers in talking to protesters, but many said his responses left them unsatisfied.    Elijah Trejo, a Black hospital worker from Pasadena, was one of several protesters that spoke to Moore. Trejo asked if Moore could promise police reforms to address racial injustice, but was disappointed by Moores reply.&nbsp;    He was like, Yes, we're going to try to, but that's not a for-sure answer, right? Trejo said. We don't need him to try or hope for the best. We need him to actually do it. We need him to say it.    Trejo said Moores lack of clear commitment did not make him feel safer.    I appreciate him trying to talk to me, Trejo said. But that doesn't matter because I need him to make us feel safe. We shouldn't be in this (protest). This shouldn't be happening. Why does all this have to happen first to have a slight change or first get treated fairly?

Gisselle Espinoza said the vigil was a step forward in building dialogue and understanding with the community.    We may never satisfy everybody, but I think this was much needed, Espinoza said. Sometimes, things have to be said before we can get to a point where we can actually sit down and talk and learn about each other.    Espinoza said some people had stronger emotions about the death of Floyd and were not open to dialogue.    They kind of wanted to yell, and I understand that too, Espinoza said. I wish it could have been a little more productive when the chief of police is available for the public to really ask him questions about what he thinks, what his philosophies are, how he feels and his plan moving forward.    Moore said the departments issues centered around problematic officers, an argument often criticized by pundits and activists.    We've also had our bad apples, we've had our occasions, and nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop,    Moore told KFI AM 640   . What these protesters are about are not about the good cops, and that's what we need to get into a conversation, that policing in America is not homogeneous. It's not just one flavor.    Dozens of protesters shouted expletives at Moore as he retreated from public view.

The switch to virtual classes has left dance students searching for ideal spaces to move ,    relying on self-accountability to stay motivated, said third-year dance student Justin Gamboa. Although professors have adapted their course materials to mold to the spaces each dancer has available to them through increased journaling and posting the dances online ahead of class,   Gamboa said it has been difficult to get an individualized experience. He said he chose to stay enrolled this quarter because the close community within the dance program provides   support during this stressful time of uncertainty.  The community is very tightknit, Gamboa said. ""(The professors) are good at keeping our emotional and mental health in mind.  Gamboa said since he is a resident assistant on the Hill, he has been using his floors lounge as a makeshift dance studio for his classes. Most of his   courses are not too demanding in regard to the space required as many focus on his own research and discovery through improvisation, he said. To keep up with the course material, Gamboa said each dancer performs movements differently because they have to cater to the smaller spaces available to them compared to the large, mirrored dance studios of Glorya Kaufman Hall.   [Related:    Event to showcase student skills through art exhibit, performative dances   ]     Using art as a stabilizer, Gamboa said he is mostly struggling with the battle between being creatively unmotivated yet having to immerse himself in classes that demand constant movement and energy. Although some of his Zoom dance classes have optional attendance, Gamboa said the dance program's reliance on self-accountability and exploration rather than traditional techniques is something he has been practicing now more than ever.  The fact that I get up out of bed and stay in my room the whole day is really hard to deal with, Gamboa said. Especially when you are in a course like dance where you need to be moving.  Virtual instruction also creates a barrier between the dancers and the professor, and Gamboa said students' application of technical corrections are self-reliant. He said every dancer is responsible for the progression of their own technique, especially because there is no real way for professors to know if dancers are implementing their critiques  . In Gamboa's case, he said he is focusing inward to feel even the smallest movements in his body during his classes such as Dance 160: ""Topics in Body Mechanics: Alexander Technique and Practice of Performance,"" which   aims to release unnecessary tension.  It depends on what kind of technique you are striving for, Gamboa said. Developing the mental technique of discipline and being able to explore different ideas is something people are expanding on during this time.  Despite returning home this quarter, third-year dance and psychobiology student Ally Wade said the modifications professors give out, such as having several variations for every combination, allow her to fully navigate her smaller space. For her floor work class, she said she uses her kitchen because the hardwood is more slippery and better suited for the movements. As for matching dances to her available space, Wade said directionality and spatial awareness are the most crucial and particular changes that dancers make during class, as movements can be adapted to fit the depth and length of each student's space.  We have to make online modifications on ourselves as we move, which is a new experience, Wade said. Rather than navigating space with other dancers, we have to navigate the space with inanimate objects but still keep moving.   [Related:    Graduate student invites audience interaction in her 6-hour dance performance   ]   With faculty also navigating online instruction, Adjunct Professor Ros Warby, who teaches the Dance 160 course, said the learning process has shifted drastically from a hands-on relationship with her students to relying solely on dialogue. Warby said she uses a model skeleton to demonstrate the mechanics of the body, which is essential in learning to relax the body in Alexander Technique.  Her dancers are all able to physically participate during Zoom lectures, and Warby said she has restructured her course to focus more on anatomical information and image-based learning, gradually shifting to dances with smaller movements. She said this allows the dancers to familiarize themselves with the Alexander style before integrating the movements in their minimal spaces.     We are unfortunately not getting the opportunity to practice what we are learning, Warby said. We are focusing the next half of the course on small dances and trying to integrate the information through a dance that is smaller, subtler and can be contained in the space available.  Since Gamboa is currently void of physical interactions with other dancers,   he said he is most looking forward to getting back to the connections and community fostered within the dance program. In the meantime, however, he said the reassuring nature of the professors and his own dedication to his craft will help him through this trying, difficult quarter of virtual dance instruction.  There was a lot of stress to perform well, especially if I was going to be struggling, Gamboa said. But I have my faith in the dance program. I know the dance faculty are on our side and care about us a lot, which takes a lot of weight from me.",['cap-yasmin-madjidi'],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.wacdonline.ADX_.jpg

The Luskin Lecture for Thought Leadership, where Goodall was slated to speak, has postponed the event from April 1 to an unspecified date in light of a new campus policy mandating that all in-person gatherings of more than 100 people on campus must be suspended or postponed.  The policy stemmed from the outbreak of COVID-19, which has spread to over 100 countries since first emerging in Wuhan, China, in December.

As the coronavirus traverses the United States, it simultaneously bares and intensifies the deep divisions within the nation, meaning America&#8217;s most socioeconomically vulnerable populations   may be left to bear the brunt of the calamity.   For example,  individual state reports  reveal the disproportionate toll the virus seems to be taking on African American populations.   While African Americans represent only 14% of the population of Michigan, they account for 33% of coronavirus deaths as of April 17. Illinois reveals an even more jarring set of numbers  : Chicago has a black population of 32%, and 72% of the city's COVID-19 deaths come from this population.   These numbers are no mere coincidence &#8211; in a nation where racial identification and socioeconomic status are inextricably related, a disaster seems to exacerbate preexisting inequalities that have historically marginalized low-income populations and people of color.   Since the first detected novel coronavirus case in the U.S. on Jan. 21, the number of cases nationwide has risen to over 800,000. As the U.S. struggles to keep the onslaught of COVID-19 cases at bay, an increasing number of states have implemented official stay-at-home orders in an attempt to alleviate the overwhelmed health care system.       [Related:    Small businesses discuss difficulties, adjustments under safer-at-home order ]     California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a mandatory stay-at-home order on March 19, shutting down all nonessential services and enacting more stringent social-distancing practices. Similarly, on March 22, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a closing of all nonessential businesses and gatherings, ordering all workers to stay at home.      These orders are deemed critical guidelines all Americans must follow to ensure their safety, but not every American can partake in extensive periods of social distancing at home.  For instance, one   must have enough space to reap the protective benefits of isolation in the first place &#8211; this is a discrepancy that has wreaked havoc on New York City&#8217;s public housing system and its tenants.   With the city&#8217;s shortage of affordable housing, many low-income New Yorkers find themselves living in small, cramped apartments. During this pandemic, many residents are seeing the alarming health risks and challenges with crowding that come with cheaper housing.   According to  Politico,  many of the tenants living in the apartments under the New York City Housing Authority are frontline workers during this crisis who come back home from work to tight living conditions.   Low-wage workers are particularly vulnerable to being positioned in front of difficult decisions with very limited fiscal flexibility: Go to work and potentially get infected or stay at home and risk starvation.   In a country where this vulnerability intersects with poverty and race, lower-wage, lower-income households that are less likely to have savings to fall back on tend to be disproportionately black and Latino households,  according to Vox .   Data collected by the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  show less than 30% of American workers can work from home.  According to the Economic Policy Institute , the racial and ethnic breakdown of this data reveals large imbalances, with less than one in five black workers and approximately one in six Hispanic workers able to work from home.   The impact of COVID-19 on the American workforce has shed a light on the particularly   hard-hit low-wage workers of color.   Nadereh Pourat, a professor-in-residence at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and adjunct professor at the UCLA School of Dentistry, said the workforce in service industries and retail businesses are dramatically impacted because of an inability to operate through online interfaces.  &#8220;Restaurants and stores are unable to operate in the same way they did before, so the workers in these businesses are either laid off or their jobs are   severely restricted,&#8221; Pourat said.   In addition, the workers who face the highest risk of termination are often the same individuals who cannot afford to forgo income for an extended period of time.    According to the U.S. Department of Labor,  more than 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the past week.   While those with enough amassed wealth are able to maintain the same standard of living during lockdown, some blue-collar and low-income workers grapple with a ticking time bomb as they struggle to obtain basic necessities and go about their day to day.  Staying home is a luxury not everyone can afford, and we see the people who are the least able to cope with the repercussions of this virus having to go to work, Pourat said.   With the running of essential businesses, low-wage workers have increasingly become the backbone of a functioning society, working around the clock to deliver packages, restock grocery store shelves and clean the streets.  The &#8220;unskilled&#8221; jobs that are positioned on the frontlines of sustaining society&#8217;s basic necessities during this health crisis are also the ones that are paid the least and oftentimes not given the necessary protection they need to work.  According to  The   New York Times , 41 New York City transit workers have died and around 1,500 have tested positive as of April 8. Likewise,    The Washington Post  has reported the deaths of workers at major grocery store chains such as Trader Joe's and Walmart.   [Related:    Los Angeles expands COVID-19 testing to all essential workers, regardless of symptoms ]       While these workers face high exposure to the virus on a daily basis, many still face barriers to accessing proper health care in the case of coronavirus contraction.   The COVID-19 pandemic has also revealed a series of   disparities within the health care system, starting with testing.  Some states require individuals be referred by a primary care physician in order to be tested &#8211; a referral that people of color may be less likely to receive. According to an Economic Policy Institute analysis, only roughly 10% of workers earning $10.48 or less an hour have health insurance.   Similarly, the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. is a primary example of the risk that can be undertaken when there is no social safety net present for lost jobs.   Unable to receive federal help such as the economic impact payment, which provides up to $1,200 per individual, undocumented immigrants face an economic burden that cannot be alleviated with subsidized support.   A large majority of the undocumented population do not have the cost protection of health insurance, so if they contract the coronavirus and must be hospitalized, they could be liable for charges they are not able to afford, Pourat said.   Moreover, the fear of being identified by immigration enforcement continues to hang over the heads of undocumented individuals. Despite the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stating its refrainment from operating near medical facilities during this time, the agency's track record hardly alleviates concerns of deportation.  &#8220;We have people that might be infected, but aren&#8217;t getting tested due to this worry and fear,&#8221; Pourat said. &#8220;So there&#8217;s this ripple effect of having policies that don&#8217;t really work well for the overall public health and well-being of everyone &#8211; and then us feeling the dire consequences of this as a society.&#8221;   While officials and the general public scramble to pick up the pieces of the moving target that is the novel coronavirus, the question is raised if this virus is cutting into issues that are merely a few months deep &#8211; or ones that have perhaps plagued America for centuries.

Here are the Daily Bruin's superlative awards for the past school year.    Female Athlete of the Year: Kyla Ross   Coral Smith, Daily Bruin senior staff   [caption id=""attachment_385317"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""665""]    (Mackenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  When discussing the UCLA Female Athlete of the Year, there's only one name that comes to mind.  UCLA gymnastics senior Kyla Ross has wrapped up her career competing for the Bruins, and her final campaign was full of great routines and accolades.  At the end of the abridged 2020 season, Ross ranked in the top five nationally in four individual rankings. She ranked No. 1 in the nation on uneven bars for the fourth consecutive year behind two perfect 10s, and also finished No. 2 on balance beam, No. 3 in the all-around and No. 4 on floor exercise. While she ranked No. 11 on vault this season, the senior did score a perfect 10 in this event in the Bruins' final meet of the season.  Ross' three perfect scores in 2020 brought her to a career total of 22 perfect 10s  the fourth most in NCAA history  despite the year getting cut short.  In addition, Ross collected 10 scores of 9.975 in 2020, meaning one of the two judges thought her routine deserved a perfect score.  For her efforts, Ross earned first-team All-America honors in the all-around, bars, beam and floor and second-team honors on vault, and was named the Region and Pac-12 Gymnast of the Year for the second year in a row.  These accomplishments also earned the senior the prestigious 2020 Honda Award for gymnastics, and the honor of being named a finalist for both the AAI Award for the nation's top senior gymnast and the AAU James E. Sullivan Award for the nation's top amateur athlete.  There's no doubt that Ross was the greatest UCLA female athlete this past year, capping off her competitive career with a flourish.  Luckily, with Ross committed to returning in 2021 as a student assistant coach, we'll get one more year of watching her in Pauley Pavilion, though in a different capacity.      Male Athlete of the Year: Milan Iloski   Marcus Veal, Daily Bruin staff   [caption id=""attachment_385318"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Daanish Bhatti/Assistant Photo Editor)[/caption]  Milan Iloski scored more than a quarter of his Pac-12-leading 17 goals in one night.  In a 5-2 win over San Diego State on Oct. 6, the junior forward potted all five of his team's goals  setting a new program record for goals scored in a single game. The leading scorer in the Pac-12 and fourth-leading scorer in the NCAA, Iloski was coach Ryan Jorden's go-to attacker all season.  Iloski had more goals scored than starts for UCLA men's soccer in 2019  and he started in all but three games for the Bruins this season.  The Escondido, California, native wasn't always the center of UCLA's offense, however. In his first two seasons, Iloski only found the back of the net six times in 21 starts. But in 2019, he was responsible for almost 59% of the Bruins' scoring, 34% of UCLA's total shots and 43% of the team's shots on goal.  A month prior to his record-breaking performance, Iloski netted a hat trick in UCLA's come-from-behind, upset win over then No. 1 Maryland on Sept. 6.  The numbers Iloski put up this season earned him a plethora of postseason awards, including Pac-12 All-Conference First Team, First Team All-Far West Region and Second Team All-America by College Soccer News.  Following those accolades, Iloski signed a deal with Major League Soccer's Real Salt Lake in January, leaving UCLA without its top scorer next season. And as the Bruins look to qualify for their first NCAA tournament under Jorden's leadership, UCLA's attackers will undoubtedly have a very large pair of shoes to fill.   Coach of the Year: Cori Close   Dylan D'Souza, Daily Bruin staff   [caption id=""attachment_385319"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Daily Bruin File Photo)[/caption]  Coach Cori Close led her team to their highest win percentage of her nine-year tenure with UCLA womens basketball. She did this in the toughest conference in the country  the Pac-12 had six ranked teams in the final Associated Press poll for the first time ever. All of the Bruins' losses came against Pac-12 foes, and they were never defeated by the same team twice this season.  The Bruins raced off to a 16-0 start  the longest winning streak to begin the season in the nation and the best start in program history  before an ill-timed ankle injury to leading scorer junior forward Michaela Onyenwere precipitated their Jan. 17 double overtime loss to USC at the Galen Center.  Close also impelled the emergence of freshman guard Charisma Osborne, who led the team in 3-point percentage and was second on the team in conference scoring. Redshirt junior guard Natalie Chou burst onto the scene on the court, but also found her voice politically, taking a stance against anti-Asian racism in a message that went viral, all the while having Close's support.  While the Pac-12 tournament ended unceremoniously for UCLA, falling to Stanford in the semifinals, redshirt senior guard Japreece Dean successfully went professional, getting drafted by the Chicago Sky. Close wrapped up the year recruiting far and wide, from Germany to Australia, forming the program's first fully international recruiting class.  Closes third top-10 final ranking in the past five years  coupled with retaining most of her team's core  bodes well for the future of womens basketball in Westwood as it continues to be guided by Daily Bruin Sports' Coach of the Year.   Rookie of the Year: Maya Brady   Vinny Lavalsiti, Daily Bruin staff   [caption id=""attachment_385323"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""713""]    (David Rimer/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  Under the lights of Easton Stadium, freshman infielder Maya Brady was penciled into the cleanup spot for her first game as a Bruin.  And after a first-inning double and a solo blast to centerfield two at-bats later against CSU Bakersfield, Brady  No. 1 UCLA softballs top recruit from the 2019 class  solidified her position in the heart of the Bruins lineup for its 25-1 start to the season. In her very first weekend in Westwood, Brady earned both the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week and Player of the Week awards after hits in each of UCLA's first six games, including four home runs.  Few Jolly Ranchers were sweeter than the one Brady snagged from third-base coach Kirk Walker after hitting arguably her most impressive home run of the season. In an exhibition against the undefeated USA Olympic Team on Feb. 23 at the Mary Nutter Classic, Brady hit an opposite-field rocket to put the Bruins up 3-1 and the Olympians down on the scoreboard for the first time in their Stand Beside Her Tour. The Bruins may have lost the game, but Brady's impact with UCLA remained until the season's abrupt end.  Brady, with seven home runs and tied for first on the team with 28 RBIs, led a UCLA squad that was the 2020 Women's College World Series favorite, according to USA Softball.  Just like her uncle and six-time Super Bowl Champion Tom Brady, Maya Brady showed up on the biggest of stages  winning 2020 Softball America Freshman of the Year honors in her premiere season.  The only question now is where Brady will fit into next year's lineup with redshirt senior pitcher/first base Rachel Garcia, senior utility Bubba Nickles and last year's seniors returning to the roster.   Most Clutch Performer: Jaime Jaquez Jr.   Sam Connon, Daily Bruin senior staff   [caption id=""attachment_385324"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""647""]    (Daily Bruin File Photo)[/caption]  UCLA made dozens of clutch plays across all sports this year, but one stood above the rest.  Women's volleyball pulled out a five-set upset win over USC on Sept. 25, football staged a 32-point comeback in the second half to beat Washington State on Sept. 21, and women's basketball redshirt junior guard Natalie Chou drilled a buzzer-beating 3 that forced double overtime against the Trojans and nearly extended the Bruins' undefeated season Jan. 17.  Instead, the award goes to another Bruin basketball player in his first season in blue and gold  freshman guard/forward Jaime Jaquez Jr.  UCLA men's basketball was riding a five-game winning streak into its late-February homestand against the Arizona schools and was on the cusp of inserting itself into the March Madness discussion.  But with a minute to go against Arizona State  which had handed the Bruins their only loss in their last eight games  UCLA was down by one. A free throw by redshirt freshman guard Tyger Campbell evened up the score with 40 seconds to go, and after forcing a missed 3-pointer on the defensive end, coach Mick Cronin drew up a play for Jaquez.  Campbell took the ball in, passed to a trailing Jaquez, set a screen and let the freshman do the rest. Jaquez hoisted up a deep 3-pointer while falling away from the basket, and the sellout crowd packing Pauley Pavilion erupted when they saw it fall.  It was the first true viral moment for men's basketball this season after it started the campaign 18-11. The Bruins were hot and making a postseason push, but Jaquez's shot at the buzzer put them on the national radar for good.  The timing couldn't have been better either, since then-assistant Sports editor Jared Tay wrote a feature profile on Jaquez that was set to publish later that night, regardless of the outcome of the Arizona State game.  So, for his performance in high-stakes situations and near-perfect narrative timing, Jaquez takes home Daily Bruin Sports' most clutch performer award.   Most Improved: Matt McLain   Jared Tay, Daily Bruin senior staff   [caption id=""attachment_385326"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Andy Bao/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  Baseball is a numbers game, and the numbers don't lie.  As a freshman for UCLA baseball in 2019, shortstop Matt McLain batted just above the Mendoza Line at .203. In 2020, his average nearly doubled and the sophomore was batting .397 before the Bruins' season was canceled.  Only 13 games into the season, McLain had tallied 23 hits  more than half of his total in 61 games played last season. In these 13 games, he logged nearly two-thirds of his RBI total from the 2019 campaign and was slugging .621.  McLain led his team with three home runs and topped the team stat sheet in nearly every other offensive category  including hits, batting average, slugging percentage, total bases and on-base plus slugging.  As the Bruins' No. 3 hitter, McLain ended the season on an eight-game hitting streak and went only one game without notching a hit.  The sophomore's breakout year earned him a number of accolades in the abbreviated season, including Pac-12 Player of the Week on March 3 after he had been named MVP of the Frisco College Classic in Frisco, Texas, that weekend.  McLain finished as the nation's No. 3 shortstop in D1Baseball's power rankings when the season had come to a close, after beginning the season ranked No. 26.  Of course, the title of ""Most Improved"" generally implies that the player's preceding season was sub-par, and McLain's case is no exception. His freshman year stats undoubtedly set the bar lower for a drastic improvement his second year.  Some might argue that 13 games is too small a sample to adequately assess the shortstop's season. McLain only logged 58 at-bats in 2020. It's entirely fair to chalk up his numbers to an early-season hot-streak.  But if one looks at the numbers, there's no way that a player can nearly double his stats in multiple offensive categories and yet still be glossed over for this superlative.  Fluke or not, the numbers don't lie.   Best Social Media: Felicia Hano   Ryan Smith, Daily Bruin senior staff   [caption id=""attachment_385327"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Tanmay Shankar/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  UCLA gymnast Felicia Hano is a national champion, a six-time All-American and a four-time All-Pac-12 honoree.  She is also the owner of a TikTok account with two million likes.  Hano uploaded her first post on the popular video-sharing app just seven months ago on Nov. 21 under the username @fish_hano, but since has accumulated more than 62,900 followers and 15 million views.  The graduating senior posts everything from trendy dance routines to pizza-making montages, and even sneaks in clips of UCLA mens basketball redshirt senior forward Alex Olesinski from time to time.  Olesinski also happens to star in Hanos most viral TikTok  which has been viewed more than 11 million times  poking fun at how Olesinski ended up being nine inches taller than either of his parents. Just to put that into perspective, 11 million people is enough to fill Pauley Pavilion to capacity 857 times over.  Hano isnt one-dimensional on social media, either.  For those who vow to never download TikTok, Hano can be found on Instagram under the handle @felicia_hano, where she posts photos of herself competing in gymnastics meets or hanging out with teammates, and even sprinkles in the occasional throwback of her watching UCLA gymnastics as a kid.  Hano may have only scored one perfect 10 while competing for the Bruins, but shes racking up plenty of perfect scores online.   Best Dancer: Nia Dennis       Riley Segal, Daily Bruin reporter   [caption id=""attachment_385328"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""739""]    (Mia Kayser/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  Its Nia Dennis floor, and UCLA is just living on it.  The junior, dubbed Nianation by fans, was the only Bruin to have their routine go viral during the 2020 season, garnering over 20 million views. Dennis tumbled and incorporated modern dance moves across the floor to a medley of songs from Beyoncs hit album Homecoming with encouraging yells from her teammates and loud applause from the Bruin faithful. She had the crowd in Pauley Pavilion on its feet, dancing her routine with her.  Soon after the video started blowing up on Twitter, the shoutouts began to pour in. Celebrities such as Alicia Keys and Gabrielle Union tweeted at her, and Dennis even scored an invite to be a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.  Her modified version of the routine on Ellen would be the last time Dennis performed this year, as the remainder of the 2020 season was canceled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the abrupt ending, Dennis walked away with a six-meet streak  lasting up until her final competition of the season  and finishing in a top-three spot on floor. The gymnast also won floor in two of her last three meets, against Utah and Cal.  In the the meet against Utah  coincidentally the meet where she went viral  Dennis tied her highest score of the season: a 9.975.  Though the pandemic cut her season short, Dennis has one more year left with UCLA gymnastics  one more year for UCLA to live in a world watching Nianation.","['cap-coral-smith', 'cap-marcus-veal', 'cap-dylan-dsouza', 'cap-vinny-lavalsiti', 'cap-sam-connon', 'cap-jared-tay', 'cap-ryan-smith', 'cap-riley-segal']","['sports', 'sports-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/sp.gradissuesuperlatives.coverphoto.jpg

And neither does USAC.  This years election saw two referendums on the ballot, both of which sought to increase student fees. The Cultivating Unity For Bruin Referendum called for a $15 quarterly  fee , while the Good Clothes Good People Basic Needs Referendum asked students to pay an additional  99 cents  each year. Only the latter passed.  And to increase voter turnout and give money back to students, the USA   Elections Board and USAC decided to incentivize voters with gift cards that collectively cost both bodies   a whopping     total of $15,000.  While $15,000 represents just a tiny fraction of USAC's and USAs budgets, spending money on such a frivolous expenditure while simultaneously asking students to pay more in student fees is irresponsible. In the midst of a global pandemic, $15,000 would go a long way in helping students who actually need the money. Moving forward, students need to have a greater say over where their money goes and how it's being spent. And by voting against CUB, the student body has already shown that it cares where its money goes.    It's the very least students deserve from two on-campus institutions that claim to have their best interests at heart.  Its important to note that USAC doesnt have total discretion to decide how student funds are spent. Former USAC President Robert Watson said the council can reallocate funds within a particular expense category, but it cant indiscriminately take money meant for one project and move it wherever the council sees fit.  ""There is a misconception about how USAC can just move around its money,"" Watson said. ""Every year, USAC has a surplus. This year, because things were moved online, we did have a surplus of contingency funds that we could move around for contingency-related programming.""  So instead of putting the money into the recently  created  COVID-19 Relief Fund where it could help students in need, USAC wasted $15,000 on a gimmick.  USACs inability to effectively utilize funds during a global health crisis shows just how ineffectual the governing body at UCLA truly is. Students trust the council with exorbitant amounts of money, yet USAC doesnt even appear to be in control of its own spending decisions.  Gurkriti Ahluwalia, a third-year marine biology student, chose to vote because she wanted to have a say in the way UCLA is run.  I didnt vote to win a gift card, Ahluwalia said. I really thought the referendums were important.  Based on voter turnout in years past, the gift cards also seem to have done very little to influence students' decisions to vote.  While this years voter  turnout  of 30.06% nearly doubled last years abysmal 16.18%, its not much higher than the voter turnout in 2017 or 2018, which sat at 27.5% and 26.5%, respectively.  This year's increase in voter turnout might speak to the greater number of candidates and referendums on the ballot. Last year, 16 candidates ran for office and no referendums were voted on, while 30 candidates ran this year and the ballot contained the two aforementioned referendums.  Theres no way to tell whether the gift card incentive actually convinced students to vote, but it seems unlikely that it swayed many Bruins who would otherwise not have cast their ballots.     But some officials are just happy they could give some student money back.  In an  interview  with The Bruin earlier this month, USA Elections Board Chair Navi Sidhu said he thought this was good way to give some money back to the student body in light of current circumstances. Despite the nice sentiment, this money only went to a select number of students who may not even need the additional financial support to begin with.  And, at the end of the day, $15 really isnt going to make a huge difference to struggling students. Naomi Riley, the recently   elected USAC president, admitted as much.  I ran Books For Bruins, and allocating $25 dollars wasnt enough, allocating $100 wasnt enough, Riley said. And we see with the CARES (Act) grant that students are saying $200 as a universal payment isnt enough.  Just like the recent stimulus checks some Americans received, a one-time payment might improve things for a short period of time, but that money will eventually run out sooner rather than later  especially when dealing with amounts as low as $15.  Yet, every dollar counts. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which has been used to grant students financial support to grapple with the fallout of the pandemic, doesn't  provide  money for undocumented or international students. These groups need actual financial support from USAC, not the chance to win a gift card.     Sure, its great that USAC reallocated this money and at least some students got something back. The council could easily have ignored the surplus and let the money go to waste or used it for a Zoom event the vast majority of students likely would not have attended.  But the money wasnt placed in the area where it could do the most good, and the student body suffered because of it.  The elections board couldve looked for a way around the restrictions on moving the money intended for campaigning efforts into the COVID-19 Relief Fund  thus returning money to students who actually need it. Instead, they found a way to use the money as a promotion for a measly 30% turnout.     The red tape involved in moving money around is absurd, and students should have a say in deciding what to do with surplus funds.  But until students get a greater voice in reallocation of student fees, Bruins will continue to feel slighted  and USAC will keep looking impractical.",['cap-mark-mcgreal'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.op_.mcgreal.USACelection.file_.jpg

Usually a day for celebrating the working class, Angelenos across the political spectrum criticized the institutional handling of the coronavirus pandemic for being either too much or too little.  At Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, about 70 nurses and other essential workers joined National Nurses United nurses at 138 hospitals across the country in demanding for better personal protective equipment. Teamsters Local 2010, which represents workers in higher education, also mourned an electrician who worked at the medical center but died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in late April.  Marcia Santini, a registered nurse in the Emergency Department, helped organize the protest at UCLA on behalf of the California Nurses Union. Santini questioned the safety of disinfecting N95 masks for reuse and said she believes the federal government should step in and produce more masks.  The intended use of an N95 mask is one mask per one patient for only a certain period of time or else it will start to break down, Santini said. The science behind sterilization has not convinced us that this is the right practice that should be in place. ... We would never ever do this on a normal day.  UCLA Health defended the practice of sterilizing N95 masks for reuse.  Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is a validated process used to kill viruses, said UCLA Health in an emailed statement. While UCLA Health has sufficient inventory to safely provide care during the pandemic, we recognize the importance of creative solutions to procure PPE supplies and extend their safe use.  Most demonstrators at UCLA dispersed after a series of speeches, but some continued with a car protest, showering the hospital staffs lunch break with a cacophony of car horns. Naghmeh Salami, a cytotechnologist in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the medical center, said she found the honking disrespectful.  I have a break and I have to hear this? said Salami, a member of the union University Professional and Technical Employees Communications Workers of America 9119. Protesting and asking for PPEs and standing up for your employees who have lost their lives, that's great. But this is not doing anything to help anyone, especially during this hard time.  In Central Los Angeles, dozens of protesters with the L.A. Tenants Union congregated in front of LA Mayor Eric Garcettis house to demand rent cancellation as the pandemic has pushed Angelenos out of work and unable to pay rent. A police line kept the crowd, both on foot and in cars, away from the house.  The protesters shouted, No rent, no evictions, no vacancies.  Both the city and county of LA currently have rent relief measures in place, while the state has a moratorium on evictions as well as Project Roomkey, a statewide initiative which has been providing shelter in vacant hotel rooms to those experiencing homelessness.  To that individual who is experiencing homeless who wants to go in: We have a room for you tonight, and we want to house you, Garcetti said in his daily press briefing on Friday. We want to make sure that anybody who is in danger of contracting COVID-19 knows that there is a place for them to put their head tonight.  However, Angelenos who dont pay rent now will have up to 12 months after the measures end to pay backlogged rent, while numerous hotels across the state have resisted from participating in Project Roomkey.  Mango Gwen, a fourth-year gender studies student at UCLA, joined the protest by Garcettis house. Gwen said they are seeking legal help against their landlord, who Gwen claims is trying to evict them despite a valid lease and the statewide moratorium.  Queer and trans students who have gone to UCLA to be safe from our families ... have to move back to them because of the crisis, said Gwen, who is transgender and lives off campus.  However, the shouting and honking at Garcettis house fell mostly on the wrong ears  although Amy Wakeland, Garcettis wife, was home at the time, Garcetti himself was preparing for his daily press briefing at City Hall.  Instead, City Hall saw an entirely different protest: Hundreds gathered to demand an immediate end to stay-at-home orders in California.  Multiple different crowds came to express their discontent: laborers asking to get back the jobs they lost because of the pandemic and right-wing activists denouncing Garcetti and California Gov. Gavin Newsom for their strict coronavirus containment measures. A few others present showed support for the stay-at-home orders.  However, unlike the previous drive-in protest at Civic Center on April 23, many protesters flaunted the governments social distancing and face-covering guidelines, tightly packing City Hall.  Many draped themselves in American flags and chanted, USA. Some carried signs supporting President Trump. Very few wore masks.  Similar May Day protests against Newsom occurred across California, notably at the state capitol in Sacramento where California Highway Patrol officers arrested 32 demonstrators. No protesters were arrested at City Hall, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.  Newsom announced at Fridays daily press briefing that California is days, not weeks away from gradually lifting restrictions, just as the protests were reaching their peaks around noon.  We're getting very close to making really meaningful augmentations to that stay-at-home order, said Newsom, hinting at new guidelines around protective equipment for the broader public.  Newsom announced Monday that California has contained the coronavirus pandemic well enough to start reopening some retail businesses beginning May 8.  However, Garcetti said lifting restrictions before the countywide safer-at-home order ends May 15 is unlikely since the number of COVID-19 patients in LA County continues to grow every week.  (If) the doors fly wide open, that would kill so many people in this county, Garcetti said. If we don't do this the right way, all the progress we fought for, all the time we spent at home would be for nothing.  Instead, the decision to reopen will be a dynamic one based on the current situation. In the meantime, Garcetti urged people to abide by public health guidelines, keep distance from others and wear face coverings as they protest.  It's not a mayor telling you to do these things, Garcetti said. It is a doctor telling you to do these things. These are medical professionals telling you you're putting yourself, your loved ones, anybody around you and strangers at risk.",['cap-jhan'],"['los-angeles', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.news_.COVIDmayday.JHan_-1.jpg

Second-year visual arts student Juan Hernandez creates art under the pseudonym Perry Picasshoe, a name that acts as an homage to renowned artist Pablo Picasso while playing on the term ""art hoe"" &#8211; someone who feigns an intense interest in art without knowing   anything aside from famous works. His current work in progress is   an oil painting that is a queer rendition of Sandro Botticelli's ""The Birth of Venus,"" using LGBTQ+ imagery such as pride flags. Picasshoe said he hopes to include this piece and others in an    LGBTQ+ inclusivity-focused art collection that he will develop over the summer.     &#8220;There&#8217;s two different ways to define queer art. The first is art made by queer folks, so it could just be any work, but the artist happens to be queer; and the other way of describing it is work that depicts queer culture,&#8221; Picasshoe said. &#8220;For my case, I'm doing both at the same time.&#8221;   [caption caption=""Picasshoe&#39;s current work in progress is a queer reinterpretation of Sandro Botticelli&#39;s &quot;The Birth of Venus.&quot; (Alex Driscoll/Daily Bruin)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385305"" width=""588""] [/caption]      By choosing a well-known work of art that depicts a heteronormative view of beauty, Picasshoe said   people&#8217;s preconceptions of beauty in the original work will carry over to his reimagination to show that queer love is equally as beautiful. The original painting depicts Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, in a giant seashell on the beach    surrounded by three angelic figures covered in drapes. Most of   this imagery,   including the massive shell and figures covered in drapes, will remain the same to capitalize on     the original themes of beauty, he said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping that (the piece) will show people that queer love is beautiful just as much as hetero (love), because we already have this interpretation of 'The Birth of Venus' as this beautiful thing,&#8221; Picasshoe said. &#8220;If it&#8217;s reinterpreted with queer folks, it will hold the same message but show it in a different light.&#8221;  Picasshoe plans to change the drapes to different LGBTQ+ flags, such as the rainbow pride flag. In doing so, Picasshoe said the celebration of queer love   will become more obvious to the viewer. Additionally, instead of a female depiction of Venus, Picasshoe said his version will   feature a male figure modeled after one of his close friends.   [Related:    Alumni will rewrite traditional LGBTQ narratives in Outfest short films   ]    While the focus of Picasshoe's work has now expanded to include queer   themes,   his close friend   Stephanie Ramirez said the focus of his work has changed over time. Having known each other since elementary school, Ramirez said she has seen Picasshoe&#8217;s work develop in conjunction with his journey to embrace his identity as a gay Chicano man.  Picasshoe&#8217;s art has shifted from studying other artists&#8217; techniques and compositions to beginning to develop his own style, Ramirez said. His paintings use bright, warm colors that evoke a sunset or sunrise. Picasshoe's content matter can be very direct &#8211; like   showing queer couples kissing &#8211; but Ramirez said regardless of the content matter, his use of warm colors creates aesthetically pleasing images.     &#8220;(Picasshoe) started drawing more detailed pictures of men and the beauty of men &#8211; these couples kissing in these pictures, women kissing each other, men kissing each other,&#8221;   Ramirez said. &#8220; It was not in a very cheap way &#8211; it was very beautifully done and it was amazing to see because he was speaking to (his friends) through art.&#8221;     [Related:    QueerCurrent speaker to explore impact of LGBTQ+, minority models on industry   ]    Another painting Picasshoe hopes to include in his exhibit depicts two male   faces, each painted on a drum head. The painting, &#8220;Untitled: Perfect Lovers,&#8221; was inspired by Felix Gonzalez-Torres&#8217; work of two synchronized clocks called &#8220;&#8216;Untitled&#8217; (Perfect Lovers).&#8221; Building on the original work, Picasshoe said his version on drum heads is meant to imply at first that the lovers portrayed have hearts beating in perfect harmony. However, he said one of the drum heads is torn to suggest that the lovers&#8217; hearts are not beating at the same pace because of widespread anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments.  &#8220;At the time when I made it, gay marriage was just being legalized,"" Picasshoe said. ""So during that time, their love &#8211; queer love &#8211; wasn't accepted as it should have (been).&#8221;  Picasshoe's art changed with   his own self-acceptance, Martin Perez said. As a close friend of Picasshoe's and a fellow artist, Perez characterizes Picasshoe&#8217;s work as   free, pushing back against traditional rules through techniques like finger painting. In particular, one of Picasshoe's paintings, a man wearing a pink cowboy hat with sunflowers over his face, evokes a sense of serenity in the act of simply being, Perez said. Through pieces like these, Perez said   Picasshoe's own journey to accepting his identity became evident.  &#8220;(Before coming out as gay, Picasshoe) was kind of caged in and he was using art to break through,"" Perez said. ""Once he did break through, he became just like this flower that blossomed.&#8221;   [caption caption=""Many of Picasshoe&#39;s pieces, like his piece titled &quot;Poolside Love,&quot; depict various forms of queer love to resonate with the LGBTQ+ community.

By using themes of love and acceptance, Picasshoe said he is creating art that he and other members of the LGBTQ+ community can identify with.   &#8220;I'm hoping that people in the (LGBTQ+) community find comfort in   (my work), that they feel like they&#8217;re included, that they have representation and relatability,"" Picasshoe said.

The event, which took place Saturday on Zoom, united over 300 dancers on the virtual platform for four hours. Balancing educational content with bursts of upbeat activities like a drag performance, the annual event preserved its aim to illuminate the stories of those affected by HIV/AIDS and bring awareness to the cause. The Pediatric AIDS Coalition at UCLA, which hosts the event, hoped to highlight the commonalities of HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 by showing how these conditions are exacerbated by each other, said PAC president and fourth-year neuroscience and Spanish student Sophie Ahmad.  We want to talk about how it intersects with COVID-19 just because they are similar in their history, the stigma surrounding people and the fear that broke out when this unknown infection was spreading around, Ahmad said.  The gathering began with opening statements from Ahmad detailing Dance Marathons goal of defeating the stigma against HIV/AIDS. Decked in PACs bright yellow Unite T-shirt, the organizations president introduced the a cappella group Medleys A Cappella to sing the national anthem. Then, with a screen split into a multitude of windows, viewers could see each of the singer's faces as they sang a rendition of John Lennon's ""Imagine.""  Transitioning from song to dance, PACs leadership urged the audience to join them in the 2020 morale dance, traditionally taught at the beginning of every Dance Marathon. This years morale dance drew inspiration from daily life in quarantine, with moves inspired by mundane tasks like washing your feet or taking cereal off the shelf. Accentuated by quick shoulder shimmies and hip twirls, the morale dance was set to Diana Rosss disco classic Im Coming Out and was repeated three times throughout the event.  After the morale dance portion, PACs leaders introduced the team captains and their colors      ranging from a tie-dyed orange shirt to green gym shorts  followed by speaker Ben Banks and his experience with pediatric HIV/AIDS. After Banks story concluded, the cause education committee gave an educational presentation touching upon HIV/AIDS myths and the effects its stigma leaves upon those with it. One member of the committee, second-year microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics student Sam Joslyn, discussed the impact of stigma in relation to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, including the physical assault of an Asian man in London.  The effect of this stigma is in all aspects of life, Joslyn said. Theres been a rise in verbal and physical hate crimes all around the world, and this type of scapegoating has a long history.  After taking questions about the presentation from the audience, the event transitioned into a performance by drag queen Lorelai. Strutting to Billie Eilishs bad guy in a skintight velvet suit and coiffed mustache, Lorelai used the online platform to her advantage by utilizing a split-screen to project two versions of herself at once. Once the drag queen walked off the screen, PAC leaders facilitated the morale dance once again before beginning the events vigil to honor those with HIV/AIDS.  During the vigil, several UCLA-affiliated musicians performed, including Izzy Escobar, Mad, Akshay Anand, Shivan, Dark Dazey and Taxi. Escobar, lit by a hazy pink rose projected onto her, performed a song of hope that described how the light always comes when you stop looking.  Mad followed with a stripped-down ukulele song about the idealism of youth and teenage cliches, while Anand sang maybe Ive been alone too long, drawing attention to the looming uncertainty of the current climate. Later, former Spring Sing contestants Dark Dazey and Taxi lightened the mood with upbeat, rock-infused dance tracks, while Shivan looped his guitar for a Michael Jackson cover.  Interspersed between musical performances, representatives from beneficiaries like Camp Laurel spoke about their experiences with HIV/AIDS. Alumna Kelly Gluckman discussed her experience contracting the virus from her boyfriend, touching upon the utility of poetry and creative writing as an outlet to express her feelings. Others spoke about their experiences at Camp Laurel as counselors finding a sense of community for the first time.  After the live speakers concluded, Appurva Goel, PAC's executive director of outreach and fourth-year economics and communication student, asked the participants to join another bout of random dancing before announcing how much had been fundraised. The grand total was $143,288.59   and served as a representation of the communitys dedication to bringing   awareness to HIV/AIDS, particularly in the uncertainty of todays climate, Goel said.  A movement is not constructed of figures and facts, but people willing to take a stand against injustice and suffering, Goel said.",['cap-kaia-sherry'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/breaking.dancemarathon-1.jpg

Behind every copy placed on newsstands and every story published online, lies the journalistic process of hundreds of hard-working contributors, staffers and editors. Every day, important decisions are made to determine what is reported, how the reporting happens and in what ways we can best serve our readers. This is Behind The Bruin.    The 2019-2020 Online editor Thomas Gerard and Digital Managing editor Kristie-Valerie Hoang unveil the process behind re-designing the main site.   Were wrapping up the current academic year and our jobs at the Daily Bruin, but we couldnt leave without a grand finale: the launch of our re-designed website.  Built on Next.js, a lightweight framework for React.js, and a flexible application programming interface-powered backend, our new website is designed from the ground up to provide a more digital-forward experience to our millions of online readers.  One of our main goals was to provide readers with a platform that highlights the best of our digital journalism  the photos, videos, graphics and illustrations accompanying written content. We also wanted to solidify the Daily Bruin brand through standardized typography and colors to create a cohesive design language across our social media platforms and website so readers instantly know theyre looking at content produced by The Bruin.  Over the years, weve shifted our production efforts to an online focus, emphasizing reader interactivity beyond the physical print paper. This year alone, weve launched many online-exclusive projects, which have allowed readers to take a deeper part in both  understanding  the issues at hand, and the  storytelling  itself.  Importantly, this spring also marks the first time the Daily Bruin has published solely on digital platforms as the paper temporarily halted printing in mid-March. Since the suspension of print production, the re-design was all the more imperative because the website became the one and only home of The Bruin. In this age of online-only journalism, we felt it was necessary to have a framework that supports the content we produce and engages users on our site.   [Related:    Letter from the editors: Daily Bruin will cease printing and move online for the rest of the academic year   ]    This website re-design is a project nearly three years in the making. Together designers, coders and content editors within Daily Bruin workshopped layouts for every part of the website from the homepage to individual articles. After these mockups were created, upgrading the sites architecture alone took more than six months. When that was complete, the site was internally launched to the staff for initial reactions before a soft release to the public for additional testing. Through our online form, weve received a wide range of feedback from people all over the UCLA community including students, alumni and even a couple Daily Bruin veterans.  However, this isnt the first makeover the Daily Bruin main site has received  this is actually the websites sixth re-design since its initial launch in the 1990s.  [caption id=""attachment_385023"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    The Daily Bruin homepage has undergone several design changes since the website launched in 1994. Photo credit: Thomas Gerard[/caption]  In its inception, Daily Bruins first online operations were written in plain HTML but quickly progressed to include images and custom styling. In January 2012, Daily Bruin launched  M  ojo   short for mobile journalism  a site specifically designed to match the on-the-go nature of digital news consumption in the age of smartphones. With our re-design, we wanted to revive Mojos mission to provide a great reading experience on mobile devices, as now more than 60% of the papers online users visit the site using a phone or tablet.  Aside from a clean, modern look, the re-design introduces several new features to create a more engaging browsing experience  including an integrated Twitter feed, infinite scrolling pages and responsive multimedia galleries. And by using a technology stack in-line with the rest of the newsrooms digital projects, were able to integrate unique and engaging layouts into our regular production cycle as seen in our  ""  Columns from Quarantine"" series  and  2019-2020 USAC Officer Evaluations  pages.

For the majority of incoming and current Bruins, COVID-19 means a shortened in-person school year. However, international students are managing varying levels of online learning and government restrictions depending on the country they live in.  ""During normal times,  F-1 students are limited in the number of remote learning course credits they can count toward their full-time enrollment, which is required to maintain their F-1 status,"" said Sam Nahidi, director of the UCLA Dashew Center for International Students, in an emailed statement.  The United States Department of Homeland Security temporarily allowed F-1 students to count all remote classes toward their full-time enrollment for visa status purposes, Nahidi said.  &#8220;There is a possibility that this temporary provision may continue,&#8221; he added.   The transition to university for incoming international students may prove to be tricky despite having experience with online learning, said Neha Bhagat, an incoming first-year neuroscience student who took online classes for the last few months of high school.  &#8220;Learning to enroll in classes is pretty difficult as it is, and then having to take those classes again would be something else,&#8221; said Bhagat, who lives in Zimbabwe. &#8220;As an international student, (another problem) would be the time differences and having to get up at midnight to take a class.&#8221;  UCLA has not announced fall instruction plans, but the Dashew Center will advise newly admitted students on how to proceed based on accommodations made by the university and U.S. immigration agencies, Nahidi said.   The university has stated that it will offer the option of remote learning for students, both domestic and international, who are unable to safely arrive on campus in the fall, he said. International students who opt for remote learning fall quarter will be able to attend classes remotely without establishing their F-1 status, Nahidi added.   Administrative conversations   After he returned home to Bangladesh, Jibran Ali, a third-year financial actuarial mathematics student, requested a new I-20 form since his old one nearly expired. An I-20 proves that F-1 student visa holders are legally enrolled in a program to study in the U.S.  Although the Dashew Center&#8217;s processing time is normally around 15 days, they processed his request and shipped him an I-20 in two days, he said.  &#8220;I kind of appreciated that from them, I understand that this is a challenging time for everybody,&#8221; Ali said.   While he is not worried about the legalities of returning to UCLA in the fall, Ali said he is concerned about the logistics given the uncertainty of flights and travel restrictions.   Gigi Thein, a second-year biology student from Thailand, said she was considering taking fall quarter off and contacted the center regarding how to proceed. The staff member gave adequate guidance and sent her the required documents to begin the process, she said.  However, students who take one or more quarters off will not be able to maintain their F-1 status, since full-time enrollment is required, Nahidi said.   The loss of an F-1 status can impact an international student's eligibility for employment or internships in the U.S. through the Curricular Practical Training and Optional Practical Training programs because both programs require a year of full-time enrollment before students can apply, he added.    These programs allow international students to gain experience for their major of study through employment or internships. CPT must occur during the student&#8217;s course of study while OPT can be done any time before or after graduation.  Incoming international first-year students are also having difficulty meeting visa and enrollment requirements at this time.  Meha Mukherjee, an incoming first-year pre-economics student, said she managed to request and fill out the documents necessary to begin applying for her visa from the Dashew Center in late April.  However, Mukherjee said by the time she was able to schedule her visa appointment with the American embassy in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where she lives, the embassy closed because of COVID-19.  Nishka Laungani, an incoming first-year psychobiology student from Hong Kong, said she does not feel comfortable going to a hospital to get the immunizations required to attend UCLA because of the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  Although current guidance from the federal government allows students with F-1 visas to maintain their status with full-time enrollment in online classes, this could change because of the pandemic&#8217;s unpredictable nature, said Sarah McBride, a UC spokesperson, in an emailed statement.  To address this, UC President Janet Napolitano and the UC&#8217;s 10 chancellors wrote to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf on May 18 to request that international students applying to travel to and those currently in the U.S. are not affected by future governmental decisions.  &#8220;We ask you to ensure that non-immigrant visas relating to study or research at institutions of higher education are not affected by future executive action and that visa interviews continue to be scheduled and conducted remotely, well in advance of the start date of these students&#8217; programs to allow them to travel and begin their study on time,&#8221; the letter stated.   Napolitano and the chancellors also wrote that ensuring students who are currently abroad are still able to apply for OPT is important, as many international students have returned home.  The Dashew Center is continuing to process all visa-related requests, including those for OPT, Nahidi added.   Summer, fall and beyond   UCLA is allowing students whose families have been directly impacted by COVID-19 to defer admission, said Gary Clark, director of Undergraduate Admissions, in an emailed statement.  Sydney Stuckmann, an incoming first-year pre-global studies student, said she would not want to defer a quarter, as she graduated high school in November. Stuckmann, who lives in Sydney, Australia, is prepared for both off-campus or on-campus instruction, although the latter seems very unlikely, she said.  Thein said she is considering taking more than one quarter off.  &#8220;My friends did suggest (that) maybe we should take the two quarters off and try to do a program in a Thai university,&#8221; Thein said. &#8220;So at least (we) wouldn't have to fly back because we're very worried about all the flying and the (United) States opening up.&#8221;  When it comes to internships and future employment, no international student is alone in the challenges they&#8217;re facing, Ali said.  Ali&#8217;s internship wants him in the U.S. by June 15, but with the Bangladesh airport closed, that doesn&#8217;t seem like a possibility, he added.   ""In the case that I lose this, which is looking more and more likely, I'm going to have to re-recruit in the fall,&#8221; Ali said. &#8220;Doing so as an international kid in these economic circumstances is going to be really, really challenging.&#8221;   If he loses the offer and is unable to re-recruit in the fall, Ali said he will look for opportunities outside of the U.S.  &#8220;When you're an international (student), the world's kind of your oyster,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's not necessary that we stay (in the U.S.) to work. Why not Hong Kong? Why not go to the Middle East? Why not go to Singapore? Why not go to Europe? You know, because you've already done it (for university), we can do it again.&#8221;   Contributing reports by Olivia Tran, Daily Bruin contributor.

These days, South Campus students really cant catch a break, and their departments certainly arent making it any easier.  With Bruins scattered across corners of the globe having to deal with personal and financial insecurities on their own, many departments rightly decided to take one burden off their students shoulders through pass/no pass grading. Some of the most rigorous departments, however, are behind the curve.  Under the current system, students taking classes for letter grades in the three departments still  holding out   physics and astronomy, mathematics and economics  are at a comparative disadvantage. The former departments have not allowed any pass/no pass classes to be taken for major requirements, while the economics department has only allowed some major requirements be taken pass no pass. Unlike the vast majority of departments on campus, these stragglers force rigid letter grading onto students who, more than ever, require flexibility.  And if departments cant take responsibility for their students well-being, its time a higher authority steps in.  UCLA and the Academic Senate must take a heavier hand in standardizing a pass/no pass approach across all departments. In leaving these decisions up to individual departments, UCLA is doing a disservice to the equity of education, as well as individual students who are already navigating challenging classes and denied a grading safety net.  Unsurprisingly, this inconsistent approach isnt anything new. From its  response  to the Getty fire to its  decisions  about finals during week 10 of winter quarter, UCLA has a history of coming up with disjointed, uncertain strategies to help students during times of crisis.  And it must reverse this dangerous trend.  Because one only needs to examine the quality of education a student receives from Zoom University to understand why a pass/no pass grading option is a must-have.  Lackluster engagement, limited opportunities to ask questions, technical difficulties and more prevent students from performing to the best of their ability. This is a shortcoming of the system, not of the student. The decision to maintain a facade of normality in grading unjustly faults students for circumstances outside of their control.  We are currently in a moment that demands clear messaging and fair accommodations. And that means university leadership must ensure that departments lend students a hand, rather than kick them when theyre down.  Its true that some of these departments uphold high selectivity in their fields. With longevity in mind, maintaining letter grades could help students back onto regularized tracks a few months or years down the road.  But this train of thought is deeply flawed.  First, plenty of selective departments are finding workarounds through these difficult times. For example, the communication major is a small and application-based major  yet, the communication department is allowing the pass/no pass grading option for major requirements after receiving student concerns.  Second, and more importantly, theres a stark chance that not every student will be able to hang on a few more months without accommodation.  Dropouts are on the rise , and many students are grappling with the greatest economic downturn and public health emergency in decades.  The push to make pass/no pass grading available to students should not end as the school year comes to an end, but should be universally offered through the duration of online classes  however long that may be.  Pass/no pass grades are little more than an inconvenience for administrators, but a potential lifesaver for students.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/edi-10.png

Then I was hit with that little reminder  Wait a minute, were in a pandemic  and I realized that I might have some more thinking to do before clicking ""confirm purchase.""  Online shopping has been a saving grace for many during this pandemic, allowing folks to purchase necessities without leaving the house. Data from the  Adobe Digital Economy Index  shows us that e-commerce levels from March 13-15   increased by 25% compared to a baseline from the beginning of the month  with grocery sales making up a bulk of this growth.  While the online purchase of groceries and other essential items are certainly on the rise, these are not the only type of goods people have been clicking on. People across the country  including UCLA students  are buying plenty of nonessential items, too. The Quad is exploring this type of nonessential online shopping and looking into how Bruins are spending their time and money on the web during this pandemic.   [Related:    UCLA student co-founds online secondhand clothing store with brother   ]   As you might expect, brick-and-mortar retailers selling nonessentials have been hit hard by mandated closures. But that  doesn't mean  their online platforms are suffering.  According to  Forbes , many direct-to-consumer brands  brands that   cut out traditional retailers from the buying and selling process      have seen nonessential item sales soar during the months of March and April as compared to past years. Sales of home goods, loungewear and athletic wear in particular have seen huge spikes.  In the midst of a global health crisis, buying succulents or fairy lights for your room might seem pretty low on the list of priorities, but that hasnt stopped people from doing so anyway.  Twitter user @talliesinyoung may have gone viral when she  tweeted  I will single handedly save our economy through online shopping. dont worry guys, but students like first-year Vanessa Gonzalez have put this promise into practice.  For this biology student, online shopping has become a regular part of her shelter-in-place lifestyle.  Being stuck at home and having nothing else to do and ... having that take a toll on me not being able to socialize, Im just kind of click, click and then I buy more, Gonzalez said.  In the past month, Gonzalezs purchases have spanned from dresses and shirts to gel pens and color-changing   lights that   she saw on TikTok. She said her online shopping habit has become a way to cope with recent stress in her life.  I usually do a lot of retail therapy whenever Im in a little pit where I dont know what else to do, she said. And this has been an insane amount of online shopping compared to what I usually do.  At a time when a contagious virus is spreading rapidly on a global scale, its safe to say that Gonzalez is not the only one experiencing elevated stress levels. Shes also not alone in her method of dealing with it.  Though retail therapy may be a strain on the wallet, research has proven that shopping does help people deal with distressing situations. A  study  published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology found that making shopping choices can help reduce residual sadness and increase a sense of personal control over one's environment.  Thus, because shopping provides a way to regain a sense of control, it makes sense that we might see increases in online purchases during this otherwise uncontrollable time. After all, individual Americans cant do much to mitigate the crisis  aside from staying at home  but they may have more control over the items they put in their own kitchens and closets.  Moreover, according to clinical psychologist Scott Bea, this empowerment through purchasing might not be a bad coping mechanism, if handled responsibly.  If you plan it out and say Im going to save for this or Im going to reward myself and accumulate those funds to do a little retail therapy, then that can feel really, really good, he told the  Cleveland Clinic.   As long as you keep track of your finances, purchasing that rock lamp might not be too bad for your wallet and may also be a much-needed mood boost. But before you decide to redecorate your whole room, remember that there is a difference between a little retail therapy and shopping enough to ""single handedly save our economy.""  This sentiment may seem like yet another reason to throw in matching rugs and pillows, but it is a justification that is easily debunked.     Jerry Nickelsburg, an adjunct UCLA professor of economics and director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, said individual efforts are ineffective in a recession this widespread.  When you have a national recession in an economy as large as ours, no one persons spending is going to move the needle, Nickelsburg said.  While it's pretty evident that our individual spending cant resolve the economic crisis at hand, what remains unknown is how other systems can be affected by our online purchases during this pandemic. Specifically, what happens to the delivery systems in place when so many Americans decide to shop   online more than ever before?  Amazon  announced  that as of March 17, they will be prioritizing the delivery of essential goods because of the large influx of online orders. As a result, they said that delivery guarantees would be longer than usual.    Amazon is not the only company that has had to allow for a little wiggle room in delivery time. Many online retailers are adding messages to their sites explaining potential delayed shipping as a result of the pandemic.  Digital marketing expert Tony Verre told Marketing Land, a marketing news platform, that he predicts the massive amount of online ordering will cause delivery windows for most companies to stretch to five-to-seven day windows instead of the one-to-two day windows popularized by Amazon Prime.  Vanessa Van, a third-year sociology student, said she has experienced shipping delays ordering hair care products online and has had trouble finding what she wants.  Its kind of hard because I really want to buy something but sometimes it's out of stock, Van said. Its because everyones online shopping. Everyones at home doing nothing.  With so much demand causing a strain on delivery infrastructure, it might seem prudent to skip on the   cute new boots for the foreseeable future. After all, they are certainly less important than someone receiving their medication or even their shampoo or body wash in the mail.  On the other hand, though, it's possible that retailers have already found one way to allow customers to continue purchasing nonessential items without interfering too much with critical deliveries.  On its COVID-19  response blog , Amazon encourages customers to select the No-Rush Shipping option when ordering non-essential items, stating that it will help them to prioritize customers with critical needs first and to consolidate orders for fewer neighborhood stops.  Therefore, if you already know that your gel pens are a nonnegotiable purchase, consider selecting a slower shipment option to help delivery services ship when it's most efficient.  For Bruins who still have reservations about their nonessential purchases, there are several measures that can also be taken to help others while you spend. Options include shopping  local businesses  or buying brands that have pledged to  support pandemic-related  causes.  Regardless of the shopping choices you have made since the emergence of COVID-19, it seems that the pandemic is leaving a permanent mark on how we conduct our purchases. In fact, our current situation may be ushering in a new age of shopping.  The American economy will be more characterized by online shopping than it was before, Nickelsburg said. We were headed in that direction anyway, but its been accelerated by the pandemic.  People love shopping, and with the pre-pandemic world already becoming increasingly digital, that love doesn't have to end, even with the onslaught of a contagious viral disease.     Today's world holds its fair share of challenges, and online shopping has become something of an unlikely hero for those who have the means to do it. It's given us a way to safely take care of essential needs as well as the not-so-essential ones  like chunky black boots for 50% off.  If you couldn't tell by this point, I bought the boots.",['cap-olivia-fitzmorris'],"['campus-quad', 'lifestyle-quad', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Nghi-Nguyen.png

The Netflix original, written and directed by Alan Yang, f  ollows Pin-Jui (Hong-Chi Lee), an ambitious young Taiwanese man who fulfills his dream of going to America through an arranged marriage to Zhenzhen (Kunjue Li), even if it means leaving behind the woman he loves. As an older man going by the name Grover (Tzi Ma), he reflects on his past as he attempts to mend his relationship with his daughter Angela (Christine Ko). As   Yang's directorial debut, ""Tigertail""   offers an emotionally rich, heartbreaking look at the impact of immigration as well as cultural and generational divides.   [Related:    Festival films contemplate rapidly changing nature of Taiwans culture, society   ]   Told through time jumps between Pin-Jui's past and present, some of the story's suspense is eliminated for the sake of style. The jumps disclose early on plot points such as Pin-Jui's abandonment of the woman he loves in Taiwan as well as his later divorce from Zhenzhen.  However, the dual narratives beautifully juxtapose Pin-Juis early   life and his later   emotional state, clarifying the toll brought on by leaving behind both the people he loved as well as the pain in knowing that so many immigration stories go untold. The connection between the two narratives is essential to understand why emotional openness is so difficult for him, making   his stern character a little more sympathetic.  The film is also able to emotionally match the performances of the younger and older versions of the characters  none more successfully than Zhenzhen. The young Zhenzhen starts out as a seemingly naive, simplistic housewife, but Li is able to root her performance   in her character's growing aspiration   for a better life. Lis interpretation of the character is later matched by Fiona Fu, who plays the part of the older Zhenzhen with warmth and strength. Fu shines with quiet power and resolve when Zhenzhen finally tells Grover she wants a divorce, doing justice to the seeds of determination sown   in Li's performance earlier in the film.    At the narrative   heart of the film, however, is Mas portrayal of Grover, which is moving in its simplicity. Ma is able to impart so much emotion through his eyes, giving depth to a man who often says very little.  In a lesser actors hands, Grover could be an incredibly unsympathetic patriarch, but Ma is able to portray the weight of his pain and make Grovers fraught relationships more relatable. In many of the tense conversations with Angela, Ma makes Grovers discomfort and uncertainty palpable, while also conveying Grovers desire to connect with his daughter. Even as Grover constantly makes mistakes and repeatedly says the wrong thing, its hard not to root for him.   [Related:    Movie review: Cultural authenticity in Always Be My Maybe spices up rom-com genre   ]   To effectively demonstrate Grover's splintered relationships in a beautiful and subtle way, the film uses silence and omission to elevate the emotion and meaning of scenes with minimal dialogue. When Angela asks Grover about his trip back to Taiwan for his mothers funeral, the strained pauses and loaded glances reveal more about their history than any dialogue could. At times, this makes the film feel cold, but it serves to contrast with the brief moments of warmth throughout the film   when two characters do manage to connect.    Though the story of father and daughter is a fictional one, Yang said in an interview with NBC News that part of the filmmaking   process involved developing a better understanding of his parents' stories and humanizing them  a personal touch that is apparent in the film. Yang takes great care to add dimension to the elements of a familiar family drama, while also exploring the nuances of arranged marriage that are rarely portrayed in American films. After years of minimal, marginal Asian representation in film, Tigertail tells a story that hasnt been portrayed in mainstream American cinema.  A moving portrait of the complexities of family and the multi-generational impact of immigration, ""Tigertail"" is imbued with palpable authenticity and love.",['cap-olivia-mazzucato'],"['arts-entertainment', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/Tigertail_Unit_10125.jpg

Jarrett Stidham and Brian Hoyer are the two quarterbacks left on New Englands roster with Brady now in Tampa Bay.

Patriots director of player personnel Nick Caserio said in a post-draft press conference that UCLA coach Chip Kelly was a good resource in helping New England scout and eventually settle on picking Asiasi.

The first testimony comes from UCLA indoor and beach volleyball senior Savvy Simo, who has recently announced she will take a fifth year in response to the cancellation of what would have been her eighth campaign as a Bruin.   Going into my senior beach season, I was the happiest and most content with myself I have ever been.  I had struggled with anxiety in years past, and it made me question myself and the sport I loved. With the help of others, I overcame that and found myself again in my final indoor and beach volleyball seasons.  This beach season was going to mean so much to me because it was the last season I would ever get to compete in a UCLA jersey.  Unfortunately, my senior year got cut short due to circumstances completely out of my control. It was heartbreaking, not only for me but for my teammates and every other athlete competing across the country.  These last few weeks without my school, my teammates and volleyball have been some of the hardest times I have ever been through.  Still, looking back at my three and a half years at UCLA, I could not be more thankful for the experiences that I was able to have.  Not everyone can say they played in Pauley Pavilion. Not everyone can say they have met professional athletes such as Lebron James and Kevin Durant just because they trained in the same practice gym.  Not everyone can say they are friends with Lonzo Ball, TJ Leaf, Josh Rosen, Kyla Ross, Madison Kocian and many others who have gone on to compete at the professional level or in the Olympics.  Not everyone can say they won back-to-back national championships with the most amazing and talented girls in the world. Not everyone can say they have been coached by some of the best to ever play the game.  And lastly, not everyone has had the privilege to play with those four letters across their chest. There is nothing like being a Bruin, and nothing will ever compare.  UCLA was always my dream school. I remember wanting to go here ever since I started thinking about college. When I went on my visit, I knew right then that it was the place for me  the campus was beautiful, the people were amazing, it was the No. 1 public university in the world and a place with the slogan Champions Made Here.  Although I was able to attend my dream school, the journey was never as easy as many might think. I faced a lot of adversity during my time at UCLA.  But I have always been able to get through it because of where I was and the people I was surrounded by. I was never alone, I was never disregarded and I was never given up on.  There are always going to be things and people that will try to bring you down, but because of UCLA, I was able to meet those who will bring me back up and support me all the way.  Right now is no different.  With everything going on in the world right now, I continue to rely on my UCLA support system  which is why I plan on making use of my NCAA-granted additional collegiate eligibility.  I can find comfort in knowing I have the opportunity to go back to UCLA and compete alongside my best friends and a coaching staff that supports me and the team more than anything.  I look forward to getting the chance to play with my best friends at Mapes Beach for one final ride. Everything happens for a reason, and the Bruins will be back.  Once a Bruin, always a Bruin.

Since then, the project has grown and received positive feedback from judges using the data to rule on related cases, said Keegan Hawkins, Dolovichs research assistant and School of Law graduate student.  The initiative includes a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data gathered and managed by collaborators across the country who are tracking daily court orders, prison conditions, visitation policy changes, and confirmed COVID-19 cases and related deaths in prisons by state.  Aaron Littman, the deputy director of the project and Binder Clinical Teaching Fellow at UCLA School of Law, said an exhaustive spreadsheet such as this serves as a cross-fertilizing tool and resource for those currently advocating for and deciding upon the rights of people in prison or jail in the wake of COVID-19.  Hundreds of advocates, lawyers, government officials and judges have been contacting us, Littman said. Requests were coming in from judges around the country who said theyre being confronted with emergency motions and that they needed to know what other courts are doing.  The project is driven by the belief that a dramatic reduction of the jail population is paramount for public health, Littman said.  Littman said most prisoners do not pose a significant risk to public safety and therefore the public should not be disturbed with decarceration but rather with incarceration.  Mass incarceration is a disease that kills people too, Littman said.  A new report released by the American Civil Liberties Union suggests that a failure to consider inmates during the COVID-19 response would  double  the number of originally predicted national coronavirus-related deaths.  Additionally, the report highlights that incarceration facilities are connected with the outside community. With people such as correctional staff and lawyers frequenting in and out of facilities, the report argues there is a clear linkage between the two communities: A spread in one would lead to a spread in the other.  That connection to outside communities and the viral-conducive nature of overcrowded incarceration facilities, where social distancing is nonviable and access to hygiene is largely absent, can produce fatal repercussions, according to the report.  Those (incarcerated) in the jail are forced to live in crowded dorms and cells, are not given adequate supplies of soap, masks, and other protective equipment necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19, and are forced to live in conditions that foster the easy transmission of the virus, said Eric Balaban, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU National Prison Project, in an emailed statement.  As of April 29, there has been one coronavirus-related death of a person incarcerated in California state facilities and at least 214 coronavirus cases. In Los Angeles County jails, at least 68 people in prisons and jails have tested positive with numbers continuing to climb. No deaths have been reported yet.  The issue here isnt that we need to build more facilities to incarcerate people, Littman said. We need to incarcerate fewer people like virtually any developed country.  Among developed nations, the United States is an anomaly in its implementation of mass incarceration, according to  data  from the Vera Institute of Justice, an organization that partners with government officials to improve the justice system.  The U.S. incarceration rate was almost seven times higher than that of other developed countries before the pandemic, and LA Countys rate was more than triple the international average, according to the data. For LA County to meet global standards, its jail population would have to decrease from the current estimate of 11,865 inmates to about 3,500.  Good steps have been made in the right direction, but not nearly enough has been done, Littman said.  LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva has released 25% of the countys incarcerated population, whom he described as all the low-hanging fruit during a press conference on April 14. Essentially, these are nonviolent inmates, ones that Villanueva deemed nonthreatening to public safety.  Villanueva said there is little prospect of more releases, indicating that the overwhelming majority of the remaining people in prisons and jails have committed violent offenses and will not be released.  Ralph Diaz, Secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, has also released 3,585 inmates from Californias state facilities as of April 14.  Though Californias prison system as a whole is within the Supreme Court-mandated 137.5% population limit, 12 out of 35 of its individual facilities are still operating above that percentage as of April 22, according to  CDCRs weekly population reports .  The reductions in the jails population are not nearly enough to allow the remaining thousands of people who remain jailed to practice social distancing that the CDC has called a cornerstone to prevent transmission of the virus, Balaban said.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom paused the intake and transfer of inmates into state prisons for 30 days, among other measures, in an executive  order  on March 24.  Attorneys for people in prisons and jails who found Newsoms executive order insufficient filed an  emergency motion  to the federal courts asking CDCR to release certain prisoners who are deemed high-risk to COVID-19, including those aged 65 and over and those with chronic heart and lung diseases.  The emergency motion was ultimately  denied  by a district judge on April 17. The decision effectively halted further decarceration of state prisons.  Its very clear that there is a substantial risk of serious harm to people living in these settings, especially those who are at high risk and have a substantial chance of needing critical care, Littman said. Jail officials know it, and theyre not doing nearly enough about it.  Littman added he thinks living with the coronavirus in incarceration facilities is like an undue death penalty.  The vast majority of these people were not sentenced to death, and those who were sentenced to death were not sentenced to death from the coronavirus, Littman said. Theyre at real risk of that happening.",['cap-hyeyoon-alyssa-choi'],"['campus', 'los-angeles', 'national', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.incarcerationdatabase.TS_.jpg

Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos initially proposed the rules in November 2018. The proposals were met with nationwide criticism, which the Department of Education says it took under consideration when creating the final rules.  Under the finalized rules, released May 6, colleges will be required to hold live hearings that allow both parties to be cross-examined. In the past, neither cross-examinations nor live hearings were mandatory.  Additionally, the rules significantly reduce the number of &#8220;mandatory reporters&#8221; of sexual misconduct. Previously, community members such as athletic coaches, residential assistants and faculty were required to report sexual misconduct if they learned of it. Now, individual institutions decide who is obligated to report.   [Related link:    University of California officials discuss effects of proposed Title IX changes   ]   UC President Janet Napolitano said in a  statement  that while some of the changes are welcome, such as the inclusion of relationship violence in Title IX violations, many of the rules are not compassionate toward accusers. Napolitano specifically cited the new rules which narrow the definition of sexual harassment and allow for cross-examination of accusers.  Universities must comply with the new rules by Aug. 14. Napolitano said the Department of Education&#8217;s deadline to implement the changes is challenging, especially since the administration has limited ability to meet with community members because of COVID-19.  In a letter to campus Title IX officers, Suzanne Taylor, the systemwide Title IX director, said the UC will support potential lawsuits against the rules that may stop or delay them from being implemented.  Taylor also said the Department of Education ignored input from the UC, Title IX professionals and students.  She added that they met with the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and the federal Office of Management and Budget to discuss many of the changes.  The Systemwide Title IX Office oversees the education of Title IX staff at each campus and implementation of new policies, such as the recent federal rule changes.  The UC Title IX Student Advisory Board, which consists of student representatives from each campus, will be meeting with Taylor at the end of the month to discuss how the UC system will comply with the new rules, multiple representatives said.  Katarina Gustin, UC San Diego&#8217;s undergraduate student representative, said the current student advisory board has been expecting the Title IX changes to be released during this school year, so representatives are prepared to give feedback based on the climate of the student body on the individual campuses.  At UCLA, Chancellor Gene Block sent an email to all students when the changes were announced, reaffirming the school&#8217;s commitment to all students involved in investigations and directing students to resources such as Campus Assault Resources and Education and Student Legal Services.  &#8220;Please be assured that (the changes) will not curtail UCLA&#8217;s efforts to support and maintain a community where everyone can work, live and learn in an environment free of all forms of sex discrimination, including sexual violence and harassment,&#8221; said Block in his email. &#8220;UCLA remains dedicated to ensuring that our policies and procedures protect the rights and welfare of all parties involved in Title IX processes.&#8221;  Millen Srivastava, the founder and executive director of the UC Womxn&#8217;s Leadership Conference and the outgoing Financial Supports commissioner, said Block&#8217;s email was reassuring.  &#8220;I was proud that the day of the new rules being announced, Chancellor Block sent out a campuswide email with a commitment to combating sexual harassment and violence,&#8221; said the fourth-year biology and political science student.  Srivastava added the chancellor&#8217;s quick reaction is a testament to the passion and care UCLA students have for protecting the survivor community. However, she said she would like to see more concrete ideas from the administration for reform in the future.  Naomi Riley, the Undergraduate Students Association Council&#8217;s outgoing Academic Affairs commissioner and incoming president, said she is concerned the changes may make people relive their trauma, as Title IX hearings will be treated as a court of law.  USAC passed a  resolution  in support of survivors in the wake of the changes at its meeting Tuesday.  According to the resolution, USAC felt the administration should have voiced its support specifically for survivors rather than for all parties involved in Title IX claims.  The resolution also called for increased funding for the CARE program, which provides confidential support for sexual assault survivors and educational programming for student organizations.  Mihika Sridhar, USAC&#8217;s outgoing Student Wellness commissioner, said she hopes the resolution acts as a message to the administration that even before these new regulations, there already wasn&#8217;t enough support for survivors.  &#8220;After these new regulations have been put in place, ... it&#8217;s doubly, triply important and ... definitely more relevant (to provide adequate resources),&#8221; she said.

The homemade, low-budget 2003 film tells a story about inner group prejudice, in which a gang of Filipino Americans picks on Filipino high school immigrants. It is currently being screened in the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival's virtual showcase until May 23, which also features a  livestreamed Q&amp;A    with the filmmakers     to discuss their upcoming sequel, ""Lumpia With a Vengeance."" For writer-director Patricio Ginelsa Jr., he said the writing process began after watching a movie directed by his fellow USC alumnus John Singleton &#8211; ""Boyz n the Hood.""  ""It opened my eyes to a world I didn&#8217;t even realize was happening here in the U.S.,"" Ginelsa said. ""When I saw this young, 21-year-old African American filmmaker that could make a movie about his neighborhood, I figured I could do it too.""  Back in 1996, Ginelsa said he and his neighborhood friends came together to film the first two acts of ""Lumpia"" during summer vacation, but the footage was eventually shelved when he returned to school.   Three years later, UCLA alumnus A.J. Calomay met Ginelsa through a mutual friend and came on as the film's producer, taking the   footage and creating a trailer that kickstarted their professional partnership.  ""(Ginelsa) saw me as his creative partner, and so did I,"" Calomay said. ""We had the same sense of humor and creative sensibility.""    Ginelsa said Calomay's trailer allowed him to see his work in a different light and motivated him to complete the film. However, during its initial release, ""Lumpia"" did not garner much media attention, which Ginelsa said was likely due to the film's raw, amateur nature. But decades later, he said the filmmakers are honored to have the LA Asian Pacific Film Festival paying homage to it.   [Related:    Author Vi&#7879;t Thanh Nguy&#7877;n discusses Asian American representation in the media ]     Francis Cullado, the executive director of   Visual Communications, which programs the festival, said they adjusted to the pandemic by presenting older stories since they were unable to debut upcoming films in person. Instead, they utilized the online format to take the audience back in time to when Asian American cinema began, Cullado said.  ""We wanted to at least do a retrospective (approach) and have people rewatch or watch (""Lumpia"") for the first time to sort of gain an appetite for the second movie that&#8217;s going to come out,"" Cullado said. ""It's sort of like a flashback moment.""  Although the film festival does not explicitly list a collective   theme, Ginelsa said it is trying to celebrate the growth of Asian American cinema.   He said the filmmakers sometimes cringe at the sight of the nonprofessional nature of ""Lumpia,"" but the film's topics like anti-immigration and internal prejudice are still relevant to this day.    Not only are such topics in the Filipino community rarely seen in independent films, but Calomay said there are also very few Filipino American films in general. But in the context of today's cultural films, ""Lumpia"" can still be appreciated because of what Calomay sees as the growing desire for these stories within the Asian community.  ""I think people want to see more nuanced stories about our community, and this is one in particular that is pretty different,"" Calomay said. ""It&#8217;s a little irreverent, a little ridiculous and hyperreal.""  But to make these serious topics more digestible, Ginelsa said he packaged them in a humorous way. Although anti-immigrant measures and discrimination are very serious, Calomay said the audience will remember these themes if the film is made to be memorable, entertaining and relatable.   [Related:    Alumnus rolls out film aiming to stir pot with fresh take on marijuana culture ]   Ginelsa said he hopes their sequel,  ""Lumpia With a Vengeance,"" will highlight the advancement of Asian American cinema, especially since viewers are able to revisit the first of the series during this festival. The new film will be released this year, and Ginelsa said the crew is excited to be featuring the same group of neighborhood friends from almost two decades ago. However, they are also welcoming established actors such as Danny Trejo, who starred in movies such as ""Desperado"" and ""Bad Ass."" Regardless of their development as filmmakers, Ginelsa said the team hopes the audience will gain a more holistic understanding of their experiences as Filipino Americans.  ""When you think about Asian American stories, you have to understand that it isn&#8217;t about one particular kind of story or how we want to be represented, it&#8217;s about showing the kaleidoscope of what we are,"" Ginelsa said.

The 1918 influenza pandemic  promoted national health care  in Europe. The attacks of 9/11 brought heightened airport security with winding lines and shoeless passengers. The 2008 financial crisis transformed  the home-buying process .  And the coronavirus pandemic, when it subsides, will probably be no different. When our regular routines are fully upended, our old ways are often adjusted, and we face change  whether we like it or not.  However, we hope that the change will be for the better. In the words of Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff: ""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.""  Haroutune Armenian, a professor of epidemiology, emphasizes the important role that universities like UCLA can have in using adversity as an opportunity for positive achievement.  ""UCLA has the opportunity of developing projects, research and learning about some of the fallbacks and problems, as well as the possibility of learning some of the potential positives of this situation,"" he said.  In an effort to honor this positive school of thought and get the ball of progress rolling, The Quad is here to share some of the discussion buzzing among macro-thinking experts on how the coronavirus may shape our future.   [Related:    The Quad: Quarantine can be a time to follow in Shakespeares footsteps, explore new ideas ]     For starters, the current pandemic may introduce shifts in how we both learn and work. As a result of the pandemic, the use of  Zoom has skyrocketed  with at least 90,000 schools in 20 countries currently using the program for lectures, discussions, office hours and meetings.  Although the  debates  over whether online education is merely a substitute for face-to-face is ongoing, the shifts the pandemic has introduced in a matter of weeks will probably ignite conversations on learning remotely in the future.  For instance, Mary Kalantzis, a professor at the University of Illinois, said in an interview with  Illinois News Bureau  that higher education is experiencing a structural crisis caused by rising tuition and student debts.  Online education is an opportunity to increase programs while decreasing costs, she said. Even more so, she described how it might be beneficial for nontraditional students with family responsibilities as it gives them access to higher education.  Similarly, for many office workers, commuting an hour to work in a suit and tie may appear unproductive or senseless. With remote work already  increasing by 44%  in the U.S. in the last 5 years, the pandemic may introduce a turning point.  Katherine Mangu-Ward, the editor-in-chief of Reason magazine, told  Politico  that once companies strengthen their platforms for remote work, it will be harder and more expensive to deny employees these opportunities. Many things that could have just been an email might actually become just an email, she explained.  Another major shift the coronavirus has introduced is the power of telemedicine  healthcare via technology.  Associate professor Kimberly Gudzune and assistant professor Heather Sateia at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine recently wrote in  The Washington Post  that even beyond the pandemic, telemedicine will prove itself as a powerful tool.  In the past, health insurers have declined to cover virtual appointments, but with the coronavirus, theyve opted to change these policies and will probably continue to do so even when social distancing passes, Gudzune and Sateia wrote in the article.  With increased access to telemedicine, other potential intersecting barriers to healthcare such as race, gender, weight, income and geographic location may be alleviated. Telemedicine, although not able to solve all issues, may make the caregiver-patient relationship more accessible.  Beyond technology, the virus may also have significant political impacts, particularly in changing the landscape for voting. The 2020 election is quickly approaching and with several states already  postponing primaries , the process may look different.   [Related:    UCLA report urges vote-by-mail, other provisions for elections during COVID-19 ]      Over the last decade, voting in America has slowly transformed from a one-day communal experience to a multiweek individualized experience as more and more people participate in early voting. In an interview with  FiveThirtyEight , political scientist Paul Gronke called this a quiet revolution, and the coronavirus outbreak may introduce a sharp turning point.  In the wake of the pandemic and the social distancing encouraged throughout it, mailed ballots may become a new norm and Election Day may turn to Election Month in an effort to avoid crowds.  Similarly,  Lee Drutman , a senior fellow at New America, speculated   that such voting convenience will result in higher voter turnout, ultimately enhancing our partisan competition.  In addition to politics, social habits may also experience a shift. During the pandemic, touch has practically become taboo  the National Review even wrote  a eulogy for the handshake .  Some experts believe that even when the pandemic subsides, it will become our second nature to flinch at a handshake as we become increasingly aware of personal space and hygiene.  For instance, UCLA public health professor Roshan Bastani, said that people may be more comfortable just nodding in the future. There are many cultures that dont shake hands, opting for a bow or namaste instead, and we may see these greetings become more common, she explained.  On a larger scale, Bastani also said the pandemic may help society think more proactively, rather than reactively. She said   that the whole system  the government, public health departments, even businesses  will perhaps take a long-horizon planning perspective to be better prepared for future crises.  According to Henry Graber from  Slate Magazine , Americans will probably never stop going to sporting events or taking vacations, and no advance in technology will fully dissolve our natural tendencies as social beings. Nonetheless, there are still reasons to believe that change will happen.  ""We, as a human society, need to be able to develop a status that is antifragile, that does things better, at a different level than what was during the period of resistance,"" Armenian said.  When quarantine mandates do begin to slowly lift and life begins to reopen, most of us will probably be rushing back to regain a sense of normalcy. The reality, however, is normal might look different  and   hopefully, the new norms bring positive change.",['cap-rachel-sarrafzadeh'],"['student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/C95172BA-6FAE-4C07-AF0E-4B6991948FF0.jpeg

But keeping away from friends, family and other loved ones has proven to be much more difficult.  Social distancing is simple in principle  keep 6 feet between you and those around you. No groups, no crowded places.  The reasons for it are simple, too: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website explains that COVID-19 spreads primarily from people that are in close contact with one another. Specifically, the website explains how droplets from one persons mouth or nose can end up in another persons mouth or nose when they are in these close quarters.  Clearly, in a viral pandemic, this is something we want to avoid. However, even   though social distancing has been effective in slowing the emergence of new cases of the virus, it is also worth examining the potential negative side effects  especially those relating to social isolation.  With this in mind, The Quad is looking into different types of social isolation in hopes of avoiding its potentially harmful effects and looking out for those individuals who may be most vulnerable to experiencing them.  Naomi Eisenberger, a professor in UCLAs psychology department, detailed   some of these consequences of social isolation and emphasized the importance of social interaction for us as humans.  Were incredibly dependent on others, and so the way that our minds work, the way that our bodies function, is all regulated by our social relationships, Eisenberger said.  However, what is alarming is what happens when we do not have these relationships.  Some of the work that sort of demonstrated these strong links between social ties and health, or social ties and sort of life, have shown that people who have fewer social ties ... they dont live for as long, they get sick more quickly,"" Eisenberger said.   ""And some epidemiological studies have shown that the risk factors associated with being socially isolated are similar to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.   [Related:    Medical students adapt to unique challenges posed by lack of in-person learning ]     Along with this, the American Psychological Association recognizes that people with pre-existing mental health conditions, older adults and those working in health care may have a higher chance of experiencing some form of psychological distress in these conditions of social distancing, isolation or quarantine. To help with any of these psychological stressors that people may be experiencing, the American Psychological Association also published coping strategies and provided other links to  helpful resources during this time.   Clearly, social isolation can be extremely dangerous. However, not all types of social isolation are created equal.  Eisenberger described the difference between subjective and objective isolation, emphasizing that we need not necessarily fear the latter.  Specifically, she   said subjective isolation happens when an individual feels a lack of social connection despite the fact that they may be surrounded by people. Objective isolation, on the other hand, means that an individual does not have people around them. Additionally, Eisenberger explained that subjective isolation is more likely to be the culprit for detrimental health consequences.  Thus, it seems that, though many of us are disconnected physically during this period of social distancing, it does not have to mean we are disconnected completely.  After all, 6 feet can quickly turn into 6 inches   on any given Zoom call.     However, it is important to remember that social distancing is a largely novel concept, and the research on the effects of mass-scale physical separation is limited. Nevertheless, some researchers have already begun diving into the effects of social distancing as we now experience it.  University of Washington graduate student Adam Kuczynski and his advisor Jonathan Kanter launched a study that surveys 500 adult residents of the King County region   during this time of social distancing. The study tracks both how the participants are feeling and what they are doing in an effort to gather information that will provide insight into the public health measures that should be taken now and in the future.  Interestingly, results from the study indicated that people now might be managing the separation better   than they were initially. For example, data showed that peoples' anxiety was leveling off and people were exercising more as time went on.  However, though the good news is encouraging, the study also showed that there are unfortunately some people who are struggling a lot more than others. For example, on a scale of zero to 10 in terms of loneliness, Kanter  said in the article  that, while some were answering zero, others were answering 10.   [Related:    The Quad: Predicting the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the world ]      With so much uncertainty,   it is easy to worry about the potentially manifold consequences of this unprecedented period and its associated policies. Despite all this, there may also be room for hope.  Eisenberger emphasized that people are resilient, and the period in isolation may be less consequential than we might think.     ""People also adjust very quickly, and so it's also possible that, you know, I think this stay at home is starting to feel a bit more normal,"" she said. ""It could very well be that when this is all lifted, we could quickly go back to normal people, adjust very quickly to their new situations.

Despite what other countries or universities may be doing to ensure the safety of their residents, they have failed to follow suit.  And the problem starts in the housing department.  It is not difficult to gain access to residential halls on the Hill. The only hours when students have an extra safety net are from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. ,  when there is Access Control. However, restricted hours are most needed during the day when students are on campus. If someone without a BruinCard wanted to enter any building, all they would have to do is wait long enough for a student to swipe their card.  It therefore comes as little surprise that in the span of just two weeks in October, there were three burglaries reported on the Hill, some  during  the day, with students in their dorms at the time. If burglars are able to enter dorms while students are present, it is safe to assume access into residence halls is far too easy.  The fact of the matter is the university's current security measures do not protect students as well as it would like to believe. In return, students are paying the price for the universitys worrying reluctance to improve security on campus and on the Hill.  If UCLA Housing is attempting to keep students safe, it should add security beyond a simple ID card. The fact that dorm buildings are easily accessible is concerning given the  number  of alleged assaults on the Hill this year alone. UCLA must take these cases more seriously and implement measures that make Bruins safer, such as security cameras on individual floors. Because heightened security will be needed on a nearly empty campus, this is a golden opportunity for UCLA to implement more long-term Hill security once things go back to normal.  Because what it currently has is not enough.  It is inaccurate to say that anyone can walk into residence halls, UCLA Housing and Hospitality said in an emailed statement.  Yet despite this confidence, UCLA Housing still relies on external parties for students' protection. The three-point BruinCard check process UCLA Housing claims keeps residents safe is easy to bypass if an outsider waits for someone with a BruinCard to provide them access. UCPD is heavily relied upon given its officers are on the Hill all hours of the day.   A solution UCLA Housing is currently preparing is a new safety koban, a Japanese word for a small police station, outside the main entrance of Covel Commons. Initial staffing hours are expected to span 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. where people can use the koban as a source of information and a place to ask safety questions, report incidents, and initiate a report with UCPD.  UCPD maintains a wonderful relationship with Residential Life, UCLA Housing said. UCPD has patrol officers working 24/7, and they are regularly patrolling the Hill and all UCLA Housing properties as part of their regular patrols of the UCLA campus and its surrounding areas.  Then again, Jan. 28, two men allegedly  assaulted  two people with a handgun at Hitch Suites in broad daylight. As diligently as UCPD and UCLA might be working to ensure students safety, the new koban will only operate during the evening, even though many of these reported incidents are occurring during the day.  Grace Galey, a second-year global studies and political science student, said she is aware of the hesitancy residents might have if cameras were installed. However, she said she would feel safer if these safeguards were in place.  My first year on the Hill, someone deadbolted their door and someone stole their laptops and all their belongings, Galey said. I absolutely think cameras in the halls would be so helpful.  There are a number of ways UCLA Housing could go about making sure students feel safer, such as installing cameras in residential floors. Surveys could be sent out to students asking if theyd feel comfortable with this change. Alternatively, UCLA Housing could add cameras to certain buildings and provide students the option of living in them. A less intrusive option could be hiring Access Control all day.  And students have expressed an interest in having cameras installed given that if anything were to happen to them, they would be trapped in a classic case of he said, she said.  Nicole Durghalli, a fourth-year nursing student, said adding cameras to floors could be a second line of defense to the already implemented security.  ""Buildings that would have cameras could add an extra level of security,"" Durghalli said. ""It wouldn't hurt to add them in the hallways.""  Housing said cameras arent installed in individual floors out of respect for privacy. While this is a valid reason, implementing proper security measures isnt just an issue of property theft. Unhindered access to dorm buildings can easily lead to sexual assault, which is not  unheard  of at UCLA. Assaults are difficult enough for students to report, and in the wake of recent  changes  to Title IX laws that provide more rights to the accused, survivors will have an even harder time.     UCLA must take immediate action to protect its students.  Because if the nation's premier public university continues to disregard students' safety, it will lead in another category.  But this time, it will be for the wrong reasons  .",['cap-allison-oliva'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/db_5-1024x737.jpg

The United States Medical Licensing Examination program, which oversees the three-step exam required to obtain a medical license in the U.S., announced Feb. 12 in a  statement  that the Step 1 exam will transition from a number score to a pass-fail grading system. This could make other aspects of medical students&#8217; applications for residency more important and could also allow for a more holistic application process, according to UCLA faculty and students.  The Federation of State Medical Boards and the National Board of Medical Examiners, the co-sponsors of the exam, also decided to change the maximum number of attempts for each Step or Step Component exam from six to four. Additionally, the program will now require examinees to pass Step 1 before taking the Step 2 Clinical Skills test, according to the statement.  The program plans to implement the changes over the next 11 to 24 months with the pass-fail change taking place no earlier than January 2022.  The earliest class of students that will be affected by the change will start medical school later this fall if the Step 1 change is implemented in early 2022.  Step 1 focuses on basic scientific principles rather than clinical applications, and students usually take the test toward the end of the first two years of medical school, said Alice Kuo, a professor, chief of medicine-pediatrics and director of the Combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics Residency program at UCLA.  Students need to pass Step 1 before they are allowed to continue to the clinical years of medical school, and the number score is usually included in residency applications. The Step 2 exam, which students take between their third and fourth year of medical school, has a Clinical Skills and a Clinical Knowledge component, with the former already being a pass-fail score and the latter continuing as a number score, Kuo said.  Step 3 is taken after earning a doctor of medicine degree and completing one year of residency, Kuo said. Step 3 is required to apply for a medical license and confirms residents&#8217; abilities to treat and manage sick patients with a year of experience.  Divya Devineni, a fourth-year anthropology student who was recently accepted to several medical schools, will be part of the first class affected by the change. She said she initially felt relieved about the switch to pass-fail.   Her brother already has taken the Step 1 exam, and Devineni said she noticed him feeling overwhelmed while preparing for the test throughout almost his entire second year of medical school.  &#8220;When he was preparing, it was pretty stressful to the point that the school gave everyone almost a month off just to study for the test,&#8221; Devineni said. &#8220;There was just so much content and so much raw material that he had to know.&#8221;  Devineni said the Step 1 number score is often a defining factor for gaining acceptance to a medical residency after graduation,  so the switch might eliminate the pressure of needing a high score to land specialties that are considered more competitive, like surgery.  However, Devineni said she later began to feel stressed out because there will be more emphasis on other aspects during her time in medical school.  &#8220;I&#8217;m scared that medical school is going to turn into undergrad 2.0. ... What do we do now to differentiate ourselves for certain specialties?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just scared now everyone is going to have to do triple the amount of hours of research or extracurriculars or everything that we did in undergrad outside of school.&#8221;  On the other hand, without as much focus on the Step 1 score, incoming students can focus more on their actual classes and learning how to become a better doctor, said Sahar Ashrafzadeh, a medical student who will not be affected by the change.  However, Ashrafzadeh said personal connections might have a bigger hand in deciding medical specialties, since factors like letters of recommendation likely will be more important in the application. Knowing the right physicians can overshadow a medical student&#8217;s personal strengths and potential to be a physician, she said.  &#8220;If your letter-writers have a connection with a different institution, that can give a person a boost in their application to residencies versus having a score that reflects how well you were able to perform,&#8221; Ashrafzadeh said.  While Ashrafzadeh said the pass-fail change could be detrimental for those who might not have the right connections, Kuo said she thinks the switch will foster a more holistic application process to residency.  Kuo oversees the residency application process for her specialty and said becoming a doctor often favors students who come from families with more resources. When it comes to the USMLE Step exams, these students may have access to review materials, which can help them reach a higher score.  &#8220;It&#8217;s been increasingly more difficult for minority students to become physicians because they just don&#8217;t have access to those types of programs, and it all comes down to one number on the USMLE score,&#8221; Kuo said.  With the pass-fail change, any examinee who passes is knowledgeable enough to pursue medical school, which Kuo said is satisfactory.  Kuo said she has also heard concerns that without a number score for Step 1, students may feel more pressure to do well on the clinical knowledge component of the Step 2 exam. But since students sit for Step 2 CK near the end of medical school, Kuo said residency programs often do not even have access to the applicants&#8217; scores yet.   Kuo said her program voluntarily decided to blind faculty to all number scores when overlooking residency applications this year, including Step 1 or Step 2 CK if they were already available.  To implement a more holistic scoring process, she said her program looked for medical students who had worked with vulnerable populations and presented themselves well during tougher interview questions, such as how they handle stress.  Even though the application review was more time-consuming without any number scores to refer to, Kuo said her faculty felt more confident about their acceptances because they felt they gave each applicant a fair evaluation.  &#8220;This is a huge move for the board to decide to make Step 1 pass-fail,&#8221; Kuo said. &#8220;I will say those of us who have been advocating for a more holistic review process are pretty happy.&#8221; ",['cap-anushka-jain'],"['campus', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/3.2.news_.STEP1-01.png

This year, it did one better.     After finishing the  2019 season just a win shy from a shot at a national championship, UCLA will welcome the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation to Westwood.  However, the 14 incoming freshmen have to replace the 17 goals and 32 assists recorded by the players who have now left the program.  Goalkeeper Kelly McManus from Long Beach, California, will join the three remaining goalkeepers from last year&#8217;s squad, and the four will battle it out in training to see who will earn the starting spot, occupied for the last four years by  graduating senior Teagan Micah. In her tenure with UCLA, the Australian international Micah stopped 248 shots in 84 games, while only allowing 68 goals.  Associate head coach and recruiting coordinator Sam Greene said that with a new, experienced goalkeeper coach, the culture in training should promote competition between the players battling for minutes between the pipes.  &#8220;What&#8217;s nice about our goalkeeping environment is we have a new goalkeeper coach, Saskia Webber, who was on the 1999 World Cup team, so she knows what it's like to push (the starter) and get that training environment that you need,&#8221; Greene said. &#8220;We expect (McManus) to come in and really push for that (No. 1) spot.&#8221;  The Bruins have two new defenders coming to the program &#8211; Jordyn Gather hailing from Ladera Ranch, CA, and My Haugland S&#248;rsdahl from Kolbotn IL, a club team in her native Norway. The latter has 23 appearances for the Norwegian national team, playing from the U-16 to U-19 age groups. Greene said she anticipates that the Norwegian will be fighting for a starting spot as soon as she arrives on campus.  UCLA will have to replace four-year starter Kaiya McCullough, who was drafted by the National Women&#8217;s Soccer League's Washington Spirit with the No. 32 overall pick in the 2020 draft.  The midfield is where UCLA will be welcoming the most new faces, as six midfielders are set to join the program. Jen Alvarado, Isabel Loza and Michaela Rosenbaum join the team from throughout California, while the other three are Aislynn Crowder from Hawaii, Dasia Torbert from Georgia and Clara H&#228;rdling from Sweden all come from outside the Golden State.  Head coach Amanda Cromwell and Greene will look to mix and match incoming midfielders and those returning from injury with senior midfielder Viviana Villacorta &#8211; who started all 24 of the Bruins&#8217; matches in 2019 &#8211; in order to make up for the absence of graduating seniors Jessie Fleming and Anika Rodriguez. Fleming played in 75 games in the blue and gold and was a four-year starter, despite missing time for international duty with Canada. Greene said that she played a vital role for the Bruins and replacing her will be no easy task.  &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for the right partnerships, and obviously we can&#8217;t replace (Fleming), but hopefully we can throw some numbers at it and find what chemistry works,&#8221; Greene said. &#8220;Our incoming kids are full of national team experience and will be pushing that group as well. If you&#8217;re looking at (the) deepest positions on the team, midfield is one of them.&#8221;  Up front, the Bruins will add two full-time forwards in Kaila Novak and Reilyn Turner, and three more forward/midfielders with Megan Edelman, Jillian Martinez and MacKenzee Vance.   Amongst those whose contributions will need to be replaced are departing forwards Ashley Sanchez and Chloe Castaneda, the Bruins&#8217; second- and third-highest goal scorers a season ago, respectively.  Sanchez also recorded a program-record 12 and 15 assists in her sophomore and junior seasons &#8211; en route to a school-best 42 career assists &#8211; before signing a professional contract with the Washington Spirit in January.  Greene said UCLA got talented players that fit the program and is proud of the team's recruitment this year.  &#8220;Our mentality with recruiting is to always get the best players on the board, and obviously the best players with a character that fits UCLA and what it means to be a Bruin,&#8221; Greene said.

Graduate student Glen Meyerowitz saw the need for ventilators across the country and knew he could create a dramatically simplified, cost-effective ventilator to address the problems specific to the new coronavirus. He spent five years at SpaceX testing rocket propulsion and spacecraft systems before coming to UCLA to study electrical and computer engineering.  All within one week, he consulted with clinicians, developed a design for the ventilator, bought the parts from Home Depot and completed a functional device. Meyerowitz is a future fellow in the UCLA Biodesign program, which seeks to transform medicine and healthcare through new technologies.  Ventilators currently available are not cheap, with the average model for intensive care units costing tens of thousands of dollars, Meyerowitz said. These ventilators are built to tackle any problem a doctor could face when treating a patient, Meyerowitz said.  Meyerowitz focused on a simpler design for his ventilator to cut down costs and make it easier to use. He hopes the final design will cost between $1,000 and $3,000.  [caption id=""attachment_378930"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Meyerowitz's ventilator, built with components sourced from Home Depot, has a simpler design, making it not only easier to use but easier to produce multiple models of in a short time period. (Courtesy of Glen Meyerowitz)[/caption]  His ventilator is also much simpler to build, which means more can be produced in a shorter time span compared to those produced by major manufacturers.  Meyerowitz initially reached out to Jennifer McCaney, the co-executive director of the Biodesign program, and Desert Horse-Grant, the senior director of innovation and research at UCLA Health and a co-executive director of the Biodesign program, about his idea for a simplified ventilator.  When (Meyerowitz) came to (Horse-Grant) and I with the prototype, he was seeking resources, mentorship and help catalyzing this from a benchtop idea or a concept to preclinical and beyond, McCaney said. We were able to quickly catalyze and mobilize the Biodesign network to help him move the project ahead quickly.  Mathew Savary, the principal of the UCLA Innovation Fund and New Ventures at the UCLA Technology Development Group, played an integral part in managing the project as well.  The UCLA Technology Development Group works to advance innovation, entrepreneurship and research in startups, new inventions and the commercial operations involved in these projects.  By complete coincidence, Savary reached out to McCaney with his concerns about the availability of medical resources and the complex and long manufacturing process of ventilators currently on the market.  McCaney connected Savary with Meyerowitz, and the two began working together.  (Meyerowitz) has been doing the lion's share of the heavy lifting on navigating this project forward, Savary said. Ive been trying to help shepherd him through the process of building appropriate design requirements, and then we're going to be moving toward trying to get this manufactured and some money raised.  Soon after Meyerowitz and Savary connected, a team of engineers, clinicians, researchers and entrepreneurs from UCLA and around the country formed a nonprofit called Ventlife , based around Meyerowitzs prototype .  Meyerowitz contacted clinicians fighting the pandemic on the front lines to understand how ventilators are used, the problems they are seeing in hospitals and specific issues related to treating patients with COVID-19.  He noted four key components of a ventilator that clinicians labeled as necessary when trying to treat a patient with COVID-19: the ability to control the amount of air that is pushed into a patients lungs during each respiratory cycle, the rate with which air is pushed into the lungs, the pressure in the lungs and the fraction of expired oxygen.  Typically, air has 21% oxygen, but for certain cases, you might want to go up to 100% oxygen for short times if a patient is not getting enough oxygen in the lungs, Meyerowitz said.  Recently, Meyerowitz has spent time at the UCLA Simulation Center, which owns an artificial lung. By connecting his prototype to the lung, Meyerowitz is able to get data on how the device is working.  Thats really important in terms of validating how well the device performs, seeing issues and determining areas where it needs to be improved, he said.  Assuming there are no large changes made to the ventilator, Meyerowitz and the Ventlife team will focus on finalizing the design and then partnering with medical device manufacturers that have certifications with the Food and Drug Administration to produce products that will get approved.  [caption id=""attachment_378931"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Meyerowitz's ventilator has catalyzed the coming together of engineers, clinicians, researchers and entrepreneurs from UCLA and around the country. The team, called Ventlife, will focus on refining the design and getting it approved by the FDA.

Voter turnout among older adults has consistently overshadowed youth turnout, according to data compiled by the U.S. Census. Midterm election turnout among young adults has only exceeded 20% three times, in 1986, 1994 and 2018.  In the 2016 presidential election, 46.1% of those aged 18 to 29 voted, compared to 58.7% of 30- to 44-year-olds, 66.6% of 45- to 64-year-olds and 70.9% of those older than 65.  Young people have historically been underrepresented in voting because of their lack of participation, said Tim Groeling, a communication professor at UCLA and member on the UCLA Communications Board.  &#8220;Historically, there&#8217;s been a bit of a vicious cycle,&#8221; Groeling said. &#8220;Students didn&#8217;t turn out, so there weren&#8217;t policies or advertising to get them to turn out, since it&#8217;s easier and cheaper to reach older people.&#8221;  Students said, while they believe voting is important, some regulations may make it difficult for  some to participate.  Eric Newberry, a computer science graduate student, said he thinks the best way to make change at the local and national level is through voting.  &#8220;It&#8217;s one&#8217;s duty as an engaged citizen to participate in elections,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think (voting) is more important this year because it&#8217;s a presidential election, and that&#8217;s a very powerful position.&#8221;  However, he added that there could be a multitude of reasons students choose not to vote, ranging from having to obtain their home county&#8217;s ballot to being too busy with school to make time to vote.  Fernando Chavez, a fourth-year philosophy student, said he thinks voting for state measures is more important than voting for a presidential candidate since state measures are more likely to affect him.  He added that, in his experience, voting can be time-consuming and confusing since people may be too busy to stop by a voting center or may be unaware of certain voting rules, recalling a past experience where he waited in line for an hour only to learn he wasn&#8217;t registered in the county he was voting in.  &#8220;I feel like some people should probably be given the day to vote because it&#8217;s obviously important, but that&#8217;s not always the case,&#8221; he said.  Having a vote center in Ackerman Union may make voting easier and more convenient for students because of a large number of vote machines and accessibility settings for students with disabilities, said Hannah Carlan, an anthropology graduate student.  &#8220;This early vote setup they have at Ackerman Union is the most incredible thing I have ever seen in my years of being able to vote,&#8221; Carlan said.  Additionally, in previous elections, young people may not have turned out to vote because policies had not seemed relevant to them, said Jim Newton, a public policy lecturer and communication continuing lecturer and the editor in chief of UCLA Blueprint magazine.  However, Newton said he believes currently it is important for students to vote because today&#8217;s policies, such as those regarding climate change, are more significant to younger people than older people because younger voters are more likely to be impacted by these policy changes.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to live long enough to see the most pernicious effects of climate change, but you are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so if you care about that issue and wait until you&#8217;re my age to start voting in a way that helps that issue, it&#8217;s going to be too late.&#8221;  Thomas Latkowski, a second-year political science and applied mathematics student, echoed Newton&#8217;s position and said youth engagement on issues like college affordability and climate change will cause politicians to address them.  &#8220;Part of the reason that I'm voting, and part of the reason I think it would be fantastic if more young people vote in this election, like more young people voted in 2018, is that this will cause politicians to pay more attention to these issues, focus on these things, solve these problems,&#8221; he said.  Groeling added that, usually, single votes don&#8217;t play a large role in determining the outcome of elections, but it may be different this time.  &#8220;California is going to be more important in determining the Democratic nominee than normal,&#8221; Groeling said. &#8220;From a broader standpoint of being able to have (students&#8217;) support be more influential, this is a great time to vote.&#8221; ",[],"['campus', 'national', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/howtovote-final-maybe-01-583x1024.png

However, some students enrolled in CAE have requested fewer of their usual accommodations this quarter.     Elizabeth Laugeson, the creator of the UCLA PEERS program, which provides social skills intervention to those with an autism spectrum disorder said remote classes may present new social challenges for those with ASD. She said some adults on the autism spectrum have preferred learning online over learning in person, however.   &#8220;Communicating over web-based video conferencing platforms removes the need for interpreting many of the nonverbal social cues that are required for in-person interactions,&#8221; Laugeson said.  The move online has made things easier for Yanning Zuo, a graduate neuroscience teaching assistant with ASD.  &#8220;I would be drained every time after I had to attend a meeting or seminar or go to class physically,&#8221; Zuo said. &#8220;It's saving me commute time and the stress from social interaction.&#8221;  Online classes are less cumbersome than physical classes for Zuo because she does not have a high drive for social interaction. However, Zuo recognizes this is not the case for everyone with ASD.  Other students have been unable to find distraction-free environments. This has been the case for Izzy, a student with ADHD who asked for her last name to not be published.   Izzy, a third-year anthropology student, said she was concerned when she found out that classes were going to be moved online .   To manage her ADHD, she spent time at school developing routines and making behavioral modifications, such as distinguishing her &#8220;play&#8221; and &#8220;learning&#8221; areas ,  to help her stay focused on schoolwork.   But since the move online, she has lost some of that. For one, she has had to turn her bed   into a makeshift desk to stay away from distracting family living spaces.    &#8220;I had in place a system that worked for me after such a long time of trial and error,&#8221; Izzy said. &#8220;I guess I have to figure out new study habits.""  Test-taking under these circumstances may also pose problems for some students with disabilities. Because everything is being conducted remotely, the CAE cannot provide distraction-reduced exam environmen  ts, Kehdi said.  The CAE has implemented procedures to provide students who are blind ,  low vision  , deaf or have partial hearing loss with access to proper adaptive equipment and assistive technology to allow them to access online classes.      Nicole Taboada, a fourth-year sociology student who is deaf without hearing aids, said she has to have her laptop, iPad and a transcription app out to watch her online classes. And individual virtual meetings, such as   office hours, are a bigger challenge.  &#8220;I have to rely on Otter, (a voice transcribing app), which is pretty difficult because it can glitch,&#8221; Taboada said.  The biggest change for her, she said, was losing the on-campus presence of CAE accommodations, which has left her much more on her own as she figures out how to adjust.  The pandemic has also caused   problems for students outside academics and the guidance of CAE .    Higbie has had difficulty obtaining his ADHD medication because he lives further from the pharmacy at home than when on campus. It has become a big and frightening   task to leave the house and travel, so he has resorted to rationing his medication, Higbie said.  Students living in California can have medication mailed to them from the  Bruin Health Pharmacy .  The move to online classes has been easier   in some ways for students with disabilities, more difficult in others .  However, Izzy and Taboada agree that it is not the same as in-person classes.  &#8220;The transition to online education has taught me just how much I value physical schooling,&#8221; Izzy said.

All those photos are still there, but the more recent posts dont involve her sport, her team or being outside at all. Starting Jan. 3 Yeomans launched an IGTV series called Make it Real, which showcases how-to cooking videos made by the UCLA beach volleyball senior.  Yeomans has won two national championships with the Bruins, being called into the lineup last minute both years when starters were injured. She was once again fighting for time early this season, making seven starts across UCLA's 15 matches.  Even with much of her energy going toward the Bruins' run at a third straight title, Yeomans said she started the series this year, knowing she would have more time than usual since she planned to finish all her college credits during winter quarter.  With six full episodes as of May 19, Yeomans has featured everything from pesto chicken pasta, to lentil chili, to churros. Finding new and exciting recipes has been one of the hardest parts of the project, she said.  In the beginning, I wanted to put literally everything I cook, Yeomans said. But now Im finding that I cook a lot of the same things for myself. So I try to put new things, or things that use stuff a lot of people already have, or things that are versatile.  Yeomans said she always had a love for home-cooked meals  a regularity growing up with her mom in the kitchen  but didnt find a love for cooking until it was forced upon her.  It wasnt until the then-sophomore moved out of the dorms and was forced to feed herself daily that she even started cooking. Even then, Yeomans said it was a struggle to cook well while balancing her course load and beach volleyball regiment.  My sophomore year, I wouldnt really call it a love yet  I was just having to cook on my own, Yeomans said. (Since then), Ive definitely learned that cooking doesnt have to be a chore at all. It can be how you need it to be. You can make an hour recipe or you can make a 15-minute recipe.  More recently, Yeomans began sharing her love of cooking with her teammates by hosting team dinners and leading pre-match breakfasts on the road.  Yeomans said junior Megan Muret  with whom she had already played and won two court-5 matches this season  is her sous-chef of choice out of her UCLA teammates.  Muret said she helped brainstorm ideas for the cooking series theme and name prior to its launch online. And though her choice title of Madis Money Meals didnt make the cut, Muret said she has been impressed with how thoroughly Yeomans has developed the show.  Its super cool because a lot of us are like, Oh were so busy, I feel like I barely have time to do my school work, and here (Yeomans) is making a cooking channel, Muret said.  But since the coronavirus pandemic canceled NCAA seasons as well as in-person activities, Yeomans has had more time than expected to dedicate to her cooking project and has accepted the challenge of cooking with limited ingredients.  Its a great time to have (the IGTV series) and keep using it, Yeomans said. Quarantine cooking has been just really using what I have because going to the grocery store is just such a daunting task  Ive been really creative.  [caption id=""attachment_380350"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Yeomans took some time for a Zoom call with the Daily Bruin, showing off one of her favorite recipes  crepes. (Screen capture by Jacqueline Dzwonczyk/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  John Hook, with whom Yeomans moved in prior to quarantine, said Yeomans has already gone through other artistic phases  such as painting, pottery and crocheting  during her newfound downtime.  Her cooking show, despite the huge time commitment of preparing and editing each episode, has been one that has stuck, Hook said.  Now that shes done with volleyball too, she doesnt really know what to do with her time  like shes never had free time, Hook said. So shes trying to do everything that she couldnt all at one time and shes getting a little worn out on some things. But with the editing and coming up with ideas and cooking, its still there because she loves it.  Hook said the duo has taken this time to appreciate their shared love of cooking, regularly whipping up breakfast burritos, tri-tip tacos and crepes  a go-to for Yeomans, and her self-proclaimed sweet-tooth.  But the most important aspect of the series in Hooks mind is Yeomans' selfless approach.  She has a good mindset for it  her goal is to help others instead of just get likes, Hook said. I really like what shes doing with it.  This outlook is right in line with the shows message: Make it Real.  Yeomans said as she continues her cooking journey, she wants to stay true to this slogan  showing the mess-ups and how frustrating cooking can sometimes be  in the hopes that she can inspire more people to stick with the craft.  If you burn things, it happens  I still burn things, Yeomans said. The best part about cooking is being creative and finding ways around things that happen. So just keep trying.",['cap-jacqueline-dzwonczyk'],"['beach-volleyball', 'features', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/yeomans.png
409,/2020/06/10/the-quad-revisiting-affirmative-action-as-conversation-on-inequality-is-amplified/,220.0,206.0,174,166.0,0.8493999999999999,0.7545000000000001,$0.00,The Quad: Revisiting affirmative action as conversation on inequality is amplified,https://dailybruin.com/2020/06/10/the-quad-revisiting-affirmative-action-as-conversation-on-inequality-is-amplified/,"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 01:34:22 +0000",Camayak_df22eca8f2,"     The role of affirmative action in ensuring equitable access to college for communities of color has long been disputed.  In fact, for the state of California in 1996, the attempt to reach this goal of equitable access meant banning the use of affirmative action in university admission processes under Proposition 209, which states that ""the state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group, on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.""   Initially advocated for by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, Proposition 209 passed with nearly 55% of the vote, establishing a process pushed by proponents as a new merit-based system of judgment for California college hopefuls and effectively ending the implementation of affirmative action in the state.  However, while Proposition 209 was approved almost two decades ago with the goal of fostering equality through race-neutral admissions, its efficiency in doing so continues to be a topic that is hotly debated today.  Soon after its onset, there was a drastic drop in Black and Latino enrollment throughout the University of California system, but even more so at its most selective institutions, UCLA and UC Berkeley.   The number of newly enrolled African American first-years at UCLA dropped by nearly half &#8211; from 264 to 144 &#8211; within the time span of 1995 to 1998. Berkeley demonstrated a similarly substantial decline in African American enrollment  over the same period, falling from 215 to 126 first-years. In the fall of 2006, only 96 African American students were expected to attend UCLA, a number just shy of the 98 NCAA championships the Bruins had won at that point.  Declining numbers came quickly, and it would take years for either school to meet the enrollment rates they had before the ban took effect.   Additionally, despite African American and Hispanic students comprising more than half of all of California&#8217;s high school graduates, African American and Hispanic representation remained at approximately 29% of the total UC undergraduate enrollment in 2019.  The difficulties with maintaining a diverse learning population at UC schools after Proposition 209 was implemented are evidenced by the  s  ubmission of an amicus brief  by UC leaders to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 supporting affirmative action. Such briefs are typically filed by a person or group who has a strong interest in the matter with the intent of impacting the court&#8217;s decision.   UC president Janet Napolitano, along with 10 UC chancellors, wrote in support of the University of Texas in the 2015 Fisher v. University of Texas federal lawsuit, which was initially filed by two white women who claimed to have been rejected from the university because of their race.   The chancellors also expressed concern at the failure of the low Black and Hispanic enrollment numbers at UC campuses to accurately reflect California&#8217;s race demographics.   Admissions statistics shed additional light on low Black and Latino enrollment. In 2015, the Campaign for College Opportunity published findings about students of color in public higher education in California, revealing imbalances in the UC system: Two out of every three Latino and Black applicants were denied acceptance to the schools. And according to a University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey from 2014, African American students at UC Berkeley assessed the campus climate as &#8220;very poor.&#8221; Similarly, a study published in 2014 noted that Black and Latino students were less likely to attend racially diverse campuses at that time than at any point in the last 40 years.   Napolitano commented on the role of Proposition 209 in contributing to this phenomenon at a press conference: &#8220;The University of California belongs to the people of California, and race-blind admissions have curbed our ability to fully engage the learning potential found among this state&#8217;s diverse population.&#8221;   Proposition 209&#8217;s support relied in part on the fact that voters valued a merit-based system of judgment for prospective students. By definition, the idea of meritocracy says that individuals can become successful by working hard. The concept seems simple, perhaps even admirable in theory &#8211; but the generalization fails to consider that admissions components such as standardized test scores may not always be indicative of simply working hard or being motivated.   Additionally, meritocracy in college admissions is weighted differently, leading to divergent demographics at campuses throughout the United States. In a  Los Angeles Times article from 2010 , then-UC President Mark Yudof said that UCLA and UC Berkeley take holistic review more into consideration than other campuses such as UC San Diego, whose standards are less considerate of personal achievements and obstacles. Yudof also said in the article that formulas like UC San Diego&#8217;s may end up denying admission to academically eligible minority and low income applicants.   Yudof&#8217;s statements above were prompted after the UC system issued an apology to Black UC San Diego students for racist incidents at the La Jolla institution in 2010, promising reforms in admissions policies in order to boost minority populations at the school. These racist incidents included a controversy on Feb. 15, 2010, in which members of UC San Diego fraternities held a party called the &#8220;Compton Cookout&#8221; where students were encouraged to embrace African American stereotypes by inviting the women to dress as &#8220;ghetto chicks&#8221; and other stereotypically &#8220;ghetto&#8221; outfits to mock Black History Month.   Unfortunately, this incident wasn&#8217;t an isolated one: On Feb. 25 of the same year, a student was suspended for hanging a noose on the seventh floor of the Geisel Library.   In an attempt to address concerns put forth by UC San Diego&#8217;s Black Student Union, the administration said it would look for a place to start an African American resource center, address falling African American enrollment and establish a task force with the aim of recruiting minority faculty. While the percentage of African American students at UC San Diego has increased in recent years, they still make up a small percentage of the school&#8217;s population at only 2.6%, according to  UC San Diego&#8217;s 2018-2019 student profile . This number is low in comparison to the general population; according to United States Census estimates from July 1, the Black population in the U.S. is approximately 13.4%.   Even though many UC officials agree that aspects of Proposition 209 seem flawed, support for it may be continually perpetuated by agenda-setters at the forefront of the legislation.  White Americans, who comprise most of higher education faculty administration, are less likely to hold the assumption that ""a lot"" of discrimination persists today &#8211; only 16%, as opposed to 56.4% of Black Americans, according to a study conducted nine years ago. Another study from Inside Higher Ed said that 90% of college presidents held the notion that their race relations on campus were good, despite surveys such as the UCUES indicating that campus culture was not up to par. The assumption that inequality doesn&#8217;t exist could hurt the potential for realized institutional change.  In some ways, Proposition 209 seems to have provided some benefits along with the slew of controversy it has garnered. Graduation rates for black students have gone up; according to a law review from the Pacific Legal Foundation, UC Berkeley&#8217;s six-year graduation rate for Black students entering in 1998 increased by 6.5% compared to those entering in 1996.   People who have seen these increasing numbers may believe that Proposition 209 is doing more good than harm. But in considering the other factors, both hidden and in plain sight, there is more to Proposition 209 than what meets the eye.  During a time when striking inequality is being unearthed in our society, the educational realm &#8211; which regularly touts equality and solidarity &#8211; may require a more critical look.

410,/2020/06/10/transfer-students-work-to-find-funding-to-keep-doors-of-resource-center-open/,219.0,197.0,201,171.0,0.8889,0.79,$0.00,Transfer students work to find funding to keep doors of resource center open,https://dailybruin.com/2020/06/10/transfer-students-work-to-find-funding-to-keep-doors-of-resource-center-open/,"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 01:54:05 +0000",Camayak_1a78946290," On top of their already pressing challenges, transfer students now face the task of funding over $135,000 to sustain their own resource center.   The Cultivating Unity for Bruins Referendum, which would have paid rent for the Transfer Student Center, failed in the 2020 spring Undergraduate Students Association Council election. Without it, the TSC lacks stable funding for the 2020-2021 school year.  While transfer students are not the only ones that would have benefitted from the CUB Referendum, they face a diverse range of challenges, said Zuleika Bravo, the 2020-2021 transfer student representative.  The failure of the referendum most directly impacts the financial stability of the TSC, which serves as a hub for resources and information for transfer students, Bravo added.  &#8220;It's a one-stop shop for almost all transfer needs,&#8221; Bravo said. &#8220;To know that it might not be a possibility in the future would put a lot of students within our population at a disadvantage, and (they are) already disadvantaged coming into UCLA.&#8221;  As a result of a lack of administrative input, the student-led Transfer Leadership Coalition is left to find funding for the center on its own, Bravo said.  When the TLC helped draft the CUB Referendum, the center faced declining allocations for several years, Bravo said. This year, for the first time, the Student Fee Advisory Committee refused to pay the TSC&#8217;s rent, which is the center&#8217;s largest expense, Bravo added.  The TSC requested $131,127 from SFAC to cover rent for the 2019-2020 school year and was granted the full amount. This year, however, they requested $135,061 and received nothing.  The change was because of SFAC&#8217;s decision that student fees should not go toward paying rent, Bravo said.   TSC requested $146,836 in additional funds for the 2020-2021 school year, and SFAC agreed to pay $67,102.  The center will have to wait two years to reapply for SFAC funding, Bravo said.  &#8220;The reason why (funding was reduced) is unknown to us,&#8221; said Bradley Alvarado, one of two 2020-2021 TLC chairs. &#8220;We just have to accept it though.&#8221;  To make up for the lost amount and to fund the Transfer Pride Week, Bravo and Millie Stordeur, the 2019-2020 TLC chairs, requested $15,000 in surplus funding from USAC but received $9,000.  Since its establishment in 2017, the TSC has been funded by the Bruin Resource Center, the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, SFAC and donors, said TSC director Paolo Velasco in an emailed statement.  However, after the failure of the CUB Referendum and the minimal funds from SFAC and USAC surplus, the TSC does not have stable funding secured for the 2020-2021 school year.  &#8220;I see a lot of resources being taken away, and that makes a significant difference in the amount of programming that we can provide for transfer students,&#8221; Bravo said. &#8220;I do foresee it happening again in the future since I know for a fact that we just don't have programming funds.&#8221;  Bravo said that administrators told her they will find funding to prevent TSC from closing down. She added that the administration has the resources to fund the center without putting additional financial strain on transfer students, which is frustrating.  &#8220;If they can figure out a way to make it work, then they could have found a way to get rid of this problem this whole time,&#8221; she said.  Karina Arzate-Arenivaz, a 2020-2021 TLC chair who works as a TSC staff member said the center created a Giving Tuesday campaign to ask students for donations.  &#8220;I personally felt a little confused as to why we had to resort to (reaching) out to our students,&#8221; she said.  She added that some transfer students face little to no financial burden before they transfer.  Transfer students make up over 30% of the undergraduate student population, and 94% come from California community colleges, most of which offer the California College Promise Grant. The grant offers students two free years of community college, which is the typical amount of time it takes a student to transfer to a four-year university, Arzate-Arenivaz said.  &#8220;Community college lets a lot of people see that they are capable of going to a four-year institution,&#8221; Bravo said.  Once accepted to UCLA, however, there can be a difficult adjustment period, Arzate-Arenivaz said.   &#8220;I worked really hard for two years to try to go to a UC, and then the dream comes true and, and then it&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s next?&#8221; she said.  Transfer students may find it difficult to fit research, study abroad programs and internships into a two-year timeline, Arzate-Arenivaz said. But, TSC has resources to help, she added.  &#8220;The TSC plays a huge role in helping people navigate their way, which is why the center is so essential to the transfer community,&#8221; Alvarado said.  Alvarado and Arzate-Arenivaz are currently in training for their TLC positions. They said a large part of their training from the previous TLC chairs relates to institutional knowledge that will hopefully help them to secure funding. TLC will meet with administration throughout the summer to try to find a source of funding.  Bravo said that the center could potentially find sponsorship or donations, but both are uncertain because of the pandemic.  &#8220;We worked really hard just to be at UCLA and to be recognized as students who are on the same level as traditional students, and to put this added pressure on us that we need to find funding for this resource center is just really disheartening,&#8221; Bravo said. &#8220;You're putting a lot of work on students who just don't need that at the moment, especially right now.&#8221; ",['cap-samantha-fredberg'],"['academics-news', 'campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/transfer.challenges.illo_-1024x780.png

But like all other sports at UCLA and across the nation, their season was cut short.  Sophomore shortstop Matt McLain said No. 5 UCLA baseball (13-2) was preparing for the opening series against Oregon when the players first heard of potential cancellations and he was shocked at how quickly the outlook of the season changed.  I remember we were (putting) the tarps (on the infield), getting ready for Oregon, McLain said. We (heard) that some other teams (were) canceling the weekend series and we thought it might be one weekend canceled and then well get back to it. We (met) the next day, and everything, all over the country  outside of baseball  was shutting down. It all happened so fast. It was just pretty crazy.  UCLA had been off to a historically hot start before that moment. The last time the teams winning percentage entering the first weekend of Pac-12 play was higher than the 2020 squad's .867 mark came in 2010, when the Bruins made their first College World Series championship appearance.  A year later, UCLA became the only college program in the past 40 years to produce two of the first three picks in the MLB Draft  then-junior right-handers Gerrit Cole and Trevor Bauer, who were drafted No. 1 and No. 3 overall, respectively.  UCLA won its first 11 games this season and only dropped one contest at Jackie Robinson Stadium when it fell to then-No. 22 TCU in the last home contest of the shortened season.  ""(It's) just really devastation for the players, for the families of our players (and) everybody involved with the program,"" said coach John Savage. ""(Considering) what we had going on through the first 15 games, the momentum we were building, it was fun to watch  really special to be apart of. When the initial indefinite suspension came out, there was hope of possibly coming back, but at the end of the day, it was a lot bigger than anyone really anticipated.""  The Bruins built that momentum despite losing five pitchers to the 2019 MLB Draft, as the 2020 Bruins' pitching staff allowed the fewest runs in the nation. As a team, UCLA had a 1.88 ERA, good for the third best mark among Division I programs.  Junior right-hander Zach Pettway led the way for the Bruins pitching staff, making four Friday night starts and pitching to the tune of 3-0 record with a 1.05 ERA. After the season was canceled, Pettway picked up D1Baseballs Pac-12 Most Impressive Pitcher Award and was ranked the top junior pitcher in the country.  Pettway said he was excited with the teams start to the season and thought they were only going to improve week after week.  We had a lot of untapped potential that we were just getting (to), Pettway said. We were getting better each week we were playing, and we were getting closer and closer (to where we wanted to be).  After Pettway and the other starters  sophomore right-handers Nick Nastrini and Jesse Bergin and freshman righty Jared Karros  came out of the game, Savage handed the ball over to his bullpen, which worked over 57 innings, and allowed only eight earned runs.  Junior Michael Townsend led the bullpen with 12 innings in 11 appearances. The righty did not give up an earned-run and allowed just one hit through nonconference play.  Senior right-hander Kyle Mora also made 11 appearances out of the bullpen and allowed one earned run in 9 1/3 innings of work. He struck out 15 batters to bring his four-year total to 127 in 124 1/3 innings.  The Bruins' closer, junior right-hander Holden Powell, fanned 20 batters in 9 1/3 frames across eight scoreless outings.   [Related:    Graphic: Shutting the door   ]   The trio combined to throw 30 2/3 innings of one-run ball and struck out 47 hitters. Savage said being able to rely on his top three relievers gave him a vote of confidence about managing his pitching staff.  It built depth on the roster, Savage said. We were getting good starting pitching  getting five innings, six, I think we had a seven (inning-start) in there. So I could just (have) a lot of trust in the bullpen.  Offensively, the Bruins averaged over seven runs per game and, as a team, got on base at a near-.400 clip.  In his second season in Westwood, McLain slashed .397/.422/.621 and led the team with three home runs, despite missing two of the last four games because of illness.  While McLain was doing damage from the No. 3 spot in the lineup, Savage penciled in the same name at the top of it each game  Garrett Mitchell. The junior center fielder reached base 30 times in 15 games and led the Bruins in runs scored for the second consecutive season, with 18.  ""I think everybody knew how talented (Mitchell) was coming out of Orange Lutheran High School,"" Savage said. ""But to see the player that he evolved into, and not being able to fully see his junior year, that's (what) really hurts. You can only really dream of what it could have been.""  In three years with the Bruins, Mitchell had an .871 on-base plus slugging percentage and has earned the No. 6 spot on MLBs 2020 prospect rankings. The junior from Orange, California, is projected to be drafted in the first round of the 2020 MLB Draft and not return to Westwood in the fall.  [caption id=""attachment_378417"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Before its season was cut short, No. 5 UCLA baseball won 13 of its first 15 games through nonconference action and was preparing to defend its Pac-12 title  beginning with a home opener against Oregon. (David Rimer/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  On March 26, the MLB and MLB Players Association met and discussed shortening the draft from 40 rounds to one that may only have five to 10 rounds. With the shortened draft, a fewer number of players will have the opportunity to sign pro contracts, and more Bruins may come back for an extra year of collegiate eligibility.  The NCAA has granted spring-sport student-athletes the opportunity to take an extra year of eligibility if they choose to do so, meaning Mora, senior left fielder Kyle Cuellar, senior catcher Will McInerny and senior right-hander Felix Rubi could potentially compete in the blue and gold one more time in 2021.  But just as the MLB is unsure of its final plans for draft and its upcoming season, Savage said his 2021 roster is also a major question mark.  There are still a lot of unanswered questions, Savage said. You have the draft  is it five rounds, is it 10 rounds  that affects our rosters. I don't think anybody absolutely knows their roster right now. Theres still a lot of things to happen, namely the draft. So were just going to see who gets drafted and who wants to continue their education and their eligibility in our program.",['cap-taiyo-keilin'],"['baseball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.sp_.baseball.nbk_.DR_.jpg

Graduate students at UCSC began a union-unapproved strike in December in an attempt to increase their wages as part of a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA. In their second strike, which began Feb. 10, graduate students refused to teach, grade or hold office hours.  UCSC announced last week that it would provide Master of Fine Arts and doctoral students with a $2,500 retroactive housing supplement if teaching assistants turned in grades and resumed their duties. Fifty-four TAs continued to withhold undergraduate fall grades and were subsequently fired from spring appointments by the University of California Office of the President on Friday.  The Ucla4Cola organization rallied in Portola Plaza on Monday and marched to the Fowler Amphitheater, where it discussed potential striking options and voted unanimously to strike Thursday for one day.  Dylan Fitzwater, a UCLA graduate student in anthropology, informed the crowd of other potential responses to UCSC. Other options included rallying, demonstrating, occupying a building on campus and shutting down bus routes, he said. Long-term options included striking for more than one day and withholding grades from students.  Graduate students voted for a daylong strike. Fitzwater led the vote and announced that the strike would take place Thursday alongside other UC campuses pursuing protests, including UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara.  &#8220;We cannot afford to live here,&#8221; said Zak Fisher, president of the Graduate Students Association and a law student at UCLA. &#8220;Rallies like this are happening on a weekly basis now and something must be done.&#8221;  Graduate students supporting cost-of-living adjustments have rallied several times at UCLA over the last two weeks.  Some of the graduate students who voted are not employed by UCLA, and others raised concerns that those who are employed by UCLA may decide not to join them on the picket lines.  Toby Higbie, a UCLA history professor, warned the crowd that although more than 240 faculty have signed a nonretaliation statement, strikers may still experience backlash.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not very difficult to sign a letter saying you won&#8217;t retaliate, and I wouldn&#8217;t pin my hopes on that,&#8221; Higbie said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the faculty that would retaliate, anyways. At UCSC, it was the Office of the President.&#8221;  Many graduate students were concerned about losing their jobs. Graduate students at UCSC were paid for their work even through their strike &#8211; up until they withheld grades last week, said Sonya Rao, a UCLA graduate student in anthropology.  Rao said it is safe to assume that graduate students&#8217; jobs are safe up until the point of withholding grades.  Rao added support from both graduate and undergraduate students is strong enough to successfully execute a strike. She cited a survey in which 98% of the 500 UCLA undergraduate student respondents said that they would support the graduate students' actions.  On Thursday, TAs participating in the strike may either cancel their classes or teach their classes by the picket lines.  A recent protest at UC Irvine turned violent when police intervened, said Diana Gamez, a graduate student at UC Irvine who attended the rally. Similarly, at least 17 graduate students at UCSC were arrested at one of the February protests after it turned physical.  &#8220;If you all don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re ready (to strike), you are,&#8221; said Cierra Sorin, external president of UCSB's Graduate Student Association.  She added other UC campuses will support their decision. ",[],"['campus', 'news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.news_.colarallypt2.LMan_.jpg

But in the midst of remote learning forced by a global pandemic, its no longer a choice spurred by procrastination  its the unfortunate reality for UCLA students now scattered all over the world.  Following the suspension of in-person classes on March 10, Bruins from far and wide made the decision to either hunker down in Los Angeles or leave Westwood to return home.  But with more than 6,500 international students from nearly 100 countries and an average of 16.7% of enrolled freshmen being from out of state in the past four years, UCLAs community is more widespread than ever.  In an effort to accommodate students, the Academic Senate was quick to include extensions that would allow students to change their grading status to Pass/No Pass until the last day of spring quarter without needing a petition, as well as granting students the ability to take multiple classes on a P/NP basis.  The decision was a solid start to mitigating educational discrepancies caused by online instruction. But with such a diverse body of students from every time zone imaginable, the Academic Senate needs to extend its requirements for professors by implementing an addendum that would mandate flexible accommodations for testing, specifically for out-of-state and international students. In addition, the Academic Senate must urge professors to record lectures and make them permanently available to enrolled students.  Because professors haven't been equally accommodating. Some have gone so far as to mandate online attendance, conduct in-class examinations and refuse to record lectures because of privacy concerns.  For local students, thats a mere inconvenience. But for out-of-state and international students, it means that 3 a.m. classes are the new 8 a.m. classes.  Considering students are already put at a disadvantage by online instruction, providing increased accessibility and flexibility can only help make it easier for them to learn effectively. Even without time zone constraints, students may be enduring financial hardships or family emergencies in these unprecedented times. Mandating attendance and enforcing scheduled examination times only further isolates students from their learning community.  The new world of widespread online learning isnt ideal for administrators, professors or students. But the lack of a cohesive policy regarding online learning accommodations for those in different time zones makes the transition increasingly daunting, especially given midterms in the coming weeks.  Compassion and understanding from professors shouldnt need to be enforced. But considering the discrepancies the last weeks have presented, the Academic Senate will need to step in to accommodate the new needs of students in different time zones.  Though many professors have found unique ways to make their classrooms accessible, the lack of uniform enforcement from administration leaves UCLA with no standardized measure of student success. And while there are valid concerns about students cheating during exams or a lack of attendance during lectures, students being pushed to the brink of exhaustion by time zone differences isnt going to yield grades reflective of their abilities, either.  In a March 26 email from the Academic Senate, it urged the UCLA community to work together in a spirit of patience and empathy as we pursue our educational goals during an uncertain time.  But now that many professors arent taking that approach, its time the university steps in.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/edi.lectuerRIGHT.png

Rockwood, a fourth-year economics student, and Grusd, a fourth-year communication student, said they wanted to find a way to spread positivity and give back to communities affected by COVID-19, especially after seeing an overwhelming number of negative posts on social media in response to a virtual spring quarter and graduation ceremony. In response, they founded Class of COVID-19, a small business that sells T-shirts and stickers with &#8220;Class of 2020&#8221; on them,   only &#8220;2020&#8221; has been crossed out   and   replaced by &#8220;COVID-19  .""

The pair settled on Class of COVID-19 T-shirts because they said shirts were the most symbolic &#8211; because of how shirts communicate affiliations in college &#8211; and feasible. The two hoped the simple and comedic design would represent the class' situation, while simultaneously providing a bit of levity to the graduating seniors.   ""We hope these shirts make people reminded of how unique our situation is and act like a beacon to also be productive in this time and make the most of it,&#8221; Grusd said.  Rockwood said they were excited to reinvest in the economy through their business   and make a difference in the process. Rockwood said they   print their shirt products at a local store in Grusd's home state of New Jersey as a way of pledging support of small businesses. Rockwood had founded a business before, but Grusd said that she had no entrepreneurial background, so she had to learn how to adjust their marketing, products and even website design to maximize sales.   [Related:    Student's fundraising efforts can be chalked up to passion for sidewalk art   ]   Rockwood said constantly adjusting the business' different products and strategies for selling was essential for their business' growth .  These various adjustments included shifting advertisements from Instagram to Facebook groups, where their product has been well-received and adding new products like stickers and tie-dye versions of shirts that allow for greater customization.  &#8220;It&#8217;s all just been a learning experience, changing different levers to see what people will buy,&#8221; Rockwood said.  Their series of tweaks has allowed   the business to expand as the pair has fulfilled more than 100 orders since their business started. Class of COVID-19 shirts are now purchased overseas as well &#8211; especially in Australia &#8211; which the pair attributes to the universality of the shirts, which have multicolored and tie-dyed variations.   This growth   was encouraging to   Rockwood and Grusd,   giving them the opportunity to increase their donations to Feeding America. Initially, the pair had planned to donate 20.20% of profits but said they were now aiming for a minimum $1,000 donation to the charity. Rockwood   said that the growth of their business would only lead to the growth of their mission as well.    [Related:    Alumna brightens up pandemic with affordable, colorful masks   ]   These greater sales and product diversification also demonstrate the co-owners&#8217;   love for business, said fourth-year theater student Jessie Guthrie.   She said   Class of COVID-19 is a very   mindful business   in the current atmosphere, especially because the business connects school   seniors in a way that negative social media posts   haven't.   &#8220;It&#8217;s a cool way to unify everyone who&#8217;s going through the same thing ... and obviously the money also goes to a good cause,&#8221; Guthrie said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also poking humor at the situation.""  Class of COVID-19 shirts' optimism and humor demonstrate the upbeat personalities of the business' founders, Guthrie said. She said her peers have appreciated the unifying nature of the product, which is what Rockwood and Grusd had set out to do. Grusd said they hope their business will inspire more positive actions across the class of 2020.   ""We're quarantined, but that doesn't mean we don't have to do anything,&#8221; Grusd said. &#8220;We can give back to others even if we're feeling a little bit low based on our own situation.&#8221; ",['cap-daniel-lin'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/hz.web_.gradissue.ae_.classofcovid.SJ_.jpg

But first impressions don't mean everything.    &#8220;He&#8217;s actually kind of a goofball,&#8221; Phillips said. &#8220;I think that he sees that I&#8217;m also a goofball so it&#8217;s a lot of fun playing under him. He&#8217;s just the smartest coach I think that I&#8217;ve ever had. It&#8217;s a great thing to be a part of.&#8221;   Many of the women's players have expressed the same notion: Playing with Wright as their coach both in and out of the pool is an experience unique to him and UCLA.   In her first year of play, Phillips tallied a team-leading 83 saves helping lead the Bruins to a 19-2 record and the No. 2 ranking before the season was cut short.  Freshman utility Abbi Hill &#8211; whose two older sisters also donned UCLA polo caps &#8211; was another statistical leader, pacing the Bruins with 41 goals.  The two numerical leaders at both ends of the pool said Wright carries himself with a certain integrity and authenticity that's exhibited in his leadership.  &#8220;The Adam Wright culture is probably the best culture in my life that I&#8217;ve ever been in,&#8221; Hill said. &#8220;He is one of, if not the most, respectable person I&#8217;ve ever met. I think that this culture is one that is unique to just UCLA water polo and I know that no other school does it.&#8221;  Hired in 2017, Wright began his journey with the women's team after coaching the previous eight seasons with the men. Now coaching both teams, he has a 267-47 record with the men and an 85-19 record with the women Bruins.   But Wright's first experiences with UCLA did not start as a coach. He played water polo for the Bruins from 1997-2000, finishing as a two-time NCAA champion.  He continued his playing career for Team USA in water polo, where the attacker was a three-time Olympian playing in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 summer games.  His players have said he is able to utilize his knowledge from winning as a player to find success from the coaching stool, winning three NCAA championships as a head coach at UCLA.  Under Wright's guidance, sophomore utility Katrina Drake went seven goals as a freshman to second on the team with 29 during her abridged second season.    &#8220;The Adam Wright culture is awesome,&#8221; Drake said. &#8220;It's definitely more structured than I&#8217;ve ever had in the past, but it&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s helped me understand a lot (about water polo).&#8221;  Not only does Wright use his knowledge and expertise to help his athletes in the pool,  but he also understands the importance of building an outside environment with his players that gets the most out of them.  Junior attacker Lexi Liebowitz &#8211; who was named Mountain Pacific Sports Federation All-Academic Scholar-Athlete and earned three appearances on the UCLA Athletic Director&#8217;s Honor Roll &#8211; said the Bruins' women&#8217;s water polo community is distinct in that no one person is perceived as greater than the next.  ""We focus on everyone being equal and no one person is greater than the next,"" Liebowitz said. ""I&#8217;ve said it a million times, he repeats himself too, but we focus on the small details, being present, every game is the same and bringing it all the time.""   A UCLA graduate himself &#8211;  attaining two bachelor degrees in 2001 &#8211; Wright embodies the amalgamation of student and athlete.  Sophomore center Ava Johnson, one of eight UCLA players named to the 2020 MPSF Women's Water Polo All-Academic Team, attributes the coaching staff's support to her success.    &#8220;(The coaching staff will) push us to our breaking point,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;They want what&#8217;s best for us in the water, but it&#8217;s only for our benefit. Outside the pool they have our backs in anything that&#8217;s going on in our personal lives or school.&#8221;  As the only active senior offensive player this year, attacker Emily Skelly provides a unique understanding of Wright&#8217;s culture, as she is one of the few players to have played under a different UCLA water polo coach. In her freshman year, Skelly played  in one game under former coach Brandon Brooks before Wright took over before her sophomore year.   &#8220;He believes in every one of us,&#8221; Skelly said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no hierarchy, there's no seniority. We&#8217;re all trying to accomplish the same goal. Even down to the people who run the clocks at our games, everyone is the same and everyone is equal. I think that&#8217;s super unique for a team, especially at our level. It&#8217;s super cool to be a part of.&#8221; ",['cap-kyle-boal'],"['features', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/sp.gradissue.culture.ADX_.jpg

The third-year film student is creating a documentary that showcases the various ways people are adapting to life under quarantine. To combat the fact that he cannot physically film each of his participants, Kung is recruiting volunteers to film themselves at home in an attempt to crowdsource footage through various social media platforms. Those who are interested can send him footage that he will compose into a unified documentary, he said.  This is kind of new for us, Kung said. We humans are used to going out to do things, and now everythings online  its kind of like a new mode of living. My documentary is just trying to show how people deal with it.   [Related:    Student aims to foster artistic expression in UCLA community, even during pandemic   ]   The only explicit instruction Kung said he gave participants is to film how they are dealing with life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other than that, he said the volunteers have their own freedom to decide what they include in their submissions. Since his initial posts, Kung has received a wide variety of footage, from cooking to creating TikToks. Many participants have also chosen to simply send videos of themselves discussing their feelings on the current situation.  Kung said he hopes to present diverse perspectives by obtaining footage from people in different countries. His social media posts have reached his home back in Australia, inspiring his friend, Juliette Wright, to participate. Her occupation as an essential worker at Bunnings Warehouse, a hardware store, allows her to present an uncommon experience, she said, as her job permits her to take brief breaks from complete isolation.  Id say I have (a more balanced) life at the moment because I can go out and socialize with people at my work, but then I also have to stay at home, Wright said. I get to talk a little bit more about what Ive been doing, instead of what I cant do.  [caption id=""attachment_379154"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Catherine Xie/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  Aside from being able to unite a large quantity of seemingly disconnected people, Kung said the crowdsourcing technique also lets him create a more nonlinear documentary. A traditional documentary possesses a narrative that pushes the story through a climax and into a resolution, a quality that Kung said he is trying to avoid. Rather, he said the collection of footage tells a story all on its own.  The idea of crowdsourcing is that its from so many people and you dont necessarily need a narrative to tell people something, Kung said. Im using the power of ensemble ... to show the audience that a lot of people have an issue without having to say it.  Not only are the experiences in each submission distinctive, Kung said, but the lighting, angle and movement in each clip is different as well. He said he did not give specific preferences for the cinematography of the submissions, as he is not placing too much emphasis on artistic filming, for the sake of crowdsourcing. However, after creating a rough cut of all the footage he has received so far, Kung said he found that a landscape orientation and a shaky camera can deliver an engaging story more effectively than stable images, which are less interactive.

The clips can be grouped based on common themes, Kung said, like shots of empty streets or more emotional videos of people expressing their feelings. By locating and tracing a common thread that unites the videos, he said he will be able to craft a cohesive documentary.  Its all based on (how) people (film) their footage because Im trying to give them more agency, Kung said. At the same time, it also shows different people do different things  it shows the (versatility) between people.  Each submission contributes to a grand overall product while also conveying its own story, Kung said. Katelyn Darrow, a fourth-year anthropology and gender studies student, sent a video sharing her experience as a first-generation college student missing out on graduation, a tale that she said is all too familiar for her fellow students. As a worker for a catering company, Darrow said she  like many others  has also lost her source of income.  I hope that my contribution will resonate with other people, whether they are also out of work at this time or are experiencing a loss of events (like graduation), Darrow said. Perhaps by sharing my experience, theyll feel a little less alone in this pandemic.  By stitching together the videos he receives, Kung said he hopes that he can create an observational documentary that avoids criticizing how the COVID-19 pandemic was dealt with or preaching an overarching message. Instead, he said the focus is upon the resilience of human beings during uncertain times.  (I want) to show people how humans deal with different types of situations flexibly, how humans can come up with interesting or creative ways ... to deal with the change of life, Kung said.

For student-athletes performing at a high level of their sport, this sentiment may ring particularly true. With sports nutrition as a burgeoning field of study, athletes are increasingly encouraged to monitor the food they eat in order to have an optimal performance during competition day.  Due to the season being cut short from the coronavirus outbreak, UCLA track and field athletes used to eating food prepared at school are tasked with the challenge of keeping their bodies in top shape at home.  &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely been a bit of a challenge (to keep in physical shape), especially with all the restrictions around going outside,&#8221; said senior distance runner George Gleason. &#8220;Back at UCLA, we had all those amenities available to us, where you know you&#8217;re getting the proper fuel and that you&#8217;re getting taken care of. We also lose the cultural aspect as well, not being able to finish a hard run and then go in and eat with all my teammates.&#8221;  With stay-at-home orders in place across the nation, Gleason said that diet has taken on an even larger role in ensuring that athletes don&#8217;t fall out of shape during these trying times to keep the immune system running well.  However, Gleason said the time at home has afforded some student-athletes the opportunity to spend more time with their families, which can help with healthy eating and sparks cooking adventures with the family.   ""I&#8217;m definitely lucky because ... my family is pretty active, so my parents have been taking really good care of us, making sure that we have everything we need to be eating healthy and staying healthy,"" Gleason said. ""We&#8217;ve also been taking advantage of the time together and making some brownies, definitely getting into the sweets as well.""  Eating well during the season can also play a role in keeping athletes in competition-shape. Throughout the course of the 2019-2020 season, several members of UCLA track and field shared what their go-to pre-meet meals are, and the results showed a wide range of preferences.   Protein, a building block of the body&#8217;s muscles, appeared to be a popular choice among Bruins.  &#8220;The night before a meet, I&#8217;ll usually go for a salad with grilled chicken,&#8221; said junior thrower Alyssa Wilson. &#8220;I like to get a lot of protein in so I&#8217;m fueled and ready to go the next morning. Nothing too heavy, usually just super light.&#8221;  While Wilson favors a light, protein-heavy meal, other athletes identified carbohydrates as the most essential nutrient for them on race day. Both senior distance runner Riley Kelly and junior distance runner Christina Rice said pasta is their go-to meal before a meet.   Pre-race pasta meals can build up the body&#8217;s energy reserves through the conversion of carbohydrates to glucose, which in excess is converted to and stored as glycogen within the body that can be used as an energy source during a race.  Gleason echoed the carb-loading sentiment.  &#8220;If I can, I go for some Thai food, a chicken pad thai. And then oatmeal and coffee,"" Gleason said. ""You just want to go real big on the carbs. No holding back, just full carbs. I eat like three pad thais. Probably 5000 calories.&#8221;  Not all athletes said they had a real preference for a particular food before competing. Senior distance runner Arturo Sotomayor said he prefers to switch things up.  &#8220;Sometimes it&#8217;s pasta, sometimes it&#8217;s pizza, sometimes I&#8217;ve had a steak,&#8221; Sotomayor said.  Although athletes may have to adapt to quarantine conditions, they said maintaining their diets is important for staying in shape through these times.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health confirmed there are six new cases of COVID-19 and declared a public emergency in Los Angeles County at a press conference Wednesday morning. On Thursday, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health  announced four new cases in LA County , increasing the total count to 11.&nbsp;    This is not a response rooted in panic, said Kathryn Barger, the supervisor of the 5th District, at the conference Wednesday. Proclaiming a state of emergency enhances our preparedness and response capabilities while also providing opportunities to seek assistance from state and federal partners.    There were seven confirmed cases of coronavirus in LA as of Wednesday morning, said Barbara Ferrer, the director of the LA County Department of Public Health, at the press conference.&nbsp;    Out of the six new cases, one is hospitalized and the other five are in home isolation, she said. All of the new cases are linked to a known exposure, Ferrer said.    One of the cases, which is currently in house isolation, is being watched over by the Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center, according to    CBS Los Angeles   .    Three were traveling in coronavirus-stricken Northern Italy, two were in close contact with a family member who tested positive for the virus and the last was exposed through his job to people who might have carried the disease, Ferrer said. The four confirmed infections announced Thursday were part of the same group traveling in Northern Italy, according to the Department of Public Health.&nbsp;    The    first person infected    in LA County, whose case was confirmed in January, is no longer afflicted and was cleared from the hospital.    The declaration comes in light of the first coronavirus-related death in California, which occured in Placer County, according to a    statement by Placer County Public Health officials   . The patient was an elderly adult with underlying health conditions who tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from a cruise, the statement read.&nbsp;   The news of the death prompted California to declare a state of emergency Wednesday afternoon, according to a  press release  from the Office of the Governor.  In the press release, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the emergency proclamation would help the state prepare in case the virus continues to spread.   [Related:    UCLA experts dispute effectiveness of airport screening in detecting coronavirus   ]    Declaring a public health emergency allows LA County to seek future reimbursement from the state and federal government, Ferrer   said. LA County is also increasing testing capacity and has received test kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she added.    The UCLA administration is also increasing its response.    In an emailed statement sent to students Wednesday, Chancellor Gene Block said that, although there are currently no cases of the coronavirus at UCLA, the administration is looking to increase the use of online lecture resources such as Zoom or BruinCast.&nbsp;    If necessary, the university may provide opportunities for remote test-taking, Block added.    UCLA will also start to offer in-person informational meetings around campus and has started a    coronavirus information page    on UCLA Newsroom.    According to a Wednesday    statement    from UCLA Athletics, all scheduled athletic events will continue as planned. However, meet-and-greets and public autograph sessions with student-athletes have been postponed until further notice, the statement read.    Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he signed a declaration of a local emergency for the City of Los Angeles, at the press conference Wednesday morning.  &nbsp;    The City of Pasadena and the City of Long Beach will also be declaring local emergencies, although there are no confirmed cases in either city.    LA County is the next major California region to declare a public health crisis, following Marin County, San Francisco and Orange County.    The declaration also follows an increase in U.S. infections, including nine coronavirus-related deaths in Washington state.&nbsp;    Hilda Solis, the supervisor of the first district, said she thinks it is important to get accurate information because misinformation has cultivated fear and discrimination.&nbsp;    The last thing we want to do is create more fear in our community, she said at the press conference. Fear will not drive our responses.  ",['cap-bernard-mendez'],"['los-angeles', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/breaking-1024x618.png

While sports video games are exclusively made for professional leagues at the moment, that could be changing sooner rather than later.  The NCAA will be granting student-athletes access to their name, image and likeness rights as soon as 2021, meaning EA Sports' NCAA Football and Basketball franchises could soon make their long-awaited returns. With the return of those games  and possibly more  comes the return of iconic cover athletes, and the Daily Bruin Sports editors broke down which Bruins would best represent their sport if the games were to come out this fall.  In the past, EA Sports would pick NBA and NFL rookies as its cover athletes because current student-athletes weren't allowed to make appearances in those games at the time. But with the new bylaws coming down the pipeline, we picked UCLA athletes who could be enrolled in school come next year.  The NCAA's group of advisors claimed Wednesday that group licensing for video games would involve legal hurdles that will be difficult to address, but the people's voices have been heard: They want these games back as soon as possible.

Sophomore quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson is not the best athlete returning to the gridiron in the fall, when it hopefully comes back. His injury and turnover problems have hindered his progress at times during his UCLA career.  However, when he is at his best, Thompson-Robinson is the definition of an electric player, which is exactly the type of athlete that deserves to be on the cover of NCAA Football.  Look at his game against Washington State in October  one of the biggest comebacks in UCLA football history. Staring down a 32-point deficit with just over 22 minutes of game clock left, the Bruins looked like they were leaving Pullman with another defeat.  Thompson-Robinson, however, dug deep, outdueling Cougar quarterback Anthony Gordon to pull out the 67-63 road win. He ended the night with 507 passing yards and five passing touchdowns to go along with 57 yards and two touchdowns on the ground, giving him the school record for total offensive yards in a game.  While he may not have the Heisman hype or NFL Draft status of Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence, Thompson-Robinson has the big game potential and explosiveness that could wind up on the cover of the next video game.

Who better to represent the sport than one of the game's brightest young stars?  Sabrina Ionescu and the rest of Oregon's top stars have gone pro, which means junior forward Michaela Onyenwere could be the biggest name in the West come next season.  Onyenwere was a Third Team All-American this year, and espnW ranked her as the third-best women's basketball player returning to school next season. Her averages of 19.1 points and 8.6 rebounds per game led UCLA in 2019-2020, and her role in coach Cori Close's offense should continue to grow with guard Japreece Dean and her 13.5 points per game heading to the WNBA.  What also helps Onyenwere's marketability is the fact that she's the go-to star player on one of the nation's new top teams in UCLA. Historic powerhouses UConn, Notre Dame and Baylor don't have any All-Americans returning to school, meaning EA Sports could look toward Westwood for their first-ever women's basketball cover athlete.  Add in the fact that Onyenwere was pining for a spot on Team USA for 3x3 competition at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, and she seems like the perfect well-rounded player to sell units and best represent her sport next season.

No one represents the joy of playing soccer more than Mia Fishel.  The UCLA womens soccer forward entered her freshman season with a bang, scoring either a goal or logging an assist in each of her first three games.  But what stands out most about Fishels first-ever collegiate goal  a half volley that spun into the left side netting  was  the ensuing jubilation  written all over her face as she screamed with excitement, flexed her arms and leaped for her teammates.  Every beat photographer started paying a little extra attention to Fishel after that day, waiting to capture another moment like that. And they got what they hoped for.  By the end of the season, Fishel tallied a team-high 14 goals  scoring on 20% of the shots she took and making her the third-top freshman in scoring in the nation behind two players who each scored 15 goals.  Fishel has also proven herself to be one of the fastest players in the country and has the footwork to back it up, giving her an ideal skill set for a video game character in addition to undoubtedly the best celebration selection.  Though she has already built a name for herself as a member of the U.S. Women's National Team youth system, scoring 13 goals in the 2020 CONCACAF U-20 qualifiers  an all-time record  Fishel still has three more years of collegiate eligibility to be the face of NCAA womens soccer.  And her face, filled with intensity and passion, is bound to get anyone excited about the game.   Zach Pettway  ""NCAA Baseball 21""   Jared Tay, assistant Sports editor   [caption id=""attachment_379351"" align=""alignright"" width=""225""]    (Photo Illustration by Alice Naland/Daily Bruin staff and Callista Wu/Design Director)[/caption]  It's about time a pitcher was the cover athlete for a baseball game.  Since the inception of Sony's MLB The Show franchise in 1998  largely the only baseball simulation game for the major and minor leagues  a pitcher has never been featured as the cover athlete on the U.S. release of the game.  MLB The Show's cover has been graced by the likes of the Philadelphia Phillies' Bryce Harper, the Detroit Tigers' Miguel Cabrera and the Boston Red Sox's David Ortiz. But never a top arm.  So if there ever is an NCAA baseball video game, it's only fair that the inaugural installment of the franchise should correct this wrong and feature one of the best hurlers in college baseball.  As UCLA baseball's Friday night starter in 2020, junior right-hander Zach Pettway tallied a team-best 1.05 ERA among starters, winning three out of his four starts before the Bruins' season was cut short.  Along the way, Pettway logged 29 strikeouts, fanning 13 batters in one night against Saint Mary's on Feb. 21. His success on the mound earned him the top spot in D1 Baseball's junior pitcher rankings, indicating Pettway is one of the top arms on the collegiate stage.  Most impressive, however, has been Pettway's bounce back from injury in 2019. Missing both the month of May and June in 2019 because of a forearm strain, Pettway's ability to recover and continue his dominance as the Bruins' ace has drawn praise from both coach John Savage and his teammates.  A true comeback kid, with one of the strongest performances throughout the shortened 2020 season, Pettway deserves more than anyone to be the face of college baseball in homes across the country.   Nia Dennis  ""NCAA Women's Gymnastics 21""   Coral Smith, assistant Sports editor   [caption id=""attachment_379352"" align=""alignright"" width=""225""]    (Photo Illustration by Tanmay Shankar/Assistant Photo editor and Callista Wu/Design Director)[/caption]  Every good video game cover athlete needs a signature pose.  And for Nia Dennis, that move actually involves signing her name in the air.  Just like her former teammate Katelyn Ohashi in 2018 and 2019, the UCLA gymnastics junior has become one of the most recognizable gymnasts of the 2020 season after her Beyonc-inspired floor routine went viral in February.  With other high-profile gymnasts such as UCLA senior Kyla Ross and Oklahoma's Maggie Nichols finishing their final collegiate seasons, Dennis is poised to be the most recognizable face returning to college gymnastics next year, making her a perfect candidate to be the first gymnastics cover athlete.  In addition to her internet-shattering floor routine, which garnered a 9.975 from the judges, Dennis collected five other floor scores above a 9.900 in 2020. As a reoccurring presence as the leadoff competitor in the vault lineup as well, the junior's consistency resulted in an average score of 9.863 over the course of the season.  Unlike other gymnasts who specialize in just one or two events, Dennis has recent experience excelling on all four events. In the last two years alone, Dennis has regularly competed in all four rotations and has scored a 9.950 or higher on each of them.  Dennis's fame and all-around talent make her the ideal cover athlete for this first NCAA gymnastics video game.  And her 190,000 Instagram followers would probably agree.","['cap-jack-perez', 'cap-sam-connon', 'cap-jacqueline-dzwonczyk', 'cap-jared-tay', 'cap-coral-smith']","['baseball', 'football', 'gymnastics', 'sports', 'sports-columns', 'womens-basketball', 'womens-soccer']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/video-games.jpg

Because of this, one may have missed the recent unfolding of a series of events in Washington D.C. that could change the future of elections in the United States.   On May 13, the Supreme Court heard the final arguments in a case to determine whether states can take punitive action against &#8220;faithless&#8221; electors, or electors who choose not to vote for the candidate that won their state's popular vote in a presidential election.  When the Supreme Court makes its decision, it will impact the role of electors and clarify one of the many anomalies found within the U.S. electoral system; thus, it is worth taking a look at the different opinions on the issue and each of their respective implications.      To begin, the cases presented   before the Supreme Court,  Chiafalo v. Washington  and  Colorado Department of State v. Baca , involve electors from Washington state and Colorado who were fined or replaced for not voting according to their state's popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. These faithless electors claim that states do not possess the power to take such punitive actions, while others claim that the 10th Amendment specifically reserves such powers for the state.  But before we dive into specific arguments about the power of states and electors, it may be helpful to brush up on the Electoral College itself, as well as its current operation and recent controversies.    The Electoral College, or   the body that formally elects the president following the   general election, is established by  Article II, Section 1  of the U.S. Constitution. Because of this part of the Constitution, when citizens cast their ballots in November, they are actually deciding which electors will vote on their behalf   on   Jan. 6. Electors are often appointed by each candidates&#8217; political party; however, the specifics of this process  vary by state .  Under the Constitution, electors are granted the ability to award their state&#8217;s electoral votes to a candidate other than the winner of the state's popular vote. While this may seem undemocratic by today's standards, in 1787, many of the Founding Fathers   believed that this measure was   necessary   to prevent unqualified or potentially dangerous candidates from swaying the opinion of uneducated voters and taking office.   [Related:    The Quad: Voting rights have expanded in the past 100 years, but barriers still exist ]     Today, 32 states, including California, require electors to vote for the candidate selected by their state's popular vote.   Since the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly prohibit states from creating such requirements,  the 10th Amendment  generally leaves specific decisions about electors to the individual state governments.   However, even though these requirements exist in state laws, 17 of these states have no measures in place to penalize or to   prevent electors from breaking these requirements and casting their vote for a candidate that did not win their state's popular vote.   California is one of these states whose bark is often bigger than its bite.   For example, the &#8220;faithless&#8221; vote in the aforementioned state   will not be counted and the elector will be replaced, but there are no additional punishments to dissuade electors from &#8220;going rogue.""  Although the chances that faithless electors alter the outcome of a presidential election are slim, many citizens   nonetheless fear the potential consequences of allowing such free agents.   During the May 13   Supreme Court hearing, Justice Clarence Thomas  raised the       possibility  that electors in some states could vote for fictional characters, such as Frodo Baggins, without repercussions. Though comical, the implications of this argument are much more noteworthy.    Additionally, others in the hearing expressed concerns over outside influences that could impact electors.     Justice Samuel Alito expressed his fear that the losing political party could try to influence electors after the November election, resulting in months of uncertainty and raising questions about the legitimacy of a president elected by appointed party members rather than the American people.  Adding to Alito's concerns of domestic influence, Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued in the hearing that foreign governments could potentially try to blackmail electors to undermine U.S. presidential elections.  However, this debate, like most, is not one-sided.     Some proponents of unpledged electors,   or electors that can diverge from their state&#8217;s popular vote, claim that electors have a responsibility to prevent dangerous leaders from rising to power, even when their state votes for them. Lawrence Lessig, the lawyer representing the faithless electors in the Supreme Court case, argued in the hearing   that electors have a moral and political obligation to use their own discretion when deciding how to vote.  UCLA political science lecturer Ajax Peris said that giving state governments the power to dictate how electors vote could enable the state   legislatures to influence election results.  ""There's a concern that if the court rules that states do have this power to compel electors, that perhaps a state legislature could manipulate the results of an election by changing the rules and forcing an outcome different from the popular vote,"" Peris said. ""This seems pretty unlikely even if it's theoretically possible.""  This existing freedom for electors has faced greater scrutiny after the 2016 presidential election, in which 10 electors opted to cast votes inconsistent with their state's popular vote. Although still a negligible amount in terms of the 538 total electors, many believe that faithless electors' efforts to alter the outcome of the election may   indicate their potential to undermine the democracy of the U.S.  However, Peris noted that this potential is still incredibly small.  ""It seems highly unlikely that faithless electors will pose a threat to our elections,"" Peris said. ""Faithless electors are rare for a reason, and it seems impossible except in the closest of election outcomes that enough faithless electors would be able to agree to change the result. A faithless vote is more likely a way to make a statement than an attempt to sway the outcome.""  Although many, including Peris, contend that the ability of faithless electors to seriously disrupt elections is quite small, others believe this issue may lead to more chaos than it is credited for.  For example, Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued in the hearing that the judicial system should avoid endorsing any scenario,   such as permitting faithless electors, that could lead to widespread disorder as a result of general uncertainty about the outcome of presidential elections. In other words, if electors are able to ignore their state's popular vote without consequence, the results of the election as determined in November would be of questionable significance &#8211; especially if it were close.   In line with arguments such as this, many states are now attempting to address the danger that faithless electors could hypothetically pose to democratic elections. The question, however, is whether these state actions are constitutional.  As mentioned above, the 10th Amendment has been interpreted in different ways in regard to states' control over their electors. The 10th Amendment may allow states to create requirements for their electors, but the Supreme Court will decide whether it enables states to punish or remove electors for disobeying.   In the event that the Supreme Court rules in favor of Washington state and Colorado, California could attempt to pass more punitive measures to discourage or to prevent their 55 electors from casting faithless votes. However, it may be important to note that California has never had a faithless elector in past presidential elections.  Additionally, the Supreme Court's decision could influence the implementation of a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an attempt by some states to circumvent the Electoral College. According to the  proposed bill , states in the compact would give their electoral votes to the candidate that won the nationwide popular vote, regardless of their state popular vote. California is among the 15 states that have already passed the bill; however, the bill requires 74 additional electoral votes before it can take effect.   Nevertheless, if the Supreme Court rules in favor of faithless electors, states in the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact would be unable to compel their electors to vote for the nationwide winner.    Regardless of the final ruling, expected sometime this summer,   the Electoral College system that has puzzled college students and political pundits alike for the past 232 years will continue to govern presidential elections for the time being &#8211; even if it undergoes some modification.  Thus, in the midst of great uncertainty about the future of many other aspects of the lives of Americans, there is one college that is sure to be open: the Electoral College.

Some students are staying in the United States instead of going home to their families, amid fears of being barred from reentering the U.S.  Anna Bonazzi, an international student from Italy, and her husband are one of many families unable to go home this year.   &#8220;When the lockdowns started, (students) were worried,&#8221; said Bonazzi, a graduate student in Germanic languages. &#8220;(If you&#8217;re) here, and something happens at home, you&#8217;re in a bad position, because you can&#8217;t go home to see your family.&#8221;  If international students do choose to go home, obtaining a new visa to return to America is nearly impossible because embassies and consulates are closed, said Sam Nahidi, the director of the UCLA Dashew Center for International Students and Scholars, in an emailed statement.  Merely staying in the country doesn&#8217;t solve all of the international students&#8217; problems, though. Changing federal and university policies have made students&#8217; visa statuses, finances and job prospects increasingly uncertain.  Most of the international graduating business students who did leave the country weren&#8217;t planning to work in the U.S., and they knew they probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to come back, said Angela Arunarsirakul, a graduate business student.  &#8220;The (students) who would&#8217;ve liked to have gone home didn&#8217;t go because they were worried that they wouldn't be able to come back,&#8221; Arunarsirakul said. &#8220;You never know, ... all of a sudden your country might be on (Trump&#8217;s) travel ban list.&#8221;  International graduate students&#8217; concerns don&#8217;t just end with visa uncertainties; many are facing financial hardships as well.  International graduate students are usually ineligible for state and federal aid, said Letty Trevi&#241;o, the 2020-2021 Graduate Students Association vice president of academic affairs.   Some graduate students &#8211; who were already facing  financial hardships  before the coronavirus outbreak began &#8211; must now consider spending an extra quarter at UCLA to complete their degree.  The coronavirus outbreak has halted research in laboratories and delayed some humanities research, which could force some graduate students to stay at UCLA longer, Trevi&#241;o said.  The approximately $15,000 annual UCLA Nonresident Supplemental Tuition fee is a large financial strain for international graduate students, Trevi&#241;o said.  &#8220;We can&#8217;t pay that out of pocket &#8211; graduate students don&#8217;t have that money,&#8221; Trevi&#241;o said.  Teaching undergraduate classes is one of the main sources of income for many graduate students. While UCLA has extended the time graduate students may stay enrolled at UCLA, the university has not extended the time graduate students can work as teaching assistants, Trevi&#241;o said.  The NRST fee is normally waived for three years for doctoral students in the final stage of their degree process. The university has not extended the length of the fee waiver for students who choose to stay at UCLA longer, however, which may render students unable to afford to stay at UCLA, Trevi&#241;o said.  &#8220;If you&#8217;re not giving an extra year of fee waiver, ... then giving (international graduate students) an extra quarter doesn&#8217;t mean anything,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They can technically stay here, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they can pay for it.&#8221;  Delaying graduation also hurts graduate students&#8217; job applications.  Graduate students face challenges applying to teaching positions, since university hiring cycles won&#8217;t wait for graduate students whose graduation is delayed a quarter, Trevi&#241;o said.  Some graduate students&#8217; job and internship offers were rescinded as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, Arunarsirakul said. Internships often lead to full-time employment offers, which are especially important for international students, Arunarsirakul added.  Many companies ordinarily avoid hiring international students because of legal uncertainties, Arunarsirakul said. Coronavirus-related hiring freezes have further exacerbated the problems for graduate students, Arunarsirakul added.  &#8220;(Your dream company) might not hire international students (at all),&#8221; Arunarsirakul said. &#8220;(Some companies) don't want to go through the process of the legal paperwork and ... the uncertainty of the risks that come with hiring an international student.""  Campus career centers should help international students identify which jobs to apply to and provide additional resources available to them, Arunarsirakul said.  The UCLA Anderson School of Management&#8217;s career center is providing access to international job search databases and informational interview workshops, according to an Anderson spokesperson.  Graduate students who choose to stay in the country also face challenges in ensuring they can remain in the U.S. after their degree is complete.  The federal government has lifted some student visa restrictions because of the coronavirus outbreak. International students are usually not allowed to take all online classes, but this rule has been lifted, Nahidi said in an emailed statement.  After graduation, the federal Optional Practical Training program allows international students to stay in the country. Normally, this program would allow international students like Tarun Rai Madan, a graduate business student, to stay in the U.S. for three more years after their degrees are complete.  The Dashew Center usually processes OPT applications on behalf of graduate students. But because of the coronavirus outbreak, students like Madan must now submit their applications to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services directly.  &#8220;The current biggest concern people are having is whether their OPT applications will be approved,&#8221; Madan said.  Moreover, the OPT program requires international students to find a job within 90 days to stay in the country.  Many international students in the U.S. intend to remain in the country after graduating, but the threat of a coronavirus-induced recession threatens job security, Arunarsirakul said.  &#8220;The idea is that (international students) would have some (work) experience, even if it&#8217;s just for a year,&#8221; Arunarsirakul said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s really getting people to question, &#8216;Was the investment worth it?&#8217;&#8221;  Students pay a premium for graduate business programs because of the professional networking opportunities that are available with in-person learning, but a lot of that value has been lost in the transition to online learning, Madan said.  ""Most of us (international students) have over $100,000 in loans and (are struggling to get a job),&#8221; Madan said. &#8220;Obviously there is that question ... whether this whole thing is worth it, whether it is worth taking up such a big looming burden only (to have to) go back.&#8221;   The Enterprise team wants to cover stories that our readers care about.

The investigator, Natasha Baker, released a report in early May analyzing sexual misconduct allegations against Kieffer and did not find that a ""preponderance of the evidence"" supported the claim.     Rebecca Ora, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student,    publicly accused    Kieffer of sexual misconduct during the public comment section at a UC Board of Regents meeting in November. Ora, who was then the external vice president of the UC Santa Cruz Graduate Student Association, said Kieffer repeatedly grasped her thigh at a dinner discussing tuition increases in 2014.    Ora also called for Kieffers resignation at the meeting.    Baker evaluated Oras allegation by using the four factors enforced by the U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to determine the credibility of such claims: plausibility, motive to falsify, corroboration and past record of similar behavior.&nbsp;    Baker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;    Ora initially used legal mediation for her case, but when it failed, she filed a request for the UC to conduct a formal investigation.&nbsp;    Ora did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;    Ora said in the November regents meeting that she was excluded from committees because of Kieffers presence, fell behind on academics, and experienced panic attacks following the filing of her case.   UC spokesperson Claire Doan said the regents decided to investigate the claims after learning of the allegations against Kieffer. The independent investigator followed the UCs Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy and the regents policy for misconduct, she added.  Doan declined to provide the report or comment further, citing privacy laws.","['cap-kari-lau', 'cap-saumya-gupta']","['news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/kieffer-breaking-1.jpg

[caption id=""attachment_379480"" align=""alignright"" width=""300""]  Council members were evaluated in these areas on a scale from one to five, with one being poor performance and five being excellent performance.[/caption]  Regarding the undocumented student population, Guerra Martinez was able to finish campaigns with student organizations at UCLA before winter quarter ended, tied with work done with Undergraduate Students Association Council and a coalition of undocumented student organizations on campus to offer students paid work responsibilites. Her office served as an ally pushing for budget priorities and additional funding provided by the state for undocumented sutdents, foster youth and system impact groups.  Guerra Martinez was  absent  from USAC council meetings for two weeks after not receiving pay as she lost her status as a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program on Jan. 1 and her DACA employment authorization was not renewed. She said it was a difficult time choosing to not work as a volunteer and although USAC was able to offer the rest of her stipend through surplus, she said it was hard to ask her friends for pay knowing that those dollars were originally a part of student fees.  It hurts any representative to miss meetings, especially the external vice president. However, she was able to serve as an example for other undocumented students as a student leader without documented status.  Her work with AFSCME saw success through the push through student government for the ACA-14 legislation against the University of California to prevent them from outsourcing which passes. Continued allyship and training to support the labor union also continued throughout the year.  Basic needs advocacy was another important platform for Guerra Martinez, but it ended up being one of the most disappointing aspects of her tenure. Many offices work for basic needs funding, but most of the funding is controlled through the Basic Needs Committee.  Guerra Martinez found it difficult to work with the Basic Needs Committee and that the struggles stemmed from them being an unwelcoming meeting space and anti-USAC  so that even members of her office assigned to basic needs were discouraged from interaction and were restricted in their roles.  From the get-go she was not able to oversee how basic needs funding was going and was unable to push for her initiatives due to an inability to meet with the committee  such that her first meeting with them was Week 10 of fall quarter and funding closed at the end of that week. Being out of control on your own campus did not help Guerra Martinez and the work she did through USAC and not on the ground at UCLA.  Overall, the leader of the EVP office was able to work on the level of the greater UC as well as in California. But prior external vice presidents have been able to tap into the campus on the day to day and extend into the surrounding Westwood community.  Guerra Martinez certainly had the legislative background and it is all well and good to say that change was made on the higher levels. But more work was needed on the local level at UCLA  with specific solutions to issues that the campus faced more broadly.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.Johana.LK_.jpg

The Shenanigans Comedy Club at UCLA is adapting to social distancing orders to keep their audiences, and each other, laughing. Members from each department &#8211; which include stand-up, sketch, improv and digital sketch &#8211;  have stayed committed and meet on a weekly basis as the club continues to upload content online, said club president Akila Rajesh. However, Rajesh said their online event turn out is much larger than their usual in person events.  &#8220;I think people have more free time now so they're able to come to (our meetings),&#8221; Rajesh said. &#8220;It's also easier because you don't have to walk anywhere.&#8221;   [Related:    Creatives continue to create through entertainment industry&#8217;s pause amid pandemic   ]    The live Zoom stand-up performances average about 10 club members performing for four minutes each. Rajesh said the format of the hour-long show gives performers a chance to use new comedic material they wrote for their performance or refine and test out some past favorites.  After restrictions were put into place as a response to the pandemic, she said the club is fortunate to continue delivering comedy via online platforms, compared to other campus organizations that rely heavily on physical collaboration. The online stand-up events have attracted an average of 50 audience members on Zoom which is more than their usual in-person events, Rajesh said.   Although attendance has benefited from live-streamed performances, the online format is   a comic&#8217;s nightmare, said co-head of the stand-up department, Michael Pile. Perhaps one of the biggest issues performers now face is not being able to hear the reaction of audience members, he said. This has led Pile to experiment with certain decisions like whether to keep everyone muted or giving audience members the ability to unmute themselves. Ultimately, Pile said playing around with the settings will help mitigate some of the awkwardness of trying to attempt stand-up comedy alone on a laptop in a bedroom.  ""We want to improve our craft and be better comedians, and it's pretty hard to do that,"" Pile said. ""Did it go over well?, how can I improve? &#8211; that kind of information that you get (from the environment) is lacking, but we still have an opportunity to show off what we've been working on.""   [Related:    UCLA&#8217;s first ballet company a safe haven for pli&#233;s, d&#233;gag&#233;s and fun   ]    However, the digital sketch department, where members write, act out and record sketches for the sole purpose of being uploaded online, are also facing their own array of challenges, said   incoming president Jessica Block. The third-year linguistics and psychology student said their sketches are typically filmed in-person, and they have now been uploading their previously recorded sketches. Recently, they uploaded their first sketch made entirely on Zoom titled ""Socksame Street"" on YouTube where Rajesh can be seen as the judge for various sock puppets auditioning for a role on Sesame Street.  As the club runs low on their surplus of prerecorded material, Rajesh said they are also brainstorm ways to record their sketches to maintain an online presence. She said this includes recording the sketches individually and making stories out of screen recordings.  &#8220;(Screen recorded stories) are stories that don't necessarily take place in the physical world and more so on a laptop or through text messages,&#8221; Rajesh said. &#8220;I think that kind of story is something that's going to be more popular because of the way the world is heading in terms of people living their lives online.&#8221;  Meanwhile, the improv branch of the comedy club has been solely focusing on performing and providing feedback for each other during the pandemic, but Block said that changes May 19. Their upcoming show, titled &#8220;Men Aren&#8217;t Funny,"" will be the first online Zoom performance from the club&#8217;s improv team in collaboration with the stand-up team. This all-women show is one of the most widely attended events of the club, and Block said her purpose in launching the show was to highlight women's contribution to the stand-up industry.   Although men won't be participating in the show, there will be many more opportunities for all members, she said. More Zoom events are scheduled throughout the rest of Spring quarter, and the club plans to keep performing on Zoom until restrictions are lifted. Regardless of the difficulties presented by the online format, however, Rajesh said the high attendance paints a hopeful future for the comedy club as members continue to improve their craft.    &#8220;This is the time when you need clubs more than anything,&#8221; Rajesh said. &#8220;I'm really glad (our club is) still running because it's more than a comedy club &#8211; it's a group of friends that you get to see and talk about funny things with.&#8221;  ",['cap-aaron-untiveros'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.shenaniganscomedy.TS_.jpg

In his seventh studio album, the artist maintains his trademark piano-driven pop and soul instrumentals while evolving lyrically   to reflect his growing relationships. Following his 2016 hip-hop-based album Darkness and Light, Legends return to love ballads and dreamy vocals yields an uplifting summer soundtrack sprinkled with reggaeton and bumping beats. Despite a few tracks getting caught up in repetitive melodies, the 16-song album highlights his undyingly honest love for those around him and his optimistic view of life.  Opening with Ooh Laa, Legend welcomes listeners by showing off his impressive vocal range with high-pitched falsettos and swaying melodies. The old-time jazz piano roots his instrumentals and is reminiscent of what he does best, while the added layer of hip-hop beats and doo-wop vocals make it clear that he is   experimenting with his sound as an artist.     Despite Legend's tremendous success as a singer-songwriter, he is still capable of reflecting upon and criticizing his own work as he moves into ""Actions."" The track's repetitive chorus teasingly mocks his discography as he sings Actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs/ I've been doing it all wrong. The lyrics hint at Legends infamous love song All of Me, the quintessential first dance song with over 1 billion Spotify streams.   [Related:    Album review: The Weeknd authentically portrays heartache over past heartbreak in After Hours   ]     But even after a promising beginning, the album unfortunately falls flat with the slightly forgettable lyrics and repetitive melodies of I Do.   Thankfully, he redeems the track's slip-up in the subsequent songs that celebrate the adventures of love and life to a dance pop beat. One Life features luscious background harmonization and flowing guitar instrumentals that gradually intensify to match the building levels of vocals as he chants one life throughout the chorus.  Reaching the title track of the album, Bigger Love,"" with its catchy chorus, is sure to become a radio hit. The bright, reggaeton song feels as though it's made for the current moment of civil unrest as Legend belts, The world feels like it's crumbling/ Everyday, another new something. In fact, the album itself is fittingly released on Juneteenth    a day commemorating the end of slavery in the United States  as Legend only features Black guest artists.  Jhen Aiko's precise vocal dexterity in U Move, I Move relaxes the album into an R&amp;B style, setting the track as the most sonically advanced as the two artists navigate through melodies that match their harmonious lyrics. Legend and Aiko's voices beautifully melt together as they raise and lower, singing I'll follow you up and over as well as change their paces with You control me, fast and slow.   Such masterful vocal control and purposeful lyricism prove why Legend deserves his 11 Grammy Awards that sit among his Emmy, Oscar and Tony.  But the album takes a turn with three lyrically forgettable   tracks that are   also the most sensual of the album, featuring horn, piano and guitar instrumentals that support Legend's suggestive vocals. Luckily, Conversations in the Dark redeems the dull second half of the album with nostalgic melodies from his 2013 release You &amp; I (Nobody in the World)."" Legend successfully raises the bar of his iconic love songs with this realistic and mature ballad as simplistic instrumentals mesh together to spotlight his earnest   promise: ""That I wont break your heart.   [Related:    Album review: Niall Horan departs from typical acoustic ballads in emotional narrative record   ]   As the album progresses with Remember Us, violins guide Legends lovely lyrics of remembering and cherishing sweet moments of a romantic relationship. The lush vocals interweave into a rap by Rapsody, anchored with a bouncy piano   and giving a refreshing feature to the already standout track. Rapsody even references both Kobe Bryant and Nipsey Hussle    two icons who recently passed away  as she creates positive memories from tragic losses with her old-school R&amp;B style.    At last, Legend comes full circle with his closing tracks by returning to his roots that epitomize all that he is adored for: his bumping beats, belting vocals and tender lyrics. Bare instrumentals in Always amplify his vocal range as he opens and closes the song by addressing his wife, singing Hey, love/ My first love/ My last love."" Concluding with Never Break, the groovy track leaves one thing clear  Legend loves being in love and he conveys it masterfully.  In its entirety, the love ballads within Bigger Love provide the comfort longtime Legend fans crave while simultaneously illuminating his melodic songwriting genius. After a four-year hiatus, the album succeeds at what Legend does best but also expands his comfort zone beyond his classic piano beats.",['cap-yasmin-madjidi'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.ae_.johnlegend.review.jpg

Daniel Kamei, a bioengineering professor at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, supervised two doctoral students who founded Phase Scientific along with Kamei and UCLA professor Benjamin Wu. The company recently developed a novel technique for the liquid-phase extraction of RNA, which can process a greater portion of RNA in a sample from a potential COVID-19 patient than the standard solid-phase extraction method of testing.  RNA, or ribonucleic acid, contains a unique set of genetic instructions for each virus. COVID-19 testing kits extract RNA from a patient sample and analyze it for distinct COVID-19 RNA, Kamei said. Liquid-phase extraction, or LPE, can process a greater portion of RNA contained in a prepared sample than solid-phase extraction, or SPE, which is currently the method of RNA extraction in standard COVID-19 testing kits.  The SPE kit produces an extracted sample, called an elution, with a low concentration of viral RNA for analysis, so the concentration threshold to detect the presence of COVID-19 can be very difficult to meet, said Felix Chao, a founding team member at Phase Scientific and a UCLA alumnus.  The LPE method allows for a low volume of the elution, increasing its RNA concentration, which helps subsequent testing procedures to more accurately identify patients with COVID-19, Chao said.  The new technique can enable a final viral RNA concentration on average 15 times greater than when using SPE, Chao said.  Garrett Mosley, head of research and development at Phase Scientific and a UCLA alumnus, said solid surface extraction is more susceptible to contamination and patient-to-patient sample variability, both of which can prevent target RNA from being bound to the solid surface during the extraction procedure.  The SPE method requires a large elution volume to release extracted RNA from the solid surface, Mosley said. Extracted RNA does not attach to liquid surfaces, so LPE can produce a much more concentrated elution.  Higher concentrations of RNA can reduce the number of amplification cycles &#8211; which are used to enrich the elution for analysis &#8211; that are required to detect the target virus, thereby increasing the sensitivity of detecting a patient with COVID-19, Chao said.  LPE is a versatile technique that can work with different biomarkers to identify different targets. Therefore, the company was able to quickly direct its resources to develop a new testing kit for COVID-19, Chao said.  Chao mentioned the company had been working on cancer diagnosis using LPE, before the outbreak of the pandemic.  &#8220;We have been working on cancer liquid biopsy to improve the recovery of target DNA, before the outbreak,&#8221; Chao said. &#8220;We took our know-how and technology from DNA to RNA.&#8221;  To successfully adapt the LPE technique, the researchers had to overcome technical hurdles such as changing from plasma samples to naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples, breaking down the layer of fat encasing the viral RNA, and the nuanced chemical differences between DNA and RNA, said Mosley.  The new test kit can be used almost the same way as the current SPE test kits, Mosley said, and medical labs can integrate the new test kit into their workflow without much difficulty.  The extraction kits have been validated by hospitals in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the pandemic, Chao said.  LPE-based extraction kits can increase the overall COVID-19 testing capacity as the significant shortage of RNA extraction kits is a big issue for the current pandemic response, Kamei said.

Ladder-rank or tenure-track faculty are prioritized for faculty housing over appointees in the clinical professor series, adjunct professor series and lecturers at UCLA. This means faculty with lower ranks, who are generally paid less, are given less priority on a waitlist that can reach up to 200 spots for housing intended to be affordable.  &#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult for people who are at the lower end of the salary scale to afford to live anywhere close to UCLA,&#8221; said Toby Higbie, chair of the labor studies department. &#8220;And I think people have a tough time getting (into faculty housing). There's not enough.&#8221;  The Hilgard Faculty Housing  project , which would add up to 100 units to UCLA&#8217;s existing 189 units of faculty housing around Westwood, aims to offer rent at least 30% below the market rate, according to UCLA media relations. Such housing is more affordable than the average rent in Westwood, an area with the fourth-highest rent in the nation, according to a 2019  study .  Caroline Luce, associate director of the Alan D. Leve Center for Jewish Studies, said she spends more than 30% of her income on housing. She said she knows others that spend up to half of their incomes.  Those numbers, said Luce, who is also a member of the University Council-American Federation of Teachers organizing committee, are even more precarious when the average nontenured faculty member is making less than $20,000 a year.  &#8220;We do have a cost of living adjustment in our contract, but it is certainly out of pace with the price of housing in Los Angeles,&#8221; Luce said. &#8220;The housing crisis and skyrocketing rents are rippling down and making it harder and harder and harder every year for nontenured faculty to survive, frankly, and to live in this very expensive city.&#8221;  The housing project is intended to improve faculty recruitment and retention  rates . A majority of respondents in a 2018 survey of UCLA faculty said housing costs and proximity to campus were either &#8220;very important&#8221; or &#8220;important&#8221; factors in their choice to accept or continue employment at UCLA.  Luce said she has friends who work at UCLA who are planning to begin looking for new jobs because they are struggling to raise their families in Westwood.  Higbie was initially placed on the waiting list when he first applied for faculty housing after accepting a position at the university in 2007, and he secured a spot before he moved to California. A lot of faculty housing is not necessarily suited for families, who often need below-market-rate housing the most, Higbie said.  &#8220;We decided at that time we had little kids, and it was a little hard to live in Westwood with two little kids, hauling them down to the park and now that kind of stuff,&#8221; Higbie said. &#8220;So we moved down to a rental house in Rancho Park so we could have a backyard.&#8221;  Tenured and tenure-track faculty are generally paid more than lecturers, but affording a house in Los Angeles on a single salary is difficult no matter what job a faculty member has, Higbie said.  The ability for faculty to live close to campus is not only beneficial for faculty, but also for students, Higbie said.  &#8220;(Faculty) get to talk to (students) outside of the classroom,&#8221; Higbie said. &#8220;And then you build relationships, and that's really what you want in a great university.&#8221;  Luce said she thinks efforts to construct more faculty housing are not enough on their own to address the difficulties that faculty face.  &#8220;On some level, it does come down to how much money is in people's pockets,&#8221; Luce said.  The issue of underpayment is present across the board, including graduate students and members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, an employee union representing over 25,000 service and patient care employees, Luce said.  &#8220;To me, this sounds like a really ripe opportunity for solidarity and for all of us to really work together to encourage the UC to compensate us (for our work),&#8221; Luce said.  Luce acknowledged that the compensation they are asking for must come from somewhere and requires pressure from a greater collection of people.  &#8220;If we want to educate young people in this state to be the leaders and good citizens of tomorrow, we need to value public education, we need to value the teachers and graduate students and food service workers who create the campuses where that education is being given,&#8221; Luce said.  Construction on the Hilgard Faculty Housing project is expected to commence in the summer.

The board discussed the coronavirus outbreak, potential fall plans and funding, and it also voted on the use of standardized testing during the meeting.   Tuesday    Finance and Capital Strategies Committee   The regents approved an additional $20.2 million to the partial preliminary plans funding for the Irvine Campus Medical Complex. This would allow the campus to complete a schematic design for its new hospital.  The regents approved $23.2 million in preliminary funding for the Mission Bay East Campus at UC San Francisco.  The regents approved $3 million in preliminary plan funding for the planning and design of the Integrated Center for Design and Construction at Parnassus Heights, which will be part of the UCSF campus.  The regents approved an additional $130 million in preliminary plan funding for a new hospital at UCSF Helen Diller Medical Center at Parnassus Heights. The money will also be used to address seismic deficiencies for acute inpatient care and outdated clinical facilities.   Investments Committee   Jagdeep Singh Bachher, chief investment officer of the UC, announced that as of May 18, the UC manages $125 billion in assets. He also said that over the past six years, the UC&#8217;s assets have grown by $27 billion.  Bachher also announced that all $125 billion of the UC&#8217;s assets are fossil-free. At the September regents meeting, he announced that only the endowments were fossil-free.   Special Committee on Basic Needs    The committee discussed what has been done for students still living on campus. The CARES Act emergency grants provide $130 million exclusively for UC students, said Shawn Brick, director of student financial support.  Brick said the UC acknowledges the inability for work study students to work effectively or at all and has continued to pay students. The UC has also made sure that students who withdrew from the spring quarter retained their financial aid, he added.  About 80% of the funds from the CARES Act emergency grants have been delivered to students so far. However, the grant only includes students living in the United States, leaving out undocumented and international students.  Existing funds  have been set aside, as a start to help support these groups.  Academic Senate Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani said graduate students may be unable to afford basic needs such as food and health supplies, and she added that she thinks they should be treated just as well as undergraduate students.   Staff Advisor Kate Klimow said she thinks the UC staff should receive the same benefits as students, such as by providing them with groceries and health care products. She said that UCLA and UC Berkeley have taken the initiative to assist their staff, and added she wants to see a UC-wide push to take better care of the staff that are still keeping the campuses in order.    Wednesday    Board of Regents    During public comment, many students objected to the UC&#8217;s involvement with the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.  UC President Janet Napolitano announced that research labs unrelated to COVID-19 will start to open up.  Juan S&#225;nchez Mu&#241;oz was unanimously approved by the UC Board of Regents to be the next chancellor of UC Merced.  The UC Board of Regents approved a set of principles that are supposed to serve as standards for the UC campuses to help determine their plans for the fall. Once the campuses meet the standards, they will determine whether they should operate remotely or use a hybrid model in the fall.    Health Services Committee   Carrie Byington, executive vice president and head of UC Health, said Californians should prepare for a similar quantity of cases of COVID-19 throughout the summer. She also said she expects to see additional cases in the fall and winter.  Until a vaccine and therapeutics are developed to treat COVID-19, Byington said it is important to promote hand-washing, the tracking of symptoms, social distancing and universal mask-wearing.  Byington said it is going to take a culture of accountability in order to stop the pandemic, through practices such as not coming into work when sick and answering truthfully about symptoms.   Academic and Student Affairs Committee   Michael Brown, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs at the UC, discussed the UC&#8217;s transition to remote learning, which started in March, which was caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  Brown said campuses faced some challenges during the transition to remote learning, such as the inability to use sophisticated instructional tech tools because of the shelter-in-place order, as well as difficulties with transitioning lab and studio courses online and proctoring tests online.  He added that some students are disproportionately affected by their environment during the pandemic. While some students may be thriving, other students may not be performing as well because of a lack of an isolated space to participate in courses, for example.  Regent Peter Guber said he thinks the UC needs to coach teachers on how to instruct online so the curriculum is engaging for students.   Finance and Capital Strategies Committee   Paul Jenny, interim executive vice president and chief financial officer at the UC, said the estimated impact of COVID-19 was $1.2 billion through April 30. He added that the UC does not have any certainty about the pandemic&#8217;s trajectory or its long-term impact on the economy or higher education.  The CARES Act has provided $288 million for UC medical centers and $260 million for emergency grants for students and institutional costs, Jenny said.  Student observer Aidan Arasasingham, government relations chair of the UC Student Association, expressed concern over proposed budget cuts for next year and said that UC students, especially undocumented students and underrepresented students of color, deserve more funding in times of crisis.  The UC Board of Regents voted to approve the fiscal year 2020-2021 budget as a continuing resolution that allows it to be worked on until the July regents meeting, when it will come before the board for a vote.    Governance Committee   The governance committee voted to amend a regent policy to specify procedures on allegations of misconduct involving board members. A three-member regent panel will oversee this process.  The amendment will hold regents to standards expressed in the University&#8217;s Sexual Violence and Sexual Harrassment Policy for handling allegations of sexual misconduct by University employees. Complaints of regent misconduct that fall under the University&#8217;s SVSH policy will go through the Title IX office.  The amendment also specified that complaints of misconduct that do not fall under the University&#8217;s SVSH policy will be overseen by a neutral complaint resolution officer. The complaint resolution officer will be selected by the regent panel to oversee things such as the determination of whether an investigation is appropriate, the selection of an investigator and the recommendation of sanctions. The regent panel may recommend different sanctions and actual sanctions will be imposed by the board.  Committee members expressed concern over whether the amendments give the regents too much power to govern themselves. Student Regent Hayley Weddle added she is concerned whether the revisions will hold the regents accountable, since the amendment will maintain the three-regent panel to oversee matters, and may not provide a fair process for those who submit complaints.  Regent Charlene Zettel said even though the regent panel can recommend different sanctions than those provided by the investigator, the original recommendations will also be presented to the full board, and the ultimate decision of sanction rests with the entire board.  The committee also voted to provide a scholarship of $22,859 for the student regent and the student regent-designate. The scholarship will be adjusted depending on cost of living increases.     Thursday    Board of Regents    Jason Rabinowitz, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 2010, called on the UC to support workers who are putting their lives on the line to work during the COVID-19 crisis. Rabinowitz said this is not the time for layoffs, reductions in pay or other measures that will hurt workers.  Carlos Alarcon, a UC Riverside student and representative for the UC Undocumented Student Coalition, said the UC USC condemns any cuts to the undocumented student community. He said a proposed budget cut, even though it was taken off the agenda, caused a panic among the undocumented student community.  The UC Board of Regents voted to phase out the use of the SAT and ACT in admissions through 2024.    Contributing reports by Olivia Tran, Seth Freitas, Jewelyana Lim and Sharon Zhen.

LAMUN XV is a collegiate Model United Nations conference  a simulated proceeding of the actual United Nations and its varying cabinets and councils. UCLAs conference, LA Model U.N., was the highest- ranked  on the West Coast by Best Delegate, with more than 400 delegates from across the world and an 80-person staff. I was the leader of the 15th installment of LA Model U.N., which was set to be hosted April 23 to 26.  Obviously, LAMUN XV didnt end up happening.  But let's go way back to before I became the secretary-general, before I knew what LA Model U.N. was, let alone was devastated by its cancellation, back to when I was a freshman at UCLA.  I had the usual new student hiccups  not knowing where classrooms were and missing my mom, stepdad and sister.  I eventually faced more than a hiccup  my father was dying. Since I was the only family member in Los Angeles, I spent fall quarter taking an UberPool between Rieber Hall and the intensive care unit of Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank to visit a man, who until September, I didnt even have a memory of living with.  The only thing that salvaged   my abysmal first year was Model U.N.  The friends I made and the distraction of traveling to conferences was exactly what I needed. But while Model U.N. was my comfort, I didn't feel like I was good at it.  Therefore, I was shocked when I made the executive board as the director of logistics at the end of my freshman year.  Slowly, during my sophomore year, as my father miraculously recovered, as I became better at Model U.N. and solidified my friend group, I recovered as well. I spent that year doing what most students do their first year at UCLA: finding myself and a major.                                        View this post on Instagram                                          the MVP of the weekend was Dans beanie    A post shared by   Rachel DuRose  (@racheldurose) on  Feb 18, 2020 at 11:28pm PST         Despite the fact that I was eligible to run for secretary-general of LA Model U.N., I wasnt even considering it until a friend suggested it one day. I was touched that someone I looked up to believed in me and even more touched when I won the election last year.  I planned LA Model U.N. meticulously for nearly a year. With the help of an executive team, I selected and managed a more than 80 person staff, negotiated hotel contracts worth tens of thousands of dollars, edited more than a dozen detailed policy guides and supervised months of preparation and logistics.  I had a strong vision, and for the first time since coming to UCLA, I felt strong myself.  Then COVID-19 came.  When we made the decision to cancel the conference, I felt everything but strong. I knew that my 400-person conference in the scope of a pandemic was a small price to pay to flatten the curve. But no matter how many times I reminded myself of that, I didnt end up feeling any better.  While my LA Model U.N. experience was not perfect, and I often hated Model U.N. as much as I loved it, it was a source of stability in my life. And that was gone all of a sudden.  My conference was over, school was online and my friends were packing up and going home.  Home?  Well, I was born in Los Angeles, grew up in Orlando, Florida, and about a month before the world we knew collapsed, my mom moved to Brooklyn, New York.  I suddenly had to consider multiple scenarios and predicaments.  Do I fly through at least two major airports to go to New York, an epicenter of this virus, where my 60-year old stepfather and mother, the latter   a cancer survivor, live in a small apartment? No, I dont want to risk becoming infected while traveling and then not be able to isolate myself from them. Do I fly to my grandparents' house in North Carolina where my father now lives? No, his health is precarious at best and my grandparents are well over 70. Do I stay with my sister and her boyfriend in her Philadelphia studio with one bed and a bean bag chair? No.  Plus, I still have an apartment in Westwood with $800 rent due and no market for subleasing.  I decided to stay in Westwood, because for some of us, the choice had already been made.  Westwoods now empty streets, compounded with my inability to escape to anywhere else, make this place feel like anything but home.   ""I decided to stay in Westwood, because for some of us, the choice had already been made.""     Now, my anxieties over my student loans and my parents' and my own unemployment are what keep me up at night instead of the nearby parties.  No conference, no family around to give me a hug and no job.  I acknowledge that grieving for experiences rather than lost loved ones during a time like this is a privilege, but it doesnt erase the hurt. And for me, there's a looming feeling that when this all ends, Ill be going right back to square one like at the start of my freshman year, when someone I loved was actually sick.  But we have to remember that this is a different world now. No, I wont ever get my conference and Ill always be jealous of those students who got to go home, but I am grateful.  Grateful that the friends I made in Model U.N. didnt disappear with LA Model U.N. and have supported me through my financial and academic stress. Grateful that I can FaceTime them, my sister, my mom, my dad and my boyfriend.  But more than that, I am grateful that for once, its okay for us to be sad right now.   ""But more than that, I am grateful that for once, its okay for us to be sad right now.""     We have all lost something or someone during this time, and our individual sadnesses do not minimize or detract from each other's losses. So instead, we can all be there for each other, the way the community I found at UCLA has been there for me.

The microscale technology, which can perform blood processing, clinical work-ups, diagnostic testing, biomedical assays, sequence genetic material, and assist in the manufacture and development of pharmaceutical drugs, would eliminate the need for human contact and the risk of exposure to pathogens and chemical mutagens, which are critically harmful to an individual&#8217;s health.  The technology harnesses electromagnetic induction to create streamlined automation with applications in biological and health sciences, according to a  study  published Feb. 26 in Science Robotics.   This mechanization comes in the form of circular, magnetized robots, called ferrobots. The ferrobots can either work independently or communicate with each other to perform tasks on small liquid droplets, which include droplet sorting, dispensing, generation, merging and filtration.  They are also able to move in three dimensional space, allowing for a high degree of specification and production, according to the study.  The ferrobots, which are placed on a notecard-sized chip, are only 2 millimeters across. Using electromagnetic tiles in the chip, the bots can be precisely controlled to perform the droplet-related tasks, as well as multidirectional movements.  Since the tiles generate a magnetic field that can move the droplets, the ferrobots can perform tasks without contact, said Sam Emaminejad, a senior author of the study and assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at UCLA.  The ferrobots can complete a range of designated movements and jobs at a rate of 10 centimeters per second, complete over 10,000 cycles and operate for over 24 hours, according to the study.  &#8220;Because of the robustness of the mechanism, we started thinking about how we could apply it to biomedical applications in the microfluidic field, such as in droplet generation, filtration, dispensing and sequential optical sensing,&#8221; said Haisong Lin, a co-lead author and graduate student at UCLA.  These functions are critical in performing biological assays, which mark specific amounts of genetic material in a given sample, Emaminejad said.  Another advantage to the ferrobots is their ability to carry out calibrated diagnostics. The technology is able to accurately calibrate measurements for error, based on known measurements, and can also normalize readings with these preknown measurements to obtain highly accurate results.  Using this technology, researchers can generate accurate data on millions of compounds, including the biomarkers of debilitating diseases such as cancer, sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction, in a rapid, streamlined setting, Emaminejad said.  The engineers were able to show they could adjust the ferrobots to quantify levels of a class of enzymes known as matrix metallopeptidases, or MMPS, in human plasma.  MMPS are biomarkers indicative of immunological health, according to the study. A heightened level of MMPS is a tell-tale sign of pathophysiological activity in the body, including the onset of sepsis, activation of the immune response and the breakdown of clots that occur during wound healing.  Emaminejad said the motivation behind the study was to develop a less bulky, more streamlined automation for point of care and research settings, so in the future, an ordinary person without any training can test themselves on a regular basis.  As of today, many biotechnological applications use clunky, outdated robots to assist in human and chemical sample analysis, Emaminejad said.  In terms of production, engineers are improving the field by creating progressive, automated advances that are much more cost effective, simplified and tailored to yield more in less time.  &#8220;If you look at the automated information that&#8217;s being processed with computers, whether it&#8217;s logistics or other data, such as used by Amazon.com, that are really into delivery automation, this was one of the things that drove us,&#8221; said Dino Di Carlo, another senior author of the study and a UCLA bioengineering professor. &#8220;The same goes for Uber Eats, where you no longer go to the restaurant, your order comes to you. In these cases it is all about the workflow that brings it all together in a truly seamless and user-friendly platform.&#8221;  The miniature robots could also help improve the output of many biotechnology, manufacturing and pharmaceutical companies that still use large-scale analytics and big robots, Emaminejad said.  &#8220;The cost of a big robot that assembles cars or is used by pharma companies serves its purpose in mass manufacturing, mass output,&#8221; Di Carlo said. &#8220;But let&#8217;s say a research lab might not be able to, and so there&#8217;s this aspect of democratizing the ability to do automated biology experiments.&#8221; ",[],"['news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/image-1.png

In the midst of COVID-19, film and television students are among a subset of those impacted by UCLA&#8217;s transition to a remote spring quarter. Usually reliant on an abundance of screenings and productions to create a full-bodied education, film students must now adjust to the reality of self-isolation and online classes. Victor Rocha, a fourth-year film and television student, said with strict regulations in place, there has been an abrupt halt on the     collaboration and production of films.      ""As heartbreaking as (transitioning to online classes) is, there is no way around that given that UCLA has to take into account the pandemic and the fact that we can't have too many people in one classroom,"" Rocha said.   [Related:    CAP suspends all performances, shifts shows to next season   ]   However, former Daily Bruin contributor Rocha, as co-head of the undergraduate student council for film, said he is planning to conduct many weekly online workshops for professional career development. Focused on resume and cover letter creation, and film and TV writing, Rocha   said he hopes these workshops enhance film students&#8217; spring quarter experiences and provide guidance.   Zoom workshops can supplement students' film classes, particularly film theory courses,   he said. However, teachers are still faced with the challenge of putting together a comprehensive curriculum online, with production, editing and digital media classes among the most difficult to transition. These classes require access to expensive technology and equipment, including the editing and VR labs, which students can't necessarily recreate at home. With the recent closure of the facility this technology is housed in &#8211; Melnitz Hall &#8211; many students are at a loss because they no longer have access to these resources on campus either, Rocha said.   &#8220;Why are we paying so much for film school when the majority of it is now dependent on us to have our own editing software and our own VR headsets?&#8221; Rocha said. &#8220;It feels like we're paying for resources that we don't have access to anymore.&#8221;    With more than 30 isolated editing bays, Rocha said UCLA could implement social distancing rules by having one person working in each bay, allowing students to resume their use of Melnitz's technology. Graduate student Justin Garza   said as these facilities shut down because of COVID-19, the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television needs to ensure students are not being asked to pay for access to unused resources &#8211;   especially in this time of such financial uncertainty.  Students should be able to obtain a refund   on the mandatory professional fees they pay in order to use the editing systems, equipment and facilities exclusive to UCLA, Garza said. Since they can no longer use them for the rest of the quarter, he said it doesn&#8217;t make sense to collect payment as if they were. This isn&#8217;t a problem unique to UCLA&#8217;s film school either, as Garza said many other schools around the globe, including NYU, are discussing not only the professional fees but class structuring as well.    Though COVID-19 greatly impacts Garza's film education, he said there is much more strain on the entertainment industry right now, putting a great number of filmmakers and creatives out of work.    &#8220;The whole entertainment industry, in general, is taking a hit,&#8221; Garza said. &#8220;People I know that work in the field professionally are just talking about how everyone is out of work .  Shows are being stopped, and movies are being stopped. Everything is being stopped.&#8221;   [Related:    Dance Marathon 2020 canceled following COVID-19 concerns   ]   Graduate student Aaron Lemle said it&#8217;s not just   the film students who are devastated by COVID-19 &#8211; they are merely inconvenienced.   It&#8217;s the freelancers who are now unable to afford rent and basic necessities, Lemle said, that are truly in trouble, which makes him more appreciative of his living situation.      &#8220;I think we're all pretty lucky at least most of us have allocated the resources to be in school for the next two or three years,&#8221; Lemle said. &#8220;Whereas a lot of my peers who are not in school are scrambling to figure out how to pay rent now that their freelance job has just dried up.&#8221;    Filmmakers are often accustomed to working under unusual circumstances, Lemle said, making the issues at hand another creative obstacle. Alex O&#8217;Flinn, a lecturer teaching an editing class this quarter, said these limitations inspire him to embrace and take full advantage of this new online platform for instruction. While there are challenges in translating a course to an online format in terms of the short amount of time provided to restructure lesson plans, he said this transition cannot be done successfully without accepting the differences between in-person and online teaching and encouraging discussion among the students.   &#8220;We have to embrace Zoom as its own unique medium,&#8221; O&#8217;Flinn said, &#8220;There's some things in the classroom that can be replicated on Zoom, but there's other things in the classroom that cannot be replicated. If you try to force those things, it's not going to work&#8221;    Stressing the importance of having an adaptive and positive mentality, O&#8217;Flinn sees online instruction as a time of exciting experimentation for both students and teachers to navigate. In addition, O&#8217;Flinn said students are now are able to screen-share documents and photographs in real-time with their peers that would have otherwise been unavailable in a classroom setting.   The new possibility of having Zoom Q&amp;A sessions with   industry professionals   abroad is also exciting, O'Flinn said. And while   the next few months are ambiguous and unprecedented, Rocha said he is excited for the massive wave of opportunities, including new TV shows and films &#8211; professional or student-made &#8211; that will eventually resume production, as well.  &#8220;Instead of thinking of this as a time in which we can't do anything or a time where it's stagnant, we need to keep the mindset that when things get back to normal, there's going to be a lot of good things happening,&#8221; Rocha said.

If some of those goals sound vague, its because they are. Promoting an unspecified advocacy group and providing training to student organizations didnt do her any favors in terms of completing her platforms. Thats not to say they didnt happen at all  the Student Advocacy Partnership Committee exists according to Bonifacio, but is nowhere to be found online and has trained only 22 out of the 225 student organizations it intended to serve.  To be fair, theres a striking correlation between the clarity and completion of Bonifacios platforms. She achieved the straightforward goal of updating the USAC website. She ensured the Campus Safety Alliance was meeting with administrators four times per quarter, as opposed to the one time per quarter required by USAC bylaws. And although Campus Safety Awareness Week could not happen during Week 3 of spring quarter, she has at least donated the extra cash to the USAC COVID-19 Relief Fund.  At base, her work as a liaison between USAC and student organizations was fairly successful.  Her work on council was a different story.  This board had concerns about Bonifacios ability to navigate and enforce bylaws from the day we endorsed her. Unfortunately, she proved us right.  To be fair, shes self aware. She said herself that she could have done better at looking over the bylaws and enforcing them on council.  And while the statement is true, it doesnt make her neglecting her bylaw duties any better.  Outside of bylaws and advocacy, Bonifacio did well in terms of keeping students in the loop with consistent officer reports and meeting notes from her conversations with Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck.  More importantly, shes honest about her shortcomings, and she hopes her predecessor leaves the officer better than they found it.

The Irish musician released his sophomore album Friday, and throughout the 14 tracks, Horan demonstrates a level of depth and artistic growth even as he operates within the usual tropes of love and loss. ""Heartbreak Weather"" tactfully steers clear of overused, cliche pop synths as each song is layered with intricate instrumentals and moving melodies. Horan is able to traverse the stormy seas of a relationship with a mature and seductive voice, resulting in a dynamic pop album.  The album opens on its titular track with an electric guitar and the beginning of a love story. Horan initially pairs his fiery   voice with playful guitar riffs but quickly introduces a groovy bass that underlies the track. In finding the perfect balance between the two elements, ""Heartbreak Weather"" lays the groundwork for Horan to explore a blend of thundering rhythms and heartbreaking lyrics throughout the album.  Following an opening track that begs for a dance floor, Horan wastes no time jumping headfirst into a fast-paced relationship. Black and White sees the singers deeply emotional voice set against the rapid strum of an acoustic guitar, letting music reflect the whirlwind of desire.   It's no chore to fall in love with Horan as he promises, ""There'll never be another.""   [Related:    Album review: Harry Styles Fine Line conveys raw, intense emotions using experimental sounds   ]   This rapid pace sets the tone for two of the album's most energizing songs, Small Talk and Nice To Meet Ya. It quickly becomes clear that the latter  released as a single in October    provides only a glimpse of Horans more mature voice and evolving musical style. Small Talk, with its heart-pounding drums and emotionally provoking riffs, solidifies Horans departure from his typical acoustic ballads.  But while the album's first half demonstrates impressive vocal and artistic range, its the remainder of the record that gives way to a sonically cohesive story. Horan dives into the eye of the storm with Arms Of A Stranger as he details the rocky shores of a failing relationship in which his lover has left (him) with nothing. The narrative is underlaid with the rhythmic bounce of snare drums, making for a sensorially compelling track even as Horan finds himself ""on (his) knees in the darkness.""  The gentle fingerpicking of an acoustic guitar leads Horan out of the dark in ""Everywhere,"" as the musician launches into the album's most soulful songs. With voltaic rhythms layered with drumbeats and quick claps, Horan manages to capture both the devastation that follows an emotional storm and the hope that something new will rise from the ashes  and he does so with the deft hand of seduction in the remaining songs. The passion is tantalizing in New Angel in which Horan croons of ""a touch of someone else to save me from myself."" Backed mostly with electric guitar, the song grows increasingly intimate and inviting even as it plays with explosive rock influences.  Horan doesnt completely abandon his acoustic roots, though. He briefly returns to them as he closes out his album with the soft strums of San Francisco and the drawn-out notes of Still. Horan weathers the storm in these tracks, and they are two of the most lyrically powerful songs of the entire album. While lacking the thrill of stirring riffs and pounding drums, Horan's smooth vocals touch on the cyclical nature of relationships. He arrives back at the place where he began, ending 14 tracks still in love with the same woman he began the album lamenting.   [Related:    Album review: Green Day leaves boulevard of broken dreams in wake of underwhelming 13th album   ]   The somber, tenderly crafted ballad closes out Heartbreak Weather, successfully proving Horan's presence as a dynamic artist. At only his second album since becoming a solo artist, Horan dances between bouncy pop tracks, teases the edges of hard rock and demonstrates his continued mastery of the acoustic love song. In blending all these elements, a majority of Horan's 14 tracks distinguish themselves from the countless other stereotypical love songs on the radio.    Of course, the album also provides the artist room to grow. In drifting between talk of weddings and the beginning stages of burgeoning love, the Irish singer-songwriter might have perfected the balance between moving lyrics and technical rhythms, but the narrative cohesion of ""Heartbreak Weather"" leaves something to be desired.  Either way, Horan navigates the stormy seas of relationships with skill and an emotional depth seen through his vocal range.",['cap-paige-hua'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/heartbreak-weather.jpg

Schools across the globe have shut their doors, fragmenting communities into singular pieces here, there and everywhere. Columnist Kennedy Hill tracks student artists across the globe, recounting the ways each person maintains artistic inspiration while adhering to the new normal.    Westwood has transformed during shelter-in-place orders, changing student art along with it.   The beloved college town is now unrecognizable as students across Westwood are urged to stay home. Stan's Donuts is permanently closed, and Fat Sal's Deli seats remain empty on a Thursday night. Talia Markowitz, a second-year art and Russian studies student, said the cozy, string-lighted college town no longer feels like itself. As one of the many students who stayed near campus despite UCLA's adoption of Zoom classes, Markowitz said her transition from an outdoor LA life to apartment living has shaped her conception of art and execution into more experimental, internet-friendly forms.   [Related:    Scattered Bruins: International students from China explore new art forms while in isolation   ]   ""I've done a lot more stuff, like working with green screens, and adapted for the online sphere,"" Markowitz said.   Originally from New York, Markowitz decided to remain in Westwood to avoid the coronavirus outbreak in her home state. Luckily, most of her friends also stayed in town, allow  ing her to maintain a sense of community, she said. Shelter-in-place order has its downsides, such as removing the in-person experience necessary to critique and appreciate her peers' artwork, she said. But it has also afforded Markowitz time to explore art forms outside of her studio courses.  [caption caption=""Markowitz said shelter-in-place orders have removed many opportunities for critique while also providing time to explore art forms outside of her studio courses. (Niveda Tennety/Assistant Photo editor)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_379802"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   Experimenting with green screens, Markowitz shot a video in which she reenacts the visual composition and hand-based choreography from the ""Wuthering Heights"" music video as an ode to English singer-songwriter Kate Bush. Donning a red dress reminiscent of Bush's original costume, Markowitz lip syncs while executing hand-centric, lyrical choreography in front of a botanical background. Typically, Markowitz wouldn't have time to dabble in a project so outside her normal practice, but said she found her foray into video worthwhile because the skills she advanced through the project.   [Related:    UCLA musicians maximize newfound time by pursuing new projects, art forms   ]    Quarantine has influenced Markowitz's conception of art and society at large, while also impacting her physical art pieces, she said. Because of a long-term health condition, Markowitz spent most of her high school days isolated in her bedroom. Now she finds herself in a similar position, but this time for the safety of others instead of herself.   This introspection manifests itself through Markowitz's exploration of more evocative, abnormal art, she said.  ""I've been sorting these emotions out, coming to terms with this space and what it means for me as a woman and an ill person,"" Markowitz said.  When Markowitz puts down the camera, she fills her time with walks through Westwood &#8211; often with her friend or cat tagging along. Casey Monahan, a fourth-year neuroscience student, said she frequently strolls through campus as a break from her apartment. But Westwood life poses its own issues. Fear caused by the pandemic seems to be subsiding in Westwood, as Monahan said   she   often sees students walk through town or gather for picnics on Janss Steps, mask-free.   Like Markowitz, Monahan has taken advantage of shelter-in-place orders to connect with art, finding solace in creative writing.   Isabella Bustanoby, a second-year physics and art student, said she has noticed a shift in Westwood's energy and its consequential effects on her own state of mind. The piercing bleat of ambulance sirens has replaced the rambunctious boom of frat parties, and Bustanoby said the village's warm ease has curdled into a tentative, looming fear. Like Markowitz, Bustanoby has taken time to reconnect with art by dedicating more of her day to practicing violin and drawing.  ""Art has sort of blended into all aspects of my life,"" Bustanoby said. ""The place where I eat, sleep, have class (and) study is all the same.""  Bustanoby said she is practicing more self-reflection while sheltering in place, allowing her to recontextualize certain art forms through normal, household experiences. Watching shadows and light pass through her bedroom has become a meditative performance, and a pot of green beans has become an audience for vocal exercises, she said.   While shelter-in-place orders have isolated student artists like Bustanoby and Markowitz from their traditional sources of inspiration, Bustanoby said it has allowed her to expand her definition of art from the practical forms to those created outside the norm of daily life.  ""It may sound strange, but there is a new novelty to observation right now, and observation is 90% of making all art,"" Bustanoby said.

The Chicago Sky selected Dean with the 30th overall pick in the third round of Fridays 2020 WNBA draft, which was held remotely due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Dean, the seventh point guard selected in this years draft, will join a Chicago squad that had three All-Stars at the guard position last season  Diamond DeShields, Allie Quigley and Courtney Vandersloot  and finished third in the Eastern Conference.  Chicago also selected power forwards Ruthy Hebard from Oregon and Kiah Gillespie from Florida State in this years draft, adding to a team entering its second season under coach James Wades leadership.  Due to the precautions surrounding the COVID-19 crisis, the start to Deans first professional season has been postponed, with preseason training camps moved to a date to be determined later.  In three seasons as a Bruin, Dean averaged 12.1 points and 4.4 assists per game, including 13.7 points per game in her final season  good for second on the team in scoring.  As a redshirt senior, she also dished out 5.5 assists per game, the second-most in the Pac-12 behind the draft's No. 1 overall pick Sabrina Ionescu from Oregon, and Dean led UCLA in minutes with 33.8 per contest.  Dean recorded her first career triple-double this past season in a Nov. 26 victory against Yale as part of the Bruins program-best 16-0 start to the campaign. She helped UCLA finish 26-5, the best record in her tenure at Westwood.  The guard from Austin, Texas, shot just 30.3% from the field and 25% from 3-point range in Pac-12 competition, as the Bruins went 14-4 in conference play before their elimination at the hands of Stanford in the semifinals of the Pac-12 tournament.

I thought a few weeks would be nothing, and even if it lasted longer, I would always have FaceTime.  Flash forward nearly seven weeks and I realize just how wrong I was. My primary social interaction has switched from nightly dinners at Bruin Plate to weekly Zoom calls with my friends. I go from hours of watching lectures on my laptop to hours of talking to a screen. I try to rekindle the feeling of being in a cramped classic triple through a series of online meetings &#8211; and it&#8217;s mentally exhausting.  Virtual interactions are taxing. It&#8217;s not easy for the most social parts of your day to be spent in bed or at your desk. Video calls require heightened focus and cause hyperawareness of yourself, according to learning and development in the workplace expert Gianpiero Petriglieri in a BBC interview. Picking up on body cues online is much harder than in-person body language, and we aren&#8217;t really aware of how important these subtle, nonverbal cues are to our communication, according to a study published in the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies.  Silence is louder on camera &#8211; and we are more aware and more uncomfortable when there are even a few seconds of it.  I&#8217;ve sat in breakout rooms where no one has said a word for the full 10 minutes, as I grapple with complex material alone. Compared to the collaboration I would experience in a traditional discussion section, it&#8217;s not easy to accept this new reality.  Even on social calls, when the conversation has exhausted the same topics of boredom, schoolwork and California Gov. Gavin Newsom&#8217;s updates, it seems as though every moment that passes in the silence exaggerates the distance between me and my friends. There&#8217;s a certain comfort in quietness when I am physically with my friends &#8211; a comfort that cannot be achieved over the cold stillness of FaceTime.  Quarantine has taught me not to underestimate the importance of being present and appreciative of physical interaction. How can you gauge someone&#8217;s emotion without picking up on their eyes darting around a room, without noticing the way they have been fidgeting during a conversation? It&#8217;s only while I&#8217;ve been home, doing my best to connect with friends in a virtual setting, that I am able to appreciate the power of a hug after a long day or a soft punch on the arm after a stupid joke.  As college students, we are naturally exposed to social interaction at nearly all hours of the day. The complete transition that quarantine has brought is unnatural for those of us accustomed to sharing every moment with others. So much of the beauty of socializing is lost when we can&#8217;t share a look with our best friend during a lecture, or when being together without a constant flow of conversation becomes abnormal.  Add to this the additional stress that comes from being trapped at home and the feeling of obligation that comes with online meetings, and it&#8217;s clear why we&#8217;ve been feeling completely disconnected.  Feeling like you&#8217;re in the spotlight all the time in your own space is tiring and claustrophobic.  Picking up every call and tuning into every conversation from the same desk takes away the freedom and pleasure of friendship.  So, don&#8217;t feel pressured to answer every FaceTime or hop on every social Zoom call. Take a moment to think about if you feel mentally ready to be engaged and active during this particular call and if you feel that it will benefit your mental state. Your mind needs a chance to rest and catch up with the quickly changing world around it.  At the end of the day, no technology can replace physical interaction, as much as we may try. The strain of virtual socialization grows as the weeks of quarantine continue.  A Zoom call might be all we have right now, but it&#8217;s not a call you always have to take.

The first: how lucky I was to follow in the footsteps of some of my mentors in helping our section grow throughout the next year.   The second: How will I run my section when there aren't any sports going on?  When the NCAA canceled the remaining winter and spring sports March 12, players, coaches and fans were disappointed, but everyone who was following these teams knew that the season was done and over. I thought another season would start in the near future and hopefully everything would be back to normal when we reached it.   Whenever that may be.  The first barrier to normalcy is the country's fight against the virus that interrupted the sports world in the first place. Although decision-makers have taken their thoughts away from the coronavirus' impact on sports for now, the conferences, universities and   state and local governments will soon have to decide whether it's worth the risk to allow all sports to proceed come the scheduled start to the seasons.  The first place to look for possible outcomes would be professional leagues. In the United States, the NBA and NHL are both aiming to restart their seasons at or near the playoffs in July in limited cities. MLB has yet to start its season as the players and owners fight over prorated salaries and other resulting crises brought on by the postponement of the 2020-2021 campaign.   On the other hand, the NFL currently plans for business to go on as usual, with no announcements of any delays to the regularly scheduled September   starting date of the 2020 regular season, but with the likelihood that there will be fan restrictions when games do begin. The league does have plans in place should a second wave hit in the fall and games must be delayed.  While the NCAA could mimic any of the nation's professional leagues, the most likely outcome will be the one we've seen from overseas. Unfortunately, that possibly means something no one wants to think about &#8211; no fans.  The Korea Baseball Organization &#8211; South Korea's professional baseball league &#8211; started up with no fans in the audience, limited media presence and constant COVID-19 testing for players.   Any nonplayers or noncoaches at games will also be required to  wear face masks at all times .   The Pac-12 has announced that college athletes could return to schools beginning this month. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that professional sports could come back in June, possibly leading to colleges opening up next. However, most universities, UCLA included, have been silent on exactly when athletes will be able to use campus facilities and train in team settings.  Even with players and coaches all returning, the reality of the situation is fans will probably not be allowed in large numbers for college footbal      l at stadiums. The resulting financial downturn could impact other sports' abilities to stay afloat.  While there has not been any discussion on cutting any Division I sports at UCLA, the same cannot be said for other universities, as schools like Cincinnati, Furman and Wright State have eliminated one or more athletic programs each.  At the moment, signs from conference commissioners point to limited fans, media and personnel allowed in during gameday for football. For other sports, nothing may be known for certain until campuses are fully opened back up to students, although I would not be surprised if schools start to announce preliminary plans soon.  However, while all this has been in view for months now, the nation is dealing with bigger issues than sports at the moment. Protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers have gone on for weeks now and show little sign of slowing down.   Even when they're back in Westwood, athletes' reactions to racial injustice and the ongoing protests and movements could be something to watch out for when games start up. Many UCLA stars and coaches &#8211; including football quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson, gymnast Margzetta Frazier and women's soccer coach Amanda Cromwell &#8211; have been outspoken on social media about speaking out against complacent systems and programs.

But with COVID-19 changing almost all aspects of our lives, how do you know where to go for these needs?  UCLA students benefit from services like the Arthur Ashe Student Health &amp; Wellness Center, UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services, and the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for their health care needs, but with remote learning, students may be wondering how to access these services at home. Luckily, these centers have adapted to pandemic conditions and the Quad is here with a guide to what's available.    To start, the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center has undergone significant changes due to COVID-19: primarily, the move to dedicating resources to treating and testing coronavirus.  The hospital is conducting in-house tests, with hospital staff currently having the capacity to run 500 tests per day. In order to get tested as a UCLA health patient, patients must have an order from a primary care physician and a scheduled appointment.  Besides testing and treatment, the medical center is largely converting visits to telehealth, citing that it minimizes chances for exposure and transmission. In the first week of April, Reagan had around 13,000 telehealth visits, a considerable uptick from their usual 100 per week before the pandemic. These video visits are covered by most health insurance plans, as well as Medicare.  In-person visits are still allowed, but only in certain cases. However, Phil Hampton, a UCLA Health representative, said in an email statement that surgery appointments may start up again.  UCLA Health is carefully planning the return of essential surgeries and procedures  focusing on those postponed over the past seven weeks because of the pandemic and those that have become time-sensitive for the patients condition, Hampton said.  To ensure safety within the hospital, any staff and visitors are screened for symptoms before entering the facilities. All patients admitted to the hospital are tested, and most outpatients  those who receive treatment without being admitted  are tested as well before entering.   [Related:    Even with COVID-19, it is crucial nursing students get enough hands-on training ]   &nbsp;  Though the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center serves as a key medical hub in the UCLA community, many students counted on Ashe for their primary care while at school. Now, Ashe continues to address the needs of the students, whether on campus or not.  Ashe services are still largely available through its  telehealth system , which has just recently included weekend visits as well. However, dentistry and optometry will not have a remote component. Besides telemedicine visits through Zoom, Ashe has also set up a mail-order pharmacy that can ship most medications to students, but only to those living in California.  John Bollard, the interim Ashe Co-Executive Director, said in an email statement that the current version of Ashe services will stick around for the time being.  We anticipate that most visits will happen this way at least through summer, though in-person visits are available, as appropriate, Bollard said.  As Bollard mentioned, Ashe is still maintaining its essential services. On-site visits for appropriate situations, such as physical therapy, specialty womens health and primary care visits, will still be allowed. In addition, COVID-19 testing for those presenting symptoms will also be available at Ashe, as well as antibody testing.  While Ashe has adjusted to both remote and on-site care, CAPS has made a complete move towards telehealth.  Therapy and psychiatric care through CAPS is now conducted fully through Zoom or phone call. Staff members work from home in confidential spaces to ensure privacy with patients.  However, when it comes to students taking advantage of their services during these hard times,    there hasnt been high demand, Executive Director of CAPS Nicole Green said in an email statement.  CAPS is seeing about a 65% drop off in new students seeking services, Green said. CAPS is seeing that students who were already in care prior to COVID remain in treatment and our follow-up care appointments remain relatively stable in therapy and psychiatry.   [Related:    Student organizations collaborate to create 3D-printed PPE for hospitals ]   &nbsp;  For Bruins who are feeling stressed or overwhelmed during their quarter at home, CAPS is  available through the phone . Students in California who want to initiate treatment at CAPS can do so by calling CAPS and participating in a same-day trial appointment. Out-of-state students are offered referrals in their home state through UC SHIP or their private insurance.  For any students already in treatment, regardless of location, CAPS is providing follow-up care for as long as is appropriate. This commitment comes with CAPS decision to cancel session limits for the rest of the school year until the end of this summer.  CAPS has also restarted group therapy sessions through Zoom and RISE wellness programs like peer coaching, stress management, yoga and meditation. And according to Green, CAPS is focusing on providing care for undocumented students, LGBT students and students in certain schools like Anderson and Samueli Engineering.  As UCLA Health continues to transition into telehealth to accommodate students across the world, keep these adapted services in mind in case you find yourself in need of treatment during these difficult times. It may feel strange to see your doctor over Zoom, but hopefully, those yearly check-ups at the office will be in-person again soon.",['cap-cecile-wu'],"['campus-quad', 'student-life', 'quad', 'westwood-quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/5.5.quad_.UCLAhealthcaresystems-01-746x1024.png

True, as a Type 1 diabetic, I am dependent on insulin to live, which means I have to put countless contraptions on my body and prick my fingers daily. The idea of this dependency always makes me feel so fragile &#8211; it reminds me that my whole existence hinges on minuscule amounts of clear liquid in my daily injections.  But being diabetic during a pandemic is a whole new level of fragility.  As a Type 1 diabetic, I do not have a higher chance of contracting COVID-19. However, if I do catch it, my chances of hospitalization, complication and death are significantly higher than a person without Type 1 diabetes. Clearly the pandemic places myself, along with immunocompromised people around the globe, in a precarious position.  Which is why it frustrates me to see so many people forgoing the necessary precautions for slowing the spread of the virus.  Over the past few months, I have observed many friends and acquaintances carelessly   breaking social distancing guidelines   to hang out in groups and even throw parties. The reopening of beaches and restaurants expedited, if not encouraged, this process. And now that states are beginning to ease safety restrictions despite the growing number of coronavirus cases, it is clear the safety of immunocompromised groups is not a priority.   Arguably, this   easing of restrictions   has only undermined efforts to contain the virus, and, in the process, placed the health of millions at risk.    I understand the vast majority of people who don't follow social distancing guidelines   have no malice in their intentions. But what many of them fail to understand is by disobeying public health measures, they are not only putting their own health on the line, but also that of the public &#8211; and especially that of the immunocompromised.  By carrying on with life as normal, even those who are not at risk for the virus could easily become carriers and expose everyone they come in contact with. In other words, they could carry COVID-19 to places where those in     at-risk demographics, like myself, may be exposed to it. As the virus spreads, the more overwhelmed our health care systems will become and the more threatening the virus will be to healthy and immunocompromised people alike.  As someone who is immunocompromised, even the most &#8220;essential&#8221; activities are off limits to me. I am speaking from a place of immense privilege &#8211; I do not have to go to the grocery store or work an essential job because of the support I receive from my family. But at the same time, even the few activities people can justify leaving the house for nowadays are incredibly sparse for the immunocompromised, which only   maximizes symptoms of cabin fever.  The recent Black Lives Matter protests have also added a complicated element to quarantine. Large gatherings of people, like the protests, foster obvious risks of spreading the virus. But with a movement that is a matter of life or death for Black people in America, protests are as essential of an activity as any. Beyond any fear I have over protests spreading the virus, sitting out of even small protests within my town adds a sense of political powerlessness along with cabin fever.     By staying inside every day, routinely giving myself injections and changing my blood glucose monitor site, I have started to feel the same sense of unfairness that I have long since managed to suppress since coming to terms with my chronic illness.  When I was younger, I constantly asked myself why I had to do all of these painful chores just to keep my body functioning.   I remember thinking around the age of 11 or 12 that it was unfair I had to do so much to maintain my health when none of my friends had to deal with anything remotely   similar.  The pandemic is reviving those all too familiar feelings of unfairness within me &#8211; but instead, I now wonder why I have to stay inside, all the while taking my injections and wearing my blood glucose monitor, when my friends have the choice and privilege to break quarantine on a whim     without any serious consequences.  Am I angry at those who are defying safety guidelines, or am I just jealous? And can I really blame those who simply want to see their friends or sit in a restaurant? I would love to invite friends over or walk around a shopping mall right now, and I never thought I would get mad at others for doing just that.  Regardless, as much as I fantasize about leaving the house right now and going back to life as we once knew it, the mere   thought of being in   a public space scares me. The closest I have gotten to people other than my immediate family since coming home from UCLA is seeing individual friends in outside spaces over 6 feet apart.   But even those interactions made me anxious.     Maybe it is my own paranoia or maybe it is valid fear, but as the pandemic persists I am unsure when I will feel comfortable somewhere as populated as Los Angeles again. Will I be able to return to a dorm on the Hill anytime next year? Will I feel safe in a crowded lecture hall?  I never thought I would say this, but I cannot wait to be bombarded with flyers on Bruin Walk again, whenever that time may come.

Instead, he spent much of the term working to fix the Undergraduate Students Association Council from the inside. Many factors went into the boards decision to choose transparency as his highest score, but his effort to make the board Brown Act-compliant and modifications to the USAC Election Code stood out.  [caption id=""attachment_379489"" align=""alignright"" width=""300""]  Council members were evaluated in these areas on a scale from one to five, with one being poor performance and five being excellent performance.[/caption]  Its not typically the job of a general representative to tackle such important undertakings, but his work hasnt gone unnoticed. He said hes suggested about 20 bylaws to increase the publics ability to attend USAC meetings, and, while they have yet to be voted on, he hopes they make meetings more accessible.  Broukhims modifications to the election code should also facilitate the process of running for council, especially for those without prior USAC experience, he said.  And he accomplished all of this in about a little over a quarter.  His arrival to council came during the fall special election, and the process slowed even more when the fairness of fellow councilmember Orion Smedleys campaign came into question.  But despite his extensive work on increasing student accessibility, Broukhim stumbled in the area of engagement and struggled to complete all of his goals in such a short period of time.  His internal focus made representing the general student body somewhat more difficult, though he still managed to keep in touch with matters important to them. For example, he argued to make Pass/No Pass classes a more widely available option, but not to make it mandatory, for spring quarter.  The shift to virtual classes also limited what he could do in his already short time in office. One of his platforms, for example, included creating a centralized database that facilitates the search for on-campus tutoring services. But he found it difficult to implement the idea within the span of only a quarter.  Broukhim fulfilled his overall responsibilities as a general representative in a satisfactory manner. As an active member of the council, he contributed to discussions and aimed to keep in mind the effects any decision could have on marginalized communities.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.op_.usac_.2Broukhim.jpg

And while the constant headlines and daily press coverage of the scandal have since winded down, the effects of the scandal are still fresh on the campus of UCLA.   On March 12,  news broke  that coaches across the nation had accepted bribes to admit prospective students as student-athletes, a tool to increase their chances of admission to highly competitive schools. Over the course of the investigation, authorities determined that coaches from seven schools &#8211; many of which boast prestigious athletic programs &#8211; played a role in these admissions practices.  UCLA was no exception to the investigation, as former men's soccer coach Jorge Salcedo was named as one of the individuals who accepted bribes from Rick Singer.   Nearly a year since the scandal broke out, UCLA &#8211; both in the athletics and admissions departments &#8211; has worked to move past it, but the lingering effects have continued to affect both.  UCLA admissions promised to conduct more comprehensive checks on donations made from parents of possible applicants, while the athletic department agreed to add additional verification and compliance checks to all its incoming athletes.  But with even more outstanding allegations flooding in, all of this feels like a public relations move.   UCLA Athletics, on the other hand, pointed the finger at Salcedo and distanced itself from him after the charges were made public. Since then, the Los Angeles Times  reported  that the department knew of a possible admissions scheme in sports since 2014, and UCLA will now have to fend off allegations of an admissions culture that has been built on monetary greed.   In a motion  filed Jan. 16, Salcedo alleged UCLA purposefully has admitted athletes that may not meet normal admissions or athletic standards for multiple teams &#8211; not just his. In his subpoena request, Salcedo suggests the university used this as a method to raise money through rich admits and recruit high-performing students to raise team GPAs.  The first part of his accusation tries to shift the blame for Varsity Blues from coaches to the athletic department. If the school knew parents would donate millions if their child were allowed to be on a Division-I program, then the argument could be made that universities are behaving in the same way as the accused coaches &#8211; allowing kids onto teams despite not possessing Division-I skillsets, all for the sake of money.    Universities thrive off donations from wealthy parents and alumni, and the quid pro quo of donating large sums of money in exchange for their child's admission has long been an unspoken reality in the admission processes of top colleges. While this is technically not illegal, it falls under the same blanket as what the coaches did, albeit with a different benefactor.   If UCLA wants to make a real change, student-athletes coming from big donors need to be screened extra carefully, including determining whether photos are doctored. While this may seem unfair to prospective students with alumni parents, it would at least be a step in the right direction toward preventing something like this from being repeated in the future.  Salcedo and UCLA are both in the wrong here. Salcedo allowed himself to be drawn in by the prospect of more money and allowed students who did not play the sport competitively to join his team, knowing they didn&#8217;t deserve it.  UCLA may have wanted to keep this all under wraps, all while boasting a system that also allegedly admitted underqualified students.   To see both sides fighting with each other instead of owning up to their mistakes and changing for the better is a poor reflection on the university and athletic department. It feels like a slap in the face to every student and prospective student committed to doing the admissions process the honest way.

Of course, its the quintessential breakfast item these days  customizable, build-your-own bagel sandwiches like the ones at The Study make for a quick and easy on-the-go morning meal for when youre running late for the 9 a.m. discussion in Bunche Hall that youve been dreading all week.  But before the everything bagel, decked out with avocado cream cheese spread and Kalamata olives  so LA, by the way  was even on peoples minds, the bagel was a sort of everymans food, a staple of Polish-Jewish culture and cuisine.   A distant relative of the pretzel,  bagels are bread with a particularly distinctive cooking process in which the dough is boiled prior to baking, giving the circular loop of dough a characteristically chewy interior. Here, The Quad explores the bagels rich history, giving context for how the bread product has transformed over the years and made its way into American cuisine as a staple breakfast food.  While we think of pretzels and bagels as inherently different food items these days  one a stiff and somewhat bland snack item coated in salt, the other a satisfying and chewy carb-based vessel for toppings like cream cheese or hummus  the two were actually not all that distinct from each other back during the Middle Ages in Europe.  Bagel historian and author Maria Balinska surmises a number of different bagel origin stories in her book The Bagel: The Surprising History of a Modest Bread, the most interesting of which being that they were first introduced to Poland during a period of increased German immigration to the region. Pretzels have an even longer history than bagels, having been produced in Catholic monasteries since the seventh century   the characteristic, twisted shape  of the pretzel is actually meant to resemble a child with his arms crossed in prayer, but thats a story for a different article.  When the pretzel made its way to Poland, Balinska argues that it quickly evolved into the round, donut-shaped roll that we know it as today  in Polish, this proto-bagel is known as obwarzanek, and can still be found on the streets of Polish cities today. At first glance, obwarzanek might be indistinguishable from the American bagel, but there are a couple of major differences.  Obwarzanek are larger and wider, with the hole in the center serving almost as a handle; additionally, you wont find an everything obwarzanek or one with chocolate chips twisted into the dough  these pastries are typically topped off with a sprinkling of poppy seeds only. According to  The Atlantic , written records of the obwarzanek go back all the way to the 14th century. Its similar to other bagel cousins that developed in Eastern Europe, like the Russian and Ukrainian bublik, another hand-held, circular bread roll thats boiled before baking.  The bagel, on the other hand, did not enter the written record until 1610, according to Balinska. The bagel appeared in a number of Jewish sumptuary laws, written by rabbis to mandate just what kinds of foods and other private expenditures could be enjoyed by specific households and individuals. In the case of the bagel, it was primarily meant as an indulgent treat to enjoy at the circumcision celebrations for a baby boy, according to Balinska; other scholars like Leo Rosten note that the sumptuary laws allow for bagels to serve as a gift for women in childbirth.  Among a number of other anti-Semitic restrictions that European Christians had put on European Jewish life in the Middle Ages, Jews in Poland were banned from baking bread. Balinska notes that laws enacted from 800 C.E. to 900 C.E. explicitly banned Jewish individuals from baking bread in an oven, while later mandates declared that only members of the Krakow bakers' guild, who were typically gentile, could produce white bread.  In part, the bagel became largely associated with Jewish culture because boiling bread before toasting it served as a loophole to get around the laws that banned Jews in Poland from baking bread. The bagel was thus born out of necessity  it was Jewish cuisines take on the obwarzanek, but it was also one of the only ways Jewish people could legally produce their own breads.    The bagel remained a stronghold of Polish-Jewish cuisine throughout the following centuries. During the 19th century, Jewish immigration to the United States increased significantly as a result  of political upheaval in Europe . A large number of these immigrants settled in New York City  perhaps the American city most closely associated with bagels  bringing their cuisine along with them.  Bagel production became such a major market among local Jewish communities that bagel bakers formed a union in New York City called the Bagel Bakers Local 338. However, bagel consumption was largely limited to Jewish communities until the 1970s,  according to Smithsonian Magazine .  If you've ever eaten a store-bought bagel or warmed up a frozen one, chances are you might have eaten one from  Lender's Bagels . The Lender family began producing bagels in local markets during the 1920s, but with the advent of television advertising, their line of frozen bagels became a hit across the country in the '70s, when they marketed them as the ""Jewish English muffin."" It also probably helped that their commercials had  an enticingly kitschy aesthetic , adopting the cheesy slogan ""First You Crave... Then You Rave.""  The rest is history  as a result of Lender's popularity, bagels entered the mainstream and never looked back. In Los Angeles, bagel shops can be found all across the city, from The Bagel Broker in the Fairfax District to Belle's Bagels by Highland Park. Oh, and put The Study at Hedrick on that list.",['cap-andrew-warner'],"['lifestyle-quad', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/emily-dembinksi.png

Participation in the 2020 census is 11% lower than in the 2010 census as of April 30, according to a  university press release .  Shelter-in-place mandates are contributing to the lagging response rate for the census, said Paul Ong, research professor at the Luskin School of Public Affairs and director of the UCLA Center for Neighborhood Knowledge who led the analysis, in the press release.  The self-response period of the census, when the American public could answer the census via mail and online responses, began March 12, coinciding with the social isolation and distancing restrictions that began in mid-March.  COVID-19 is making it difficult for the U.S. Census Bureau to conduct outreach efforts, such as door-to-door campaigning, in communities that are harder to reach via email or phone, said Chris Tilly, a professor of urban planning at UCLA.  However, Tilly also said he believes the COVID-19 pandemic is not the only culprit behind the lack of response to the census.  The American public may be worried their census responses will be used against them by government agencies, may not understand the benefits of the census or may be overloaded with other economic concerns such as paying for food and rent during the pandemic, Tilly said.  The U.S. Census Bureau designated April 1 as Census Day to advertise the census to collect more responses, but it did not draw a substantial amount of media coverage and was less effective than intended, Ong said.  The U.S. Census Bureau has also allowed people to submit census forms digitally for the first time, to protect the health and safety of its employees and the American public because of COVID-19, according to the  2020 U.S. Census Bureau website .  However, limited internet access may also be contributing to the lack of responses, said Donald Treiman, a distinguished professor emeritus of the sociology department and faculty associate of the California Center for Population Research.  Digitally submitting forms may be more convenient than mail-in ballots, however, there is a significant population that does not have access to, or is not comfortable using the internet to submit responses, Treiman said.  Marcelo Su&#225;rez-Orozco, Wasserman dean and professor at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, said the census is a necessary tool for allocating resources and funding to inhabitants and is important to uphold U.S. democracy.

Or so the saying was supposed to go.  Because the old are sticking around for one more year.  With only one senior on each of its rosters, both UCLA mens and womens tennis were set to lose just one player each to graduation following the 2020 season. But after both seasons were cut short because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NCAA and later UCLA gave spring sport student-athletes the option to return for an additional year of eligibility on March 30 and April 23, respectively.  For both senior Ben Goldberg from the mens side, and redshirt senior Jada Hart on the womens, it meant they each had the chance to wear the four letters on his or her chest for one last go on the court.  And they took it.  There was not much of a decision, Goldberg said. A hundred percent I would come back. There was no call on the phone with (coach) Billy (Martin), there was no long talk with my family. I was holding my breath waiting to see if the NCAA would grant eligibility or not. Playing for UCLA means absolutely everything to me, so (once they did), there was no difficult decision.  Goldberg announced that he would return for his fifth year via a team video posted on Twitter on April 30. The last player to receive a ball passed from frame to frame featuring every member of the team, Goldberg held the ball up to the camera  with the words 1 more year scribbled onto the felt.  A week before the announcement from the mens team, Hart announced she would return for her sixth year in Westwood. As the first spring sport student-athlete from UCLA to announce that she would take the additional year, Hart said she wanted to finish her career as a Bruin on her own terms.  Her team had opened the season with a 12-1 record, defeating then-No. 1 Stanford first at the ITA indoor championship and then again in the first week of conference play. Hart had never defeated Stanford in her time at UCLA prior to 2020 and said the strong start by the Bruins made the news of the cancellation sting all the more.  It was extremely painful, especially knowing that this was the team that could go all the way in the NCAA tournament, Hart said. There were so many great things that we had accomplished this year, and we had put ourselves in a great position to be one of the top contenders.  On what would have been her Senior Day at the Los Angeles Tennis Center against crosstown rival USC, the team scheduled a surprise Zoom call to honor Hart and her achievements over her five-year career.  I didnt know what their plans were until coach Stella (Sampras Webster) spoiled their plans a little bit,"" Hart said. ""I got the inside scoop of what they were going to do, so it was easier for me to give them my announcement.  In the last moments of the call, Hart said she knew she had to tell her team to save their senior speeches, because she would be back at school for another year.  They didnt see it coming, Hart said. They thought I was going to record the call just to have the memories of what they were going to say about me. But thats when I told the girls, and they were very surprised and it turned out to be really nice.    From LA to Germany and back, with some surprises along the way.

Hart  who graduated in March with her degree in political science  will apply to graduate school for the next academic year, having taken her GRE on Sunday. Goldberg was set to graduate after taking a summer course to fulfill his language requirement but will postpone that requisite to the fall and continue his time as an undergraduate for the winter and spring quarters.  In the meantime, both Hart and Goldberg said theyre doing their best to stay busy while quarantined at home  through working out and spending family time that they otherwise wouldnt have when theyre at school.  I try to get out of the house multiple times a day, Goldberg said. (I'm) going on a bunch of runs and walks, and I go to my friends house to work out every day. He plays basketball at Oregon so its motivating to have a system like that, and I feel myself getting stronger every day.""

San Diego-based restaurant chain Souplantation announced earlier this month that they will not be reopening any of   their 97 buffet-style locations after the COVID-19 shutdowns. And, although Southern California residents may raise an eyebrow at out-of-towners referring to their beloved Souplantation as ""Sweet Tomatoes,"" both groups would surely agree that name is unimportant in light of what the restaurant chain faces now.  Thanks to a global pandemic and health concerns, buffet-style restaurants  and even our own self-serve bars at UCLA dining halls  may soon fade into carb-loaded oblivion. To find out why, let's dive into the history of buffet-style dining and the reasons why it no longer seems to fit in today's world.  Though buffets seemed to be, at least at one time, a cornerstone of American culture, it turns out their roots are actually found in 20th-century globalization and commercialization.  At the 1939 World's Fair in New York, the Swedish introduced Americans to the concept of a smrgsbord: a long table that is home to an array of cold cuts, warm appetizers, regional delicacies, side salads and drinks that eventually transition into entres and desserts. This wide assortment of food was evidently extremely appealing to the American observers, and the introduction of the smrgsbord ushered in the beginning of the evolution into the buffets many of us frequent today.  The Swedish gave us the idea of the smrgsbord, but the word ""buffet"" comes from the French. A buffet refers to an elaborate display of food that signified grandeur; the idea was to dine in abundance, like the gods.  Despite its European and New English origins, this culinary design as we know it in the United States today   initially grew out of the American southwest, when Herb McDonald established the first American buffet in the 1940s. Named Buckaroo Buffet, the Las Vegas eatery served all-you-can-eat salads, meats and other cost-effective foods that would entice visitors to spend more time in the casino. The cost to enter? Just a single buckaroo.  It's easy to see why buffets quickly became an American staple within the casino business. They were practical for families, convenient for travelers and profitable for owners who realized they could continuously feed tourists and casino-dwellers to keep them from exiting the establishment.  Not to mention, television commercials advertised lavish spreads of comfort foods and promises of satisfaction, capitalizing on the allure of greed and excess that were characteristic of casinos. The concept of casino buffets became a family favorite and soon led to the evolution of the comfort-style buffet chains people have come to love.  [caption id=""attachment_382920"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Some Sweet Tomatoes recipes are easy to prepare at home for when you're craving the buffet experience. (Kanishka Mehra/Assistant Photo editor)[/caption]  Over the last 80 years, the popularity of buffet chains has fluctuated. For buffet-style restaurants like Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes, threats to the industry have taken several different   forms   over the years.  During the 2008 financial crisis, Souplantation, along with many other buffet chains, filed for bankruptcy due to a lack of customers  despite a regular lunch visit costing just under $10 per person. While American buffet restaurants   came out of the recession with high hopes, they were suddenly met with a more health-conscious public and increasing awareness about the spread of foodborne diseases, such as E. coli and salmonella.  Despite dips in business over the years, buffets have never faced as glaring of a threat to their existence as they d  o today. Renewed financial instability as a result of the pandemic, a more health-conscious public and sanitation   concerns have rendered buffets an unsustainable business model, with physical closures of the restaurants due to COVID-19 as the final blow for some.  Shutdown orders across the nation have caused many restaurants to close temporarily or shift to delivery and take-out only. Buffet-style restaurants, on the other hand, have been forced to shut their doors completely, as their business models aren't conducive to contactless alternatives.  John Haywood, the CEO of Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes, said in an interview with Restaurant Business earlier this month that finances were going well for the chain until federal regulations caused them to close all of their restaurants with no foreseeable date for reopening or feasible way of doing so in the meantime.  The magic of our concept is people being able to customize and control their own experience, Haywood said in the interview. To convert it into basically a table-service restaurant doesnt work.  [caption id=""attachment_382921"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""869""]    My mother and I at a Sweet Tomatoes in Tempe, Arizona, last winter. (Courtesy of Kanishka Mehra)[/caption]  I hear you, Haywood  I hate to see the restaurants go, too.     Growing up, outings to Sweet Tomatoes meant relaxed, quality time with the whole family in a comfortable setting surrounded by food. The 50-foot-long salad bars, trays of comfort foods and well-stocked   dessert stations were more than just visually appealing  they also sparked my inner child. There was something magical about getting to try it all and making my own decisions with instant gratification.  As it turns out, Im not alone in my nostalgia for buffet-style restaurants; several other Bruins are feeling the same sense of loss.  Third-year physiological science student Ishita Monga was saddened by the news that Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes would not be reopening in the future.  When I came home because of the pandemic, I was like I cant wait until this is all over and we can just go to Sweet Tomatoes, and have a nice dinner, Monga said. When I saw the headline, I was staring at it for a while, like You cant be serious.  It's a shame that one of our favorite places to eat will not be there after we emerge from quarantine, but reflecting on memories can provide some comfort. Second-year human biology and society student Miranda Le reminisced on the good times she had with her family at the establishment.  We would go to Sweet Tomatoes and put all of the tables together and have a big feast sitting in a buffet, Le said. A good thing about buffet-style restaurants is that theyre a haven for kids: you can play with your food and make cool concoctions, so it was just a very fond memory of my childhood.  But even more concerning than one buffet-style restaurant chain closing is the potential that all of them may close in the near future.     Equally disheartened by the news, first-year neuroscience student Annika Zhang said she believes buffets will suffer more from the consequences of the pandemic than sit-down restaurants because of buffets' do-it-yourself theme. The pandemic may cause people to be more cautious about doing anything themselves, even after it's over, Zhang said.  Although we cant use Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes   as the light at the end of the quarantine   tunnel anymore, and though the future of buffet-style dining may be in jeopardy, the memories we formed at these restaurants live on in our hearts. To commemorate the end of an era, I prepared some of my favorite buffet foods from Sweet Tomatoes.

No one knows for certain if buffets will ever make a comeback, but Monga said she anticipates they will live on because of their cost-effectiveness.  When you go to a buffet, you pay $15 to $20 and you can eat an unlimited amount of food; the value of that food is probably going to be more than what you paid for, Monga said. Whereas if you go to a sit-down restaurant and get a $15 dish, thats only one plate of food. Its not the same.  The future of buffet-style dining might currently be up in the air, but one thing is for sure: nothing will compare to the feeling of home and comfort I felt at Sweet Tomatoes. There won't be a next ""thyme,"" but the skill of fitting multiple different kinds of pasta on one plate will stay with me forever.",['cap-kanishka-mehra'],['quad'],https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/souplantation-1024x705.png

SC:  My name is Sam Connon. I'm the Sports editor at the Daily Bruin. Welcome back to ""Out of Bounds,"" the Daily Bruin Sports podcast. Today, I'm joined again by co-host Ryan Smith, Daily Bruin senior staffer, former Sports editor. Ryan, how's it going?   Ryan Smith:  You know it's going good.   SC:  Great. And today we are joined by our last guest of the quarter on our last episode of the quarter, assistant Sports editor Jack Perez. Jack, how's it going?   Jack Perez:  Oh, it's going great Sam. I'm so excited to be here.   SC:  I can tell you've been pining to get on the show for a while now.   JP:  Since week one I wanted to be on it and Sam said, ""Last week of the quarter, you can do it."" And now I'm here.   SC:  It has all built up to this. This is really all everyone has been waiting for, some ""Avengers: Endgame""-style climax right here with Jack Perez joining us. Today we're really just going to be talking about men's basketball. I know there's a lot of other stuff going on in UCLA sports. Women's basketball has the the week off before NCAAs and softball, baseball playing well, gymnastics continues to get perfect 10s and win meets, but really, it's just men's basketball-centric on today's episode. Ryan and I were there on Saturday when they lost to USC, so we'll start off with that before we get into Pac-12, NCAA stuff. So Ryan, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from Saturday's game in USC?   RS:  I'd say the biggest takeaway is that really the only thing that wasn't working was the offense. And the thing is, if this team plays like this in the tournament, they're gonna be fine. I don't think if you woke up on Saturday feeling like they were gonna win the tournament, I'm not feeling any less confident thinking they're going to be able to do the same thing. You know, the shooting was rough, the offense was slow, but again, the defense was so good and that's really what this team has been doing well lately. So, you know, just keep that going.   SC:  Yeah, USC, I know they didn't shoot too well from the field for the entire game, but they did hit six of their last seven shots, so that is a little bit concerning to see such a great defensive effort from the Bruins just kind of, like, fade away towards the end. I know that crazy step-back by Jonah Mathews is obviously a dagger, but I mean, six out of seven to end the game is not really what you want to get from your defense. Jack, I don't know, what did you think of the game against USC last week?   JP:  You know, you're only going to shoot 31.4% so many times. These guys' averages will regress to the mean, and that's a good sign for UCLA. The fact that they were never down by more than five throughout the whole game, USC did shoot pretty well in the second half, but in the first half, they were held to a pretty low shooting percentage. It just shows that Mick Cronin's defense is really starting to click right now. Just keeping it in tight games, tight defensive games, is really solid for this team. We don't want to go into a shootout, we know that, and to keep a team like USC to 54 points  while we only scored 52  is still impressive and should still be commended. That being said, we shot really well from the free throw line, they didn't, maybe that balances out during the tournament. So guys like Chris Smith and Jaime will have to step up and score a little bit more. Hopefully Jaime doesn't shoot 1-for-8 every single time out there.   SC:  Yeah, I know Cody Riley is part of the free throw resurgence. But, I mean, just a few weeks ago, he was shooting under 50%, and now he just basically can't miss from the free throw line. Don't want to jinx the guy but still, I mean, he went 5-of-6 against Arizona State, 7-of-8 against Arizona and then 5-of-6 against USC. And that one miss, he got the offensive rebound, UCLA ended up scoring on that possession. So you take a guy who's just a bad free throw shooter  and Cronin keeps talking about how he's a gym rat, how he's in there all the time, always looking to improve  but that's huge when you're in these close games when you're in these tight games, conference tournament, March Madness, free throw shooting is huge. Almost every game in March Madness winds up going to intentional fouls, free throws, someone at the line, having to make a comeback, having to slow someone down, having to hold a lead, and free throws are a huge part of that. So with Chris Smith shooting above 80% from the free throw line, Tyger Campbell's getting better from the free throw line  after he had a bad game from the from line a few days ago, I know. But when your big men are shooting this well from the free throw line, that's when you know you can win these tight games. I know you lose one by two against USC, that's obviously tough, buzzer-beater 3s are definitely, those definitely sting. But it's nice to see that in those final moments, UCLA has that clutch gene, really. I mean, Chris Smith, with a minute left, had that crazy shot, that hop-step in the post, it was to cut it to one, not every guy can do that. So even if UCLA doesn't have a go-to scorer, a guy can hit a step-back 3 at the buzzer like Jonah Mathews, then you still have guys who can create their shots down low in the post, in the paint. So that's definitely something promising to see. Ryan, any other takeaways from the USC games? Negative, positive?   RS:  I just think when when you shoot 31%  that's the team season low  and you're up by one with nine seconds left, I think that just says a lot about where this team is and how it's grown. I think if you told Mike Cronin he was gonna have his worst shooting day of the year and he was gonna have a chance to win it at the very last second, he would take that. And the things that are gonna make this team succeed  succeed in the postseason  are going to be the defense and taking care of the little things. And they don't miss free throws, they play good defense. If they can keep doing that, they'll be fine.   SC:  Yeah, so the loss on Saturday locked in the Bruins for the No. 2 seed in the Pac-12 tournament. It didn't really end up mattering because Oregon won Saturday night anyways, so they were gonna be the No. 2 seed no matter what. But No. 2 seed plays at 6 o'clock, Thursday night in Las Vegas. They will play the winner of Cal and Stanford, who are the No. 7 and No. 10 seeds. So, Jack, I know you and one of our staff writers, Dylan D'Souza, you guys broke down all the teams in the Pac-12 field. What can you tell us about Cal and Stanford specifically, and what matchup do you think would be better for UCLA?   JP:  Well, in terms of what's going to help us get into the NCAA tournament, we definitely want to play Stanford. You know, we haven't beaten them this year at all, they're on the bubble, we're right ahead of them on the bubble. Stanford would definitely be the preferred matchup in terms of seeding. The team we definitely want to play would be Cal. We played Cal once this year at home, held them to 40 points, which was their season low. They really struggle to score a lot more than Stanford does and it just seems like that's the school that you want to be facing in the tournament. It's the team that has struggled out of the gate, they've struggled away from their home, whereas Stanford  especially early on in the season  looked like a top-25 team for sure. They've scuffled down the end a bit, but I think if UCLA was hoping for one of those teams to come through, it would be Cal.   SC:  Yeah, I know UCLA held Cal to 40 points when they played here earlier this year, so that's an offense you would like to play again if you're Mick Cronin and know that you are able to stop them. And it's not like there was a crazy home-court advantage for UCLA that day, they only scored 50 points. But yeah, there really wasn't a huge fan, there wasn't a huge crowd there, so it's not like UCLA had that helping them hold down home court. It was just a tough, grind-it-out win, and I think you'd see a lot of the same should UCLA and Cal play again. Yeah, I mean, Cal, they beat Utah in overtime last week, but they got swept by Oregon, Oregon State. They lost a Washington a few weeks ago, who's last place in the conference, so they're not really anything special. But yeah, like you were saying, Stanford had some flashes earlier in the season so they're definitely a real team, they're not someone you can completely overlook. But yeah, to get into the tournament  the real tournament  that would definitely be a big resume booster, help bury Stanford a little bit and also help yourself in the process. So I don't know Ryan, what do you think that UCLA has to do in the Pac-12 tournament this week to secure an at-large bid for March Madness?   RS:  You know, you and I have talked about this for weeks at this point, but losing that game to USC in the finale really doesn't help their case. At this point, you almost kind of hope that they get Stanford, considering they lost that team by 15 earlier in the year, maybe you blow them out the way you're playing now and that's a big-time resume booster in the case that you get to the final and then lose to a team like Oregon or USC. Because I think they have a good chance of getting through ASU in the second round if that's who they end up playing. But really, I think they're gonna have to win this tournament to feel safe. But yeah, I mean, if they're going to get an at-large bid, you would hope that it would come by beating the highest seeds possible on the way to  then losing in  the final.   SC:  Yeah, I mean, I don't think they have to win the Pac-12 tournament to secure a spot. I don't think they need the automatic qualifier for the Pac-12. I mean, obviously, they'd be a lock at that point because they'd automatically get in. But I think if UCLA beat Stanford  and basically kicks Stanford out of the running  and kind of the cards fall their way in other conference tournaments, I think that'll set them up for a First Four appearance. But then if they win in the semifinals against Arizona State  probably, or it could be Colorado  if they win that semifinals matchup and just make it to the finals, I think they are a lock to get in as a bye, no First Four appearance this time. So I think that would pretty much do it for them because losing to Oregon or USC or Arizona in the Pac-12 finals won't be too awful, honestly, like, I don't think that looks that bad. So I would really just say, ""Make it to the finals, you're good. Make it to the semis, flip a coin, see what happens."" So I don't know, Jack, what's what's your opinion on this team's NCAA chances?   JP:  If we make it to the finals, I believe  especially if we play Oregon and we play them well  I think we're basically a lock to avoid the First Four even and make it into the tourney as probably a No. 11, maybe even stretch in as a No. 10 seed. If we play ASU in the semifinals, we should be able to beat them. It's quite possible though, ASU did beat us earlier in the year, so it could be a toss-up, especially on a neutral court. The worst case scenario  which is if we lose to Stanford in the second round, in the quarterfinals on Thursday  is I believe we might drop out of the tournament entirely. Our NET ranking is in the 70s right now, Stanford is currently in the 30s. They have  yeah, surprisingly  but I think especially with them being a bubble team, and if a couple conference tournaments don't go our way around the country, I could see UCLA falling to the NIT.   SC:  Yeah, at this point, an NIT bid is basically a lock if UCLA doesn't make March Madness. But I mean, there's a lot going right for UCLA at this point. There's still a wide-open door really. I hope they make the final and play Oregon just because I'm dying to see UCLA-Oregon again. Not that UCLA would make it any tighter, but just because I want to see Payton Pritchard again. That dude is amazing. So, Ryan, what's the Pac-12 team, not that you think UCLA could beat, but just the most entertaining team to watch, the team that you would want to watch the most?   RS:  I mean, obviously, Oregon's the most fun, like you said, Payton Pritchard's just everything you want to watch. But I have enjoyed the UCLA-Arizona State matchups this year. That first game was a shootout, I'm a big fan of the shootout-type games. But I mean, the revenge game against USC would obviously be really fun too, any game with Arizona is great. There's a lot of ways this could go where it'd be great for all the fans. So nothing I'm really looking for, but I'm just excited to see how this all unfolds.   SC:  Yeah, I know that if UCLA makes the final plays USC, that would be pretty epic because I mean, you had Chris Smith postgame on Saturday say that he wants to play USC again in the tournament. That's before he knew that USC would be the No. 4 seed and that they'd be on the other side of the bracket, but still, he said he hopes that they play again, he hopes the Trojans come in cocky. So that would be really fun to see them play again. So I don't know, Jack, do you have any final thoughts on the Pac-12 tournament this week?   JP:  I'm really interested in that 4-5-12 quadrant. USC, obviously, has shown out and beat us to get that bye, which they might have fallen to the No. 5 had they not. So now, this forced Arizona to play Washington in the first round, which I think is probably the most exciting matchup of that opening round. I think the team that comes from there  while they do have to go through Oregon to get to the finals  is in a really good spot. Whether it's USC or Arizona, both are probably locks to make tournament right now, but I think both can enhance their seeding a lot by possibly beating Oregon, and then possibly beating UCLA or Arizona State in the final.   SC:  Yeah, I know Oregon is the heavy favorite, and for good reason. They've probably been the best team in the Pac-12 start to finish, day one to now. So we'll see how it ends up going there, who wins the Pac-12 tournament. You should all read the  scouting report  by Jack and Dylan. That will be on dailybruin.com on the sports page, so keep an eye out for that. There will be coverage all weekend long when UCLA does get going, starting Thursday. I will be there in Las Vegas to cover that so, yeah, keep an eye out for all our coverage, follow us on Twitter, thanks again for listening.

After taking some time to collect our thoughts, we've come together to bring you the first episode of a new podcast, featuring stories from all five of our content sections. We'll be here each week, highlighting some of the stories we've written and the things we've seen. Here's episode one of ""The Online Edition,"" which we're calling The Adjustment Show.  [embed url=""https://soundcloud.com/dailybruin/the-online-edition-the-adjustment-show"" contenteditable=""false"" uuid=""66c22c3c1a154bedb7d4035cda66f1b7"" provider=""SoundCloud""]https://soundcloud.com/dailybruin/the-online-edition-the-adjustment-show[/embed]       Omar Said:  Hey, is everybody online?   Molly Wright:  Yup.   Lucy Carroll:  Yup.   Kristin Snyder:  Yeah.   David Gray:  Uh huh.   Sam Connon:  Yup.      OS:  Alright, it looks like were ready to get started.  Just like everyone else, editors at the Daily Bruin are still figuring out how to make things work as we shelter in place, or stay safer at home, as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti prefers to call it. Bruins have now mostly scattered, leaving Westwood for their homes across America and the world. With unprecedented changes to the world, work and education, everyone is now finding new ways to do the things they once did every day.   OS:  Here at the Daily Bruin, wed been planning all sorts of things. Just a few weeks ago, we were planning on sending Sports editor Sam Connon to the Pac-12 men's basketball tournament. Soon after that would come March Madness, and after opening up 2020 as one of the worst teams in the nation, it looked like UCLA might actually qualify this year. UCLA women's basketball was prepping a tournament run of its own, and we were preparing a special insert to preview both teams' prospects on the upcoming national stage. We were planning an insert about campus safety and security for a few weeks later  with arguments about how it should be improved. But those plans  all our plans  were dashed week 10, when UCLA suspended in-person classes on March 10 and migrated to online instruction through the second week of spring quarter. Two days later, the Pac-12 and the NCAA canceled their tournaments, and the day after that, UCLA extended the move to online classes through the end of spring quarter. Suddenly, so suddenly, everything just stopped.   OS:  Since then, we here at the Daily Bruin have been finding ways to keep doing our jobs in the middle of all this change. Bruins have found themselves taking online classes from homes in other states, other countries, and even just their dorms and apartments in Westwood  albeit much more lonely than before. Thats why for the first time, Im Omar Said, the Daily Bruins head of podcasts, recording from under a blanket fort around my desk at home in Rancho Cucamonga, California  about an hour east of UCLA in good traffic.   DG:  Im David Gray, the Daily Bruin News editor, and Im recording from my closet at home in Pasadena, California.   LC:  Im Lucy Carroll, the Daily Bruin Opinion editor, and Im recording from my closet at home in Healdsburg, California.   KS:  Im Kristin Snyder, the Daily Bruin Arts editor, and Im recording from my closet at home in Orange, California.   SC:  Im Sam Connon, the Daily Bruin Sports editor, and Im recording from my grandparents second-floor storage closet in Mattapoisett, Massachusetts.   MW:  Im Molly Wright, the Daily Bruin Blogging editor, and Im recording from my closet at home in Fort Collins, Colorado.   OS:  Now, were all sitting in these weird places because the clothes in our closets and the blankets around my desk are absorbing sound  forming makeshift recording studios so that we can make this show about the one thing all Bruins are doing now: adjusting, and learning how to keep our lives moving, at least in some way, like they used to before.   OS:  From the Daily Bruin, this is ""The Online Edition .""  Im Omar Said, and today, were bringing you our first episode: The Adjustment Show. Stay tuned, were bringing you stories about Westwood, UCLA and Bruins  and the way theyre all adjusting to our newfound situation.  &nbsp;   12 Stories, 5 minutes    Omar Said:  Page 1: 12 Stories, 5 minutes. Weve been under shelter-in-place orders for 17 days now in California, as we record on Sunday. Being trapped inside that long has left many people stir-crazy. Some have put that energy into playing Animal Crossing, which came out March 20  just hours after Californias order to stay at home went into effect the evening of March 19. Others, like the Daily Bruins News editor, have put that energy into less wholesome activities, like messing with their staff. Here with me now is News editor David Gray, who has decided to create a unique challenge for two of his assistant editors: In five minutes or less, theyre going to tell 12 News stories chosen by him about changes made as a result of COVID-19.   David Gray:  Hi, Omar. So, to start things off, Id like to point out that this is not just a challenge - its a competition. Ill be choosing a winner at the end, based on a secret set of factors only I can ever know. With that being said, Id like to introduce assistant news editors Kate Nucci and Marilyn Chavez-Martinez.   Kate Nucci:  Hello.   Marilyn Chavez-Martinez:  Hey!   DG:  Alright, so we flipped a coin before we came on the air, and Kate gets to go first. Omar, can you put 5 minutes on the clock?   OS:  The clock is set.   DG:  Alright, on your marks, get set, go!   KN:  First up: After UCLA announced the move to online classes, more than 80% of students living in dorms on the Hill have moved out. The university has also set up a system for students who left UCLA without their stuff but still just want to cancel their housing contracts and expects more students to move out over time.   MCM:  To help ease the pressure students are feeling, the UCLA Academic Senate voted to let students avoid changes to their GPAs by taking multiple classes pass/no pass for spring quarter. The UC is also relaxing its admission requirements  high school seniors applying to the UC this fall wont have to submit SAT or ACT scores, and all high school students will also be able to take their required classes on a pass/fail basis for this years winter, spring, winter and summer sessions, no matter when they apply.   DG:  Alright, you did undergraduates and high school students, so now you have to do one about grad students.   KN:  Graduate students are still facing cost-of-living issues. UCLA graduate students are considering whether to go on strike without the support of their union. Grad students are once again hoping for a union-backed strike, but many are planning to launch a strike with or without the unions support, including UCLA Graduate Students Association President Zak Fisher.   MCM:  Meanwhile, to counter cost-of-living issues caused by the financial impacts of COVID-19, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a ban on evictions across the state through the end of May. Newsom credited Los Angeles for putting in place a similar moratorium, issued more than a week earlier by LA Mayor Eric Garcetti.   DG:  Points to Marilyn for a good transition.   KN:  Speaking of LA, a new boat has arrived in the city from Naval Base San Diego  and not just any boat. This is the USNS Mercy  a Naval hospital ship that is now docked at the Port of Los Angeles to help hospitals struggling with capacity issues because of COVID-19 by taking care of patients whove tested negative for the coronavirus to free up beds.   DG:  Dont forget to mention how many people at UCLA are sick.   MCM:  Fourteen members of the UCLA community have tested positive for COVID-19 as of April 5. While the cases are increasing, most of the more recent cases were likely contracted off campus. Last months decision to suspend in-person classes will likely hamper further cases from spreading at UCLA, which has now extended online instruction through at least Aug. 28, the end of summer session A. No decision has been made yet about summer session C, which ends Sept. 11  six months after online instruction first began at UCLA.   DG:  Okay, now do a story that ties into online instruction.   KN:  UCLA students experienced Zoombombing during their first few days of spring quarter classes when internet trolls interrupted Zoom classes with racist messages and slurs. Zoombombing was a common issue in classes across America this week, including at USC. UCLA has made a commitment to fix the issue, announcing two days later that it was working with law enforcement to identify those who verbally attacked students in class, while Zoom has made changes that make it more difficult for trolls to hijack classes.   DG:  Youre doing great David, now bring it home.   MCM:  We interviewed students who lost their jobs on campus as a result of COVID-19. Many were planning to return to work at UCLA during spring quarter  a decision thats now out of their hands. Meanwhile, student employees on the Hill are mired in uncertainty  unsure whether to stay and work jobs that might not last, or to head for the relative safety of home. Three days after that, the University of California announced a commitment not to lay off any of its career employees because of COVID-19, though that won't help students much.   MCM, KN:  DONE!   OS:  And, thats time. Good job, you both just made it. So David, have you decided on a winner?   DG:  Ugh, wow you guys both did a great job. I can't pick a winner so, you guys both win.     MCM:  Lame.   KN:  Yeah.   DG:  That's my choice.   OS:  Alright, thats it for this absurd little game show weve set up. We have to move on now. Thank you all.  &nbsp;   Humans of UCLA at home    Omar Said:  Page 2: Humans of UCLA at home. In the midst of all this, its been hard for a lot of people to maintain their routines  without rigid schedules to stick to or places to be. Thats also created a great opportunity for people who are trying to do something different as a way to make isolation more bearable. With me again is Opinion editor Lucy Carroll  who decided a routine change is just what the Opinion desk needs right now.   Lucy Carroll:  This week, my assistant editors and I thought it might be a good idea to take a break from arguing to see what exactly the humans of UCLA are going through right now and how theyve been coping with all of this. We spoke with Aidan Arasasingham, a third-year global studies student whos the Government Relations chair for the University of California Student Association and an undergraduate representative for Associated Students UCLA. Arasasingham has been going through some rough patches with the recent isolation and remote instruction.   Aidan Arasasingham:  I'm not gonna to lie, it's been really difficult. I mean, thinking back to finals week, almost overnight, I had to move my entire life out of Westwood back home. Honestly, I miss my friends, and it's been difficult having access to the support system that I rely on when we're all so spread socially thin. And it's in times like this that you need to rely on your support system the most, but we're so spread socially distant, that it's difficult.   LC:  And its not just being separated from friends thats causing problems  Arasasingham is coping with a lot of the technical difficulties that make remote work and instruction inaccessible.   AA:  I know for a fact that I don't learn as well through a screen than in person. I mean, right now, my entire family, we're sharing the same Wi-Fi router, and I've been having problems all week with connection issues and with audio issues. And I'm not able to keep up with lecture or what a professor is saying when I get spotty audio and I miss entire chunks of lecture.   LC:  Despite the difficulties of remote instruction and being cooped up inside though, Arasasingham has found some silver linings to the situation.   AA:  I mean, I'm getting to spend more time with family, which I think is really good. And in a way, it's forcing all of us to put so much more effort into maintaining and building our, you know, friendships and relationships right now and making sure that we can't take friends for granted.   LC:  One thing thats made it easier for him to stay positive is a little moment that helped him see the way other people have been adapting and adjusting to whats going on in the world.   AA:  Home for me is near UC Irvine's campus, and I was definitely, you know, it was unexpected and surprising today to be woken up by car horn after car horn, especially when I haven't seen a car in the streets in days. And I went out and I looked and it was actually a car strike being put on by the COLA (cost-of-living adjustment) graduate students, you know, protesting for graduate basic needs and student labor support right now in the middle of the coronavirus crisis. And seeing that kind of energy and the power of student activism continue in new and innovative ways, even in the new reality we're living in, is incredibly powerful, and we need to keep up elevating these conversations of student basic needs, of student labor support and of graduates student basic needs during this time, you know, even if we have to find new and innovative ways to do it.   LC:  In that vein, Arasasingham said he thinks student political activism like that will be key as the pandemic continues.   AA:  I think we need to, you know, remain vocal and vigilant to make sure we're keeping a close eye on the way that UCLA and UC is handling the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, especially with regard to student basic needs  you know, our financial security, our academic support and, you know, support for our student workers. But at the same time, the onus can't be on us as students to make sure that we're pushing administration in the right direction. We need to have a much more inclusive dialogue and collaboration to make sure not only in these crisis decisions were included, but as we move on to the medium and longer term, as we move into recovery, students and student voices are centered in the process, and our needs are met. I'm optimistic going forward, but in the post-crisis UC recovery, students need to be at the center of this discussion, both on campus and statewide.   LC:  Thats certainly something I can agree with. It was good to hear from another student in the midst of all this.     OS:  What really struck me is the optimism he shows for the future, despite some of the negative things going on. Thanks, Lucy.     &nbsp;   COVID-19 steals the show    Omar Said:  Page 3: COVID-19 steals the show. UCLA is home to the School of Theater, Film and Television  more commonly known as TFT. The school houses 692 students: directors, editors, actors and costume designers, among other specialized fields. As a result of social distancing guidelines, those students have had to adjust to many changes, starting with the decision to put their plays, movies and film projects on hold. Arts editor Kristin Snyder tells us more.   Kristin Snyder:  So, truth be told, this situation is not ideal. Not for me, and apparently very much not for TFT students. Not only are they coping with stalled movies and film projects, theyre now dealing with the fact that many of their classes require access to expensive programs and equipment thats normally available on campus, making it difficult for them to practice editing or doing the work they normally would for their classes.   OS:  And just what kind of programs and equipment is it that students need access to? I understand the need for cameras and filming equipment, but dont they have to stop filming right now anyway?   KS:  Well, aside from filming, TFT students learn a lot of other skills. Those learning to edit need access to editing software normally available to them in editing bays in Melnitz Hall. There are also students who need access to the buildings virtual reality labs in Melnitz, where they can use VR headsets. I dont know what that alls about, but it seems like TFT is really up to some high-tech work these days. What I do know is that VR headsets and editing programs arent cheap  and that a lot of students might have more pressing expenses, including rent and internet.   OS:  It seems unfair to leave that expense on students. Especially considering theyre still paying for access to those things on campus  that money is now going toward nothing. Even students who can afford to buy their own VR headsets or editing programs are essentially paying twice.   KS:  Its funny you should bring that up. A lot of TFT students feel the same way  and they want the professional fees they pay for access to this technology back. And its not as if the university has come up with a good alternative. Victor Rocha, a fourth-year film and television student and former Daily Bruin contributor whos co-head of the undergraduate student council for film, told us he felt like most of TFT is now dependent on students having access to their own software and VR headsets  meaning students cant fully and meaningfully participate in their classes without spending money on big-ticket items.   OS:  Online instruction really has been a challenge  Im sure South Campus lab courses are dealing with similar issues, albeit on a smaller scale. I think its clear at this point that online instruction will never be the same as the in-person instruction students would get in a classroom. For the most part, online learning really will be about students finding a way to adjust to new ways of learning skills without doing it themselves  but Zoom does offer its own perks, like its screen-sharing features, and the fact that no one has to walk to class anymore. That may not mean much to everyone  but at least its some version of an upside.   KS:  Yeah, and it opens the possibility of inviting guests to Zoom into the classroom who wouldnt normally be able to come to UCLAs campus as a result of work or geography. Things will definitely be different these next few months. Heres hoping we all figure it out.   OS:  Heres hoping. Thanks Kristin.  &nbsp;   An indefinite timeout    Omar Said:  Page 4: An indefinite timeout. COVID-19 has made a pretty big impact on many parts of our lives  but its effects were most quickly apparent in the sports world, when collegiate athletics around the country began to shut down in mid-March. Around the same time, professional sports  including the NBA, NHL and MLB  also shut down, leaving sports fans with no games to watch, no statistics to track and no brackets to fill out. Here at the Daily Bruin, thats left members of our Sports desk with little to do but wait for things to return to normal. Sports editor Sam Connon takes a break from scrolling through Twitter to join me for the rest of the story.   Sam Connon:  Its been weird for sports fans these past few weeks, you know. Watching old games just isnt the same, and Im not used to this much downtime between heated head-to-head matchups, really . Some people have even resorted to watching marble races on YouTube.   OS:  And how have you been coping with it all? Did you find something to fill your time?   SC:  Well, people who know me know I'm a big movie and TV fan, so I cut through a big chunk of my watch list. I binged the second season of ""Westworld"" in one day so I could catch up before the new season, and I finally completed the Cornetto trilogy when I watched ""The World's End"" last Tuesday  it's absolutely hilarious, would definitely recommend. And after I ran out of movies to watch, I talked with our social and graphics teams to set up a March Madness bracket on the Daily Bruin Sports Twitter account to pick the best UCLA athlete of the school year.   OS:  Were you rooting for anyone to win? Who won it in the end?   SC:  Well, I was really pulling for Matt McLain, Michaela Onyenwere, Kyle Philips and maybe a few others, but it's been clear since the beginning who the champion was going to be  Kyla Ross. We still have a few rounds left, but the field is thinning out and I can't imagine anyone pulling off that upset. She's just an all-time great and a total people's champion too.  Truth be told, the hardest thing about all this has been some of the recent news from the NCAA. The people most affected by these cancellations are the athletes, and the NCAA has actually been working on a solution. It gave athletes who play spring sports an extra year of eligibility  that includes sports like baseball, softball, tennis and golf. But, unfortunately, that means winter sports like mens and womens basketball and gymnastics wont make the cut  well never get to see this years mens basketball team play in March Madness, and we really likely would have without COVID-19. This cutoff means we wont have a chance to see athletes like Kyla Ross and Prince Ali donning blue and gold again. Anyway, aside from that, there obviously hasnt been much happening on fields or courts anywhere around the country.   OS:  Hey, Sam, what's that noise?   SC:  Oh, I didn't think the microphone would pick that up. I'm playing NBA 2K20. Hang on, let me turn it down. You would not believe how many hours I've put into this game over the last few weeks - really been getting my MyPlayer up.  So, we recently wrote a Battle of the Editors, facing off to decide what UCLAs best moment of this year was  although I dont think we really decided on anything in the end.  Really, I think after fighting it out, we just realized how impressive so many of UCLAs teams have been this year. Be it mens basketball  which managed to become one of Americas top college basketball teams after capping off a seven-game winning streak with last-minute wins over Arizona and Arizona State  or gymnastics  which once again made it into the internet hall of fame with a viral Beyonc-themed routine performed by Nia Dennis  UCLA Athletics managed to overshoot expectations in more ways than one this year. Im just sad I didnt get to see them do it longer.   SC:  So, yeah, as you can see, my hands are anything but full. Overall, though, I'm just hoping UCLA Athletics comes back strong next year. In the meantime, Im going back to Twitter  at least until a new marble-race video comes out.   OS:  Thank you, Sam. Enjoy your marbles.  &nbsp;   We're still on Postmates    Omar Said:  Page 5: We're still on Postmates. Students are going through a lot right now, but so is the entire country. That includes Westwood businesses that many students have forgotten about while they were worrying about a pandemic, online classes and missing out on commencement. Quad editor Molly Wright tells us now how Westwood small businesses are adjusting to COVID-19.   Molly Wright:  Every summer, most students pack up their things and leave Westwood, bound for home, study abroad sessions and summer-vacation destinations across the globe. This year, that exodus, or a version of it, came early as a result of COVID-19 and the resulting migration of classes online and campus closure  an acceleration that is threatening small businesses Bruins know and love in Westwood Village, like Enzos Pizzeria, Fat Sals and Espresso Profeta. While students may not have left for vacation this time, many of them are home  and that means theyre not around to spend money at Westwood businesses.  No one yet knows how long it will be before students are back in Westwood and can once again make the decision to skip 8 a.m. lectures in Royce Hall, but one thing is clear: Their absence will surely be felt by the small businesses that rely on students for most of their demand.   OS:  And just how bad are things going for small businesses right now? I know there are still some students living in their Westwood apartments, or like the dorms on campus. Are the restaurants at least still getting any business?   MW:  Well, a lot of the restaurants are still open for delivery, takeout, or both, which helps them make up some business, but theres a limit to even that. The restaurants are also having to deal with the fact that the students staying behind arent going out  meaning theres less foot traffic, and fewer people buying takeout. Between students leaving Westwood, and those left behind staying indoors as a result of social distancing guidelines, some restaurants have seen their business decrease by 70% in a single day.   OS:  Thats really worrying to hear, and Im sure students would hate to come back to UCLA to find their favorite restaurants closed. I know some restaurants have chosen to become small markets to make up money by selling their food stocks. That sounds like a good way to get groceries while avoiding crowded grocery stores. Is there any other way for restaurants to make money right now?   MW:  Well, besides continuing to offer delivery and takeout, many restaurants in Westwood and across America also offer gift cards and gift certificates. Recently, people have been focusing on buying those as a way to help restaurants, because it gives restaurants money to pay bills now, and people can use the gift cards once social guidelines have relaxed and things have returned to normal.   OS:  Thats good to know. I might try that out myself. In the meantime, Im keeping my fingers crossed my favorite restaurant manages to stay open through this pandemic. I know there are bigger things to worry about, but they really have the best poke. Thanks again, Molly.   OS:  Thats our show. Well be back again next week with another episode of The Online Edition.

The graduate student at the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz Performance at UCLA plays the jazz piano with his personal quintet, Banned, which has recently begun to sonically explore liberation in the form of removing self-inflicted constraints. Cornish said he was able to develop his musical voice through Banned,   and eventually began composing performances based on the idea of liberating people from self-imposed restrictions.  We have personal inhibitions or personal boundaries that we set on ourselves that we are capable of freeing ourselves from, and so I wanted my music to reflect that, Cornish said. (Liberation is the ability) to express ourselves, whatever that may look like for any specific person.   [Related:    Jazz student, ensemble strike a chord with expressive and experimental tunes   ]   The composition aims to free audience members by setting out a familiar melody and   subsequently disrupting this melody by the end of the composition Cornish said. But creating music for the five performers posed a particular challenge to him, as he found it difficult to sonically describe feelings of liberation.   Yet, Cornish said listeners react to music in different ways, so he has decided to collaborate with his fellow band members to define multiple meanings of liberation before performing the piece.  I think the beauty of (the composition) is finding a middle ground ... of everyone playing together and a finding way out of whatever we get ourselves into, Cornish said. I picked those specific players ... (because they were) people who are open to listening to each other, finding solutions in the music no matter what happens, even though Ive set a certain parameter or a certain idea to the music.    Cornish said he collaborated easily with Lenard Simpson, an alto saxophonist in the Herbie Hancock Institute masters program,   who joined Banned as well. Simpson said the quintet's chemistry was natural from its first rehearsal because of the complementary nature of their playing, so the group has since performed three times.  Banned had a fourth performance scheduled for April 15 at the Fowler Museum, which has now been postponed.   Simpson said he feels the performance will be particularly necessary after COVID-19 social distancing requirements have been lifted, as it will touch on the importance of community as well as liberation from constraints that have been placed on physical interactions.  Music is a communal thing that we all do together,""   Simpson said. ""When we play, theres no difference between me and the audience, were in this together. ... (We) come together and try to spread love and peace in our music.   [Related:    Students solo guitar EP to spin traditional jazz styles with playful style   ]   Emma Dayhuff, graduate student at the Herbie Hancock Institute and bassist for Banned,   said she taught, performed, and composed her own jazz music at the institute before restrictions on performance were implemented. These activities and Banned's performances have since been halted because of COVID-19, but Dayhuff said she still works on developing her composition skills by layering pre-recorded tracks from her bandmates into a cohesive song.  Its a neat process, but it takes out all the interaction ... especially (for) me, (as a bassist) because everyone else can interact with what Ive played but I cannot, Dayhuff said. So theres not any back and forth.  While performances have been limited, Cornish said he is developing his composition skills by taking music history classes and working on electronic tracks that don't require in-person playing to accommodate for the quarantine lifestyle. Performances for Banned are not over, and Cornish said he is hopeful that future ventures will be able to continue sometime soon.  The whole idea behind (Banned) ... is that through the struggles of the people that came before us, we are able to have the freedoms we have today, Cornish said. Especially after all of this, we would all have a lot to say (on liberation).",['cap-tara-oldenburg'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ae_.paulcornish.courtesy.jpg

I was a kid from San Francisco about to call enemy territory home for the next four years. I was well aware of the smoke that was about to come my way, but I wanted all of it.  The 49ers were in the Super Bowl not that long ago, the Giants were two years removed from three championships in five years and the Warriors on their way to having the best basketball season ever.  Then LeBron happened.  He aggravated Draymond Green just enough to get him suspended for Game 5, scored 109 points in the final three games and made &#8211; the block &#8211;  that ESPN replays a little too often if you ask me.  My confidence heading into Los Angeles took a hit and basketball was a touchy subject for a few weeks, until the Warriors signed Kevin Durant. Then I was fine.  My passion for sports and writing made my decision to join the Daily Bruin not feel like a decision at all.  I wrote for the school paper my senior year of high school. The Paper Tiger at Lick-Wilmerding High School wasn&#8217;t split up into sections the way the Daily Bruin is. Its staff was about 15 people, so we were able to write about anything as long as it stayed relevant to the area or students&#8217; interest.  But everybody knew that sports journalism was where my heart was at. My friend, George Dicke, and I were coined ""the sports section"" by our teacher Ms. Von Breton. It might&#8217;ve been my sports passion that made me want to continue journalism in college, but it was Ms. Von Breton&#8217;s support and guidance that made me believe I could.  And my time at Daily Bruin and at UCLA in general made me learn so much about myself.  This may seem hard to believe now, but I was pretty shy growing up. Or at least I thought that was the right word to use.  I hate that word. Shy. A little kid is shy, but they eventually grow out of it. There are certain connotations of that word that don&#8217;t fit the description of Marcus Veal at all. I love being around people, but there are also times where I am more than okay being by myself for a while. I was quiet in the classroom, on the court, on the diamond and even when around friends. Of course if I was called on or if I had something to say, I would say it, but the main way I expressed my thoughts and creativity was through my fingertips. On the keyboard of a computer or on the valves of a trumpet.  I was someone who I guess was a little shy but not entirely. I figured there&#8217;s a word for it, but I just couldn&#8217;t quite put my finger on it.  Until one night when I grabbed De Neve Late Night with a friend.  We were at Late Night for two hours, talking about life and when I told her my dilemma, she gave me the phrase I was searching for my whole life.  &#8220;You&#8217;re an extroverted introvert.&#8221;  There it is.  I love meeting new people and learning their life stories, but I can only endure so much socializing. My first impression is nowhere near my real personality. My inner circle is just as big as my outer circle, but I have tendencies to latch onto the same people for a while.   If I don&#8217;t like somebody, which rarely happens, there&#8217;s really nothing they can do to change that. Although, that might just be a Taurus thing. I learned quite a lot of astrology during these four years, too. In a group of people, I don&#8217;t try to ""work the room"" or be the ""most popular."" I am very OK with that. And lastly, I take pride in how observant and open-minded I am, and I think I&#8217;m a good journalist because of it.  But enough about me, I wrote this column to say thank you.  Thank you Michael Hull, for showing me the ropes from the start and for introducing me to the beautiful game of water polo. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better first editor.  Thank you Nick Yekikian, for not only putting me on the softball beat but also for the baseball talks and the check-ins. Despite you being an LA Dodgers fan, I&#8217;m grateful that the Daily Bruin allowed us to meet and become friends.  Thank you to all the editors I&#8217;ve been able to work with these past four years. As a writer, you guys were exactly the right people I needed to be around as the incredible and hard-working people that I looked up to each and every day.  Thank you to the players, coaches and sports information directors I was fortunate to work with, and I wish you all the best of luck.  It&#8217;s been four years I&#8217;ll never forget. And because of that, I&#8217;m forever grateful.   Veal was a Sports contributor 2016-2017 and reporter 2017-2020.

The group of four made a name for itself in the indie pop genre with its debut EP, Sweet FA, in 2016. The tracks dulcet and tender vocals, juxtaposed by crooning electric guitar solos, narrate a cautionary tale about loves intoxicating power.  Following its initial debut, Peach Pit released its studio album, Being so Normal only a year later. The lead single, Alrighty Aphrodite, boasts a mellow yet robust sound, earning it a slot on Billboard Canada Rock Top 50. Lead vocalist Neil Smith bitterly laments an unsatisfied lover in the track, textured by the albums signature light percussion and eerie bassline.  Since then, Peach Pit has performed at music festivals like Bonnaroo and Shaky Knees, fully establishing itself in the indie scene. The bands upcoming album, You and Your Friends, will be released Friday, followed by the beginning of its summer European tour. So as spring arrives in full bloom, Peach Pits popularity will surely follow suit.   - Vivian Xu   [caption id=""attachment_377921"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""480""]  (Courtesy of Moonstone Recordings)[/caption]     Raveena   Its like a soul band fell into a vat of rainbow sherbert ice cream, reads one YouTube comment under Raveena Auroras  NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert .  Professionally known as Raveena, the singer-songwriter combines R&amp;B and soul to create a dream pop sound of her own, releasing her first EP Shanti in 2017. Laid-back percussion beats coated with brighter bursts of guitar and keyboards effortlessly cultivate Raveenas breezy environment. Raveenas songs soothing nature makes them perfect to play while lying in the grass on a sunny day or dipping into a bubble bath.  Under the soft groove of her instrumentals, however, Raveena weaves more serious topics into her lyrics. In Salt Water from her 2019 album Lucid, she sings about trauma from being sexually assaulted, with the title referencing her tears. The album closes with a spoken interlude from her grandmother and a track titled Petal, both suggesting the inevitability of death.  Beyond the more somber lyricism of her discography, Raveena also touches on growth and healing throughout her work. The album includes a song dedicated to her mother and one about being captivated by the little things in life while being in love, letting themes of empowerment and affection shine through her work.  Lucid, along with Raveenas releases since her debut, come full circle to show the darker frames of life, but also to pay homage to the people and places she loves, offering listeners a transparent look into her life while leaving them with uplifting messages.   - Anushka Jain      [Related:    Music Preview: Artists embody purpose by defining individual identities   ]   [caption id=""attachment_377922"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""480""]  (Courtesy of The Maras)[/caption]     The Maras   The velvet cushions pictured in The Maras first two EP covers suitably capture the bands lush and dreamy soundscape.  Its entrancing discography of English and Spanish tracks is amplified through grainy music videos featuring vintage and surrealist aesthetics. The LA-based band has garnered a sizable fanbase despite distributing music independently from the start, and have performed at multiple sold-out shows since 2017.  The Maras is the namesake of singer Mara, whose airy vocals imbue the group with its chill-inducing aura. And the chemistry between her partner and drummer Josh Conway feeds into palpably intimate lyrics like Im lost completely, I might as well be over the moon. Keyboardist Edward James, guitarist Jesse Perlman and bassist Carter Lee, help meld together a fusion of styles  from bossa nova to psychedelic soul  forming the band's signature sound.  Two singles released in March continue the bands musical exploration. The lyrics and ethereal-sounding synths in Hold It Together convey the intensifying feelings of love, whereas the lilting harmonies and laid-back guitar riffs in Jupiter embody the simple pleasures of being together.  The bands consistent delivery of boozy grooves and enchanting cadences may soon set them at the forefront of the indie scene.   - Alyson Kong   [caption id=""attachment_377923"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""640""]  (Courtesy of Andy Witchger/Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]     Liza Anne   Liza Anne just needs some space to figure it out.  Though her style has shifted over time, Anne has successfully transitioned from her soft indie albums The Colder Months and Two to become a burgeoning indie rock powerhouse. The Nashville-based singers single, Desire, which dropped early March, continues her devotion to emotionally honest lyrics accompanied by swelling beats.  With her 2018 album Fine But Dying, Anne layers intense drumming and smooth bass lines as she deepens her vocals. Her new indie rock sound is accompanied by an increased dedication to vulnerability. While her previous work didnt lack depth, Anne  told Billboard  she viewed Fine But Dying as a discussion with her depression and panic disorder.  Such honesty comes through in Panic Attack, which features catchy yet somber lines such as I think I wanna die/ But I guess I know Im fine and My body is here and I am inside. Pairing her melancholy with brisk rhythms prevents the album from becoming too bleak without sacrificing the nuance of her emotions. More hopeful songs, like her 2019 single Devotion, highlight self-love in a flurry of jubilant lyrics and energetic beats.  Whether she documents hurting those that she loves and or struggling to show kindness, Anne always makes good on her tagline of putting sound to feeling.   - Kristin Snyder       [Related:    Music Preview: Spring quarter album releases will focus on returning to raw, personal writing   ]   [caption id=""attachment_377924"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""384""]  (Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]     Matt Maeson   Matt Maesons alternative rock and acoustic style lyrically battle concepts of life and death.  Spending his adolescence performing in prisons with his parents, Maesons unorthodox upbringing echoes in the mournful yet redemptive undertones of his music. His first EP Who Killed Matt Maeson, which features his radio hit Cringe, establishes his soul-baring lyrics and pounding instrumentals. The 27-year-old singer-songwriter has since performed at Lollapalooza in 2018 and released his debut album Bank On The Funeral in 2019.  Maesons discography features authentic lyrics that grapple with personal growth, generating relatable themes for all misfits. And along with his studio releases, Maeson often publishes stripped versions of his music, showcasing his emotional depth through the resilience of his voice.  Even beyond his music, Maesons quirky personality  like his self-written Spotify biography about purchasing a salad only to drop it on the floor  shows how the artist is consistently true to himself. Maeson, as alive as ever, has been holding impromptu acoustic concerts on Instagram and YouTube and will be spending the remainder of 2020 touring with KALEO.  Since releasing his Amazon original single We Were The Same in February, Maeson appeared on a billboard in Times Square and has left fans itching for his highly anticipated second studio album.   - Yasmin Madjidi ","['cap-kristin-snyder', 'cap-alyson-kong', 'cap-vivian-xu', 'cap-yasmin-madjidi', 'cap-anushka-jain']","['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/spring-up-and-coming-1024x768.png

With just pliers and coils of wire, the second-year business economics student started her own metal wire jewelry business, Maia Hawaiian Jewelry, last August in person and recently moved it onto Etsy. Using her wire-working skills, Zoraster said she draws upon her Hawaiian heritage to craft pieces that feature traditional symbols and evoke the islands natural elements.  I really love the whole process of making jewelry and spreading it to other people, Zoraster said. It feels like Im spreading the aloha and culture of where I grew up to people on the mainland.  As an experienced artist, Zoraster discovered metalworking in a high school jewelry class, where she said the medium pushed her to extend her work past two-dimensional pieces and ceramics. Her business specializes in wire-worked jewelry, a subset of metalworking that utilizes pliers to bend and manipulate wires into a desired shape, she said.  [caption id=""attachment_379728"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Zoraster first began metalworking in a high school jewelry class. (Amy Dixon/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  The simplicity of wire can be deceiving, Zoraster said, since its plainness hides the versatility of the material. Wire can be bent into many different planes  just a twist of the pliers can transform a piece from occupying two dimensions to three dimensions. Its malleability also encourages experimentation, since designs can be easily changed during any time of the jewelrys creation, she said.  Wire is kind of like a string, and if you take the string, you can play with it to turn it into something, Zoraster said. It can be frustrating when the wires not cooperating, but the nice thing about wire (is that) its very forgiving.   [Related:    Student reaches for stars while supporting family with personal business   ]   All of Maia Hawaiian Jewlerys wire pieces are infused with Zorasters Hawaiian culture and the tropical environment she grew up around. The word maia is Hawaiian for banana, which is symbolic of her upbringing growing bananas on her familys small farm. Her childhood home looks out onto Kne'ohe Bay, with the mountains and the Pacific Ocean within eyesight. This scenic view, combined with natural textures like heliconia petals and mango tree leaves that Zoraster finds in her tropical surroundings, serve as inspiration for many of her jewelry designs.  Her Maia Signature Necklace, a round pendant that depicts Kneohe Bay, features a spiral that symbolizes the Hawaiian peoples spirit and the islands nature, Zoraster said. This spiral motif is also found in her square spiral Ikaika Earrings, which she said are named after the Hawaiian word for strength and represent community. However, Zoraster said her most popular earrings by far are the Mana Earrings, which are circular spirals made of silver wire.  The spiral shape is symbolic of Hawaiian petroglyphs, Zoraster said. Its this circle of life that represents lifes spirit and the connection to the land. The ina means the spirit of the people on the land, (which) is also what 'mana' means.

Sukhov said he noticed a mutual friend of his and Zorasters wearing the earrings, which immediately struck him as the ideal gift for his younger sister.  I love it when something is loud but subtle at the same time  I felt that these earrings were perfectly that, Sukhov said. Its bigger than a quarter, so its not a small earring, but its just a thin wire doing the spiraling. They were subtle (but) they popped.   [Related:    Alumna runs custom clay jewelry business through instagram DMs   ]   Maya Chari, another owner of the Mana Earrings and a first-year computational and systems biology student, said her close relationship with Zoraster enhances the significance of her pieces. After meeting in The UCLA Backpacking Club, Zoraster introduced Chari to her Hawaiian-inspired art, which Chari found to be very personal. Zorasters close cultural ties to her home manifest in the natural themes found in her pieces, Chari said.  Knowing (Zoraster) as a person makes it more meaningful to be able to wear her jewelry, Chari said. I know how much time she puts into it and what her jewelry means to her, what her art means to her. ... I think thats (what makes it) really special.  Since Zoraster launched Maia Hawaiian Jewelry more than half a year ago, she said the business has become a significant part of her life. She was initially hesitant to sell her pieces, but now she said she has found unexpected joy in the process, from designing her jewelrys packaging to cultivating her brands image. Using her newfound time at home, Zoraster said she is reconnecting with her roots in hopes of finding inspiration to expand her inventory.

Tabitha Romero, a fourth-year political science student, was the first in her family to graduate from college, but her celebratory moment is mixed with anxieties for the future and the looming realities of food insecurity.  When the pandemic hit, her parents&#8217; janitorial business lost customers. Most of her parents&#8217; income, along with Romero&#8217;s income from her work-study job, now goes to rent. Romero&#8217;s CalFresh card is now spread thin to support a family of five.  &#8220;The CalFresh card was originally meant for my use,&#8221; Romero said. &#8220;The money isn't enough to feed my family for the entire month.&#8221;  Romero&#8217;s grocery trips now consist only of essential food items, such as grains, milk and eggs. Vegetables and fruits are off the table, she said. Romero said she tried to buy vegetables and fruits one month, so her family could eat a regular diet, but her CalFresh funds ran out on the 20th and didn&#8217;t refresh until the sixth of the next month.  &#8220;There were 16 days that we were really trying to grasp small bits of foods and trying to make things work,&#8221; Romero said.  Romero&#8217;s experience is shared by many other students at UCLA. Approximately half of undergraduate students and one-fourth of graduate students across University of California schools reported experiences of food insecurity, according to the most recent  survey  by the UC Global Food Initiative.  After the coronavirus hit, rates of household food insecurity doubled across the nation, according to a Brookings Institute  report .  Since mid-March, the Economic Crisis Response Team at UCLA has received two times more crisis case referrals than before the pandemic, said &#352;erifa Dela Cruz, UCLA&#8217;s economic crisis case manager. On average, UCLA students filing for funding lost just below $2,000 in wages, she added.  The ECRT distributes vouchers that students can exchange for dining hall meals. Students can apply for these vouchers via an online request form and pick them up at the Rieber Hall front desk.  ECRT&#8217;s vouchers come from Swipe Out Hunger, a student organization that collects dining hall swipe donations at the end of every quarter.  Swipe Out Hunger anticipates fewer donations post-pandemic, since fewer students live on the Hill and have a meal plan, said Celina Lee, an organizer at Swipe Out Hunger and a second-year human biology and society and philosophy student.  Swipe Out Hunger received increased donations winter quarter as students moved out early. Lee hopes that these surplus donations will help alleviate food insecurity for students who still live in Westwood.  The number of student requests for meal vouchers in spring quarter has dropped to 25% of the number of requests submitted in winter quarter, Dela Cruz said. This may mean that a higher proportion of students in Westwood are applying since most students have left the area, Dela Cruz added.  The UC created  b  asic needs reciprocity programs  across all UC campuses so UC students could access resources from any campus they live near. The UCLA Community Programs Office also created a  COVID-19 Basic Needs Resource Guide , which lists on- and off-campus organizations that provide UCLA students with basic reliefs.  UCLA has also taken other measures to lessen students&#8217; financial burdens in light of the pandemic.  In May, UCLA used federal funding allocated to them under the CARES Act to grant students a  universal $200 grant  to help cover COVID-19 related expenses. Over 16,000 UCLA students received the grant as of May 24, said Ina Sotomayor, the director of UCLA Financial Aid and Scholarships.  The Financial Aid and Scholarships office also provided additional need-based grants to 8,115 students who had previously filed for financial aid, as well as 2,200 undocumented and international students who are not eligible to receive federal funding.  Romero said the relief funds that she received from UCLA will help her and her family get through May, and possibly June, but her future remains unknown.  &#8220;(The relief funds) made me feel comforted, but not stable,&#8221; Romero said. &#8220;We aren't sure how long we can support ourselves.&#8221; ",['cap-wendy-li'],"['california', 'campus', 'news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.news_.food_.insecurity.file_.jpg

Graduate students across the UC held a general strike to demand a cost of living adjustment to their wages. As part of the strike, graduate students did not answer emails, hold lectures or sections, host office hours or grade assignments.  The demand for cost of living adjustments, or COLA, began at UC Santa Cruz in December, when graduate students went on strike and withheld fall quarter grades. Since then, graduate students across the UC campuses, including UCLA, have made similar demands.  Zak Fisher, a UCLA School of Law student and an organizer of Ucla4Cola, said his position as president of the Graduate Students Association for the 2019-2020 year allowed him to see how many students were affected by these issues.  Maybe a little people recognize that some people are suffering more than others, Fisher said. (But) everyone has that (metaphorical) boot on their neck, where while we're trying to deal with the tremendously stressful prospect of getting a PhD or law degree or an MBA or whatever, we can't afford housing, you know, we can't afford to eat.  Sucharita Kanjilal, a graduate student in UCLAs anthropology department, said that as an international student, she has been deeply affected by UCLAs low wages. Her visa places a limit on the number of hours she can work per week and restricts her from working outside campus, she said.  For people like me, you're basically kind of stuck here on the salary that UCLA pays you, and there's no room to sort of work outside that or make a little bit more to get by, Kanjilal said. So, what it does is it leaves you really precarious for the time that you're here.  Kanjilal added that working from home in the midst of the pandemic has caused teaching assistants to have more responsibilities.  It ended up being a significant amount of work, to actually design the courses to make them run but also to do all the emotional support for faculty who were freaking out because they didn't know how to do this online and undergrads who were freaking out because they're experiencing so many challenges, Kanjilal said.  Fisher said Ucla4Cola will follow the law and university policies but will push it to the limit to fight for cost of living adjustments.  Now it is time to fight for changes to that reality with everything that we have, as if our lives depended on, because in many cases they really do, Fisher said.  United Auto Workers Local 2865, a union that represents over 19,000 UC student workers also held an all-day series of teach-ins, actions and panels Friday. The union has also been organizing for COLA adjustments for UC workers.  Rafael Jaime is a graduate student in the UCLA English department and the southern vice president of UAW Local 2865. He said he believes a cost of living adjustment is necessary for graduate students because they bear a lot of work and are the backbone of the University.  We have a saying in our union that our working conditions are our students learning conditions, and if the University wants to prioritize education, diversity and fulfill its goals to provide a world class education, then it also needs to prioritize our own conditions, Jaime said.  Jaime added that the pandemic and the stay-at-home orders have made organizing a little more difficult because the traditional aspects of a strike, such as rallies and pickets, are no longer viable.  However, he said, UAW Local 2865 has continued to hold weekly phone banking drives, in which UAW Local 2865 workers joined a Zoom meeting to call and ask other university workers to sign the Unfair Labor Practice Strike Pledge, which would authorize a strike to withhold labor if COLA demands are not met and if unfair labor practices persist.  Jaime moderated one of the unions panels on Friday, in which he spoke with UCLA professors and leaders of various UC unions about the UCs anticipated responses to the pandemic and to the recession.  Mia McIver, a lecturer at UCLAs writing programs and president of the University Council  American Federation of Teachers, a union representing librarians and non-Senate faculty working at the UC, said at the panel that she anticipates there will be higher enrollment of out-of-state students, more crowded classes, less feedback on work and a reduction in student support services because of the potential recession.  McIver said she believes it will take students longer to graduate, which might cause the UC administration to lower the requirements for undergraduate graduation.  Some students might see (lowered graduation requirements) as lessening the burden, McIver said. From my perspective it ... will diminish the quality of the UC education.  McIver said she also predicts a dramatic loss of teaching faculty jobs, causing tenured faculty who are more accustomed to doing research to have to teach more.  Claudia Preparata is the research director for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, which represents service and patient care technical workers and is the UCs largest employee union. She said at the panel that it is important to think of the UC system as both an educator and as a billion dollar enterprise.  As the third-largest employer in California, she said, the UC is in a position to influence the outcome of the economic recession.  So, first and foremost, the University needs to maintain full employment, as well as ensure that the education is both quality education, as well as affordable, Preparata said.

464,/2020/05/19/student-created-app-charipay-streamlines-process-of-donating-to-charity/,180.0,166.0,172,143.0,0.8741,0.7833,$0.00,Student-created app Charipay streamlines process of donating to charity,https://dailybruin.com/2020/05/19/student-created-app-charipay-streamlines-process-of-donating-to-charity/,"Wed, 20 May 2020 02:34:45 +0000",Camayak_04fbdce3f0," Some UCLA students felt that the process of donating to charity needed to be quicker, easier and more transparent. As a solution to this, they made an app.  In 2019, a group of UCLA students founded Charipay, a startup that lets people donate directly to partner charities using an iOS app. The app now features over 40 charities, including one established by the Charipay team itself for coronavirus relief.  Even when he wanted to help a cause, it was often difficult and time-consuming to find a trustworthy charity, said Kevin Yu, a Charipay co-founder and fourth-year economics and cognitive science student.  Charipay was founded to address this need, said Kyler Gilbert, a Charipay co-founder and fourth-year communication and economics student. Gilbert was the first to come up with the idea for the app.  Users can browse the app for causes to donate to or use the search option to find specific charities or causes. The app keeps track of every cause the user has donated to on their profile.  Samantha Chandra, a fourth-year business economics student, said that before she used Charipay, she often considered donating to charities but never followed through because of all the research required.  She recently donated to Charipay&#8217;s COVID-19 fund.  &#8220;Once I linked (my credit card), it makes it very easy. ... It's almost like Venmo,&#8221; Chandra said.  The Charipay team never touches the donations; donations are processed through an online payment technology called Stripe, Gilbert said.  The team also researches every charity that joins the platform to ensure they are transparent about how they use their funds, Gilbert added.  Because Charipay is a small startup, one of the biggest challenges has been gaining the trust of organizations, Gilbert said.  &#8220;It's so easy for charities to stick with what they have right now,&#8221; said Abdullah Elqaq, another co-founder of Charipay and a third-year computer engineering student.  This challenge made the first charity joining the platform all the more exciting for them, Elqaq said.  Many charities have joined since then. They recently received a message from Make-A-Wish Hawaii, a charity they had hoped to work with since the beginning, Gilbert said.  In the future, the team hopes to implement more social media features, allowing users to share causes with each other. The purpose would not be to flaunt donations, but to give charitable causes more publicity through users&#8217; social networks, said Jason Lim, the technical lead of Charipay and a first-year data theory student.  &#8220;(We&#8217;re) allowing people to read more about and to get educated about how they're helping these specific areas,&#8221; Gilbert said.   Charipay COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund   Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus outbreak, the team has put most of its work toward Charipay&#8217;s own charity, the Charipay COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund.  Charipay uses donations to the fund to purchase personal protective equipment, or PPE, directly from manufacturers. Team members then personally deliver the PPE to medical centers, including The Queen&#8217;s Medical Center in Hawaii, St. Joseph Health in Texas and California, MemorialCare Long Beach Medical Center and UCLA Health.  Their first shipment of PPE arrived recently, which included over 1,200 face shields and over 1,000 masks, Gilbert said.  Graham Tse, the chief medical officer at MemorialCare Miller Children's &amp; Women's Hospital Long Beach, said donations like Charipay&#8217;s help hospitals prepare for what they expect to be a long-term situation.  &#8220;It&#8217;s ensuring that we have enough PPE not just today, but two months down the road, four months down the road, a year from now,&#8221; Tse said.  Lim and Elqaq both said they appreciate the ability to make a positive difference through Charipay.  &#8220;I&#8217;d taken on (other projects) before but this is the first one that kind of had more of a philanthropic side to it,&#8221; Elqaq said. &#8220;Which I thought was really cool.&#8221; ",['cap-maddie-rausa'],['a-closer-look'],https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.news_.charipay.SJ_.jpg

OK, I&#8217;m not actually all that alone &#8211; I&#8217;m just in quarantine &#8211; and I&#8217;m not actually in Arkansas, I&#8217;m back in my hometown in southern California. Still, Frank Ocean's lyrics resonated with me.   Prior to quarantine, I hadn&#8217;t listened to a single one of Frank Ocean&#8217;s songs. But on nights when I feel especially removed from my pre-quarantine life and overwhelmed by the current state of things, there&#8217;s nothing better than retreating into my own musical world &#8211; and taking Frank Ocean along with me.   As it turns out, I&#8217;m not alone in my gravitation toward music at a time like this. In fact, my changed relationship with music is a form of coping that has piqued many researchers' interests.  David Frederick, an associate professor of health psychology at Chapman University and visiting associate professor at UCLA, led the  Chapman University COVID-19 Spring 2020 National Mental Health Study , which examined the impact that COVID-19 has had on bringing about negative emotions.  &#8220;Over half of people are reporting more stress, anxiety, and/or depression compared to normal because of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; Frederick said in an email  ed statement. &#8220;Change by itself can be overwhelming, and then added to it is more uncertainty about the future, fears about the health of loved ones, and many people losing their jobs or job security.&#8221;  [caption caption=""Many have turned to music during quarantine &#8211; a time of limited movement. (Photo Illustration by Alex Driscoll/Daily Bruin)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_382011"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]  Moreover, the study found that commonly used coping mechanisms revolved around distracting oneself, which might not always be the most effective. Only those who &#8220;positively reframed&#8221; their experiences by looking for a silver lining amid the current chaos reported the best overall mental health, Frederick said.  In situations like quarantine when our lives are defined by stagnancy, this positive reframing can be achieved through things that do not require us to move around much &#8211; things such as listening to music.   Robert Fink, a professor of music industry musicology and the current chair of the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music&#8217;s music industry minor, said that with nowhere to go, we often turn to music for how it makes us feel.  &#8220;If we&#8217;re stuck at home and we&#8217;re in a situation where you can&#8217;t party and be around friends, you&#8217;re more open to experiences that are offered to you,&#8221; Fink said. &#8220;These experiences offer you intimacy. This is one of the functions that music has &#8211; the notion of intimacy.&#8221;    We often feel this kind of intimacy by simply being in another person's presence. But with no one around us nowadays, people are diving into music now more than ever to help replace the intimacy of in-person interaction.   For Tristan Ganzon, a third-year sociology student, his relationship with music became a way to maintain a connection to the outside world during quarantine. To achieve this, Ganzon began making personalized playlists for people in his life.  &#8220;I find solace in music,&#8221; Ganzon said. &#8220;With quarantine going on, and our need to communicate with one another, I found that making people playlists was an indirect way of reaching out to them.&#8221;  Many people like Ganzon are finding that their passion for music now serves a dual purpose: It is no longer just about enjoying the music but also about forming a bond with others.   However, the effects of music don't stop at emotional connectivity. The reactions music can elicit in us are manifold and can be physical as well as emotional.  At the base of our response to music is the concept of entrainment, which is the synchronization of our movements to different rhythms. Fink uses music at a rave as an example: He said its upbeat tempo would entrain our body to that rhythm, piquing our physical arousal and causing us to move to the beat.  With this power that music has over our bodily responses, we can see how it can influence our emotional state. During quarantine, people face different obstacles: Some are overwhelmed and overworking and thus need music that keeps them calm, while some are dealing with depressive feelings and thus look for upbeat music to keep them going, Fink said.  It&#8217;s therefore easy for us to attach our own feelings to a song,   which opens the door to a potential catharsis. That specific song you&#8217;re listening to becomes, in some ways, a surrogate voice for your own feelings, Fink said.  This role of the ""surrogate voice"" is something that Frank Ocean does well. His raw, personal storytelling lyricism fosters an emotional connection between himself and the listener.  Take his hit song ""Ivy"" as an example. A  GQ article  described the song as ""at once direct and ambiguous"" and cites the song's tremolo guitar melodies and high-pitched, childlike voice as the forces that come together to make the listener feel nostalgic, sad, hopeful and everything in between.  [caption caption=""Listeners can connect to songs by applying their own feelings to them. (Alex Driscoll/Daily Bruin)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_382012"" width=""682""]   [/caption]  We can see that artists have been able to foster a sense of intimacy and connection through their music &#8211; but how do they do it?  It all has to do with a simple recording device: the microphone. When the first successful electrical recording technique was invented in 1925, the Western musical landscape fundamentally shifted.  &#8220;Before that time, if you wanted to reach a large group of people with your voice, you had to be loud,&#8221; Fink said. &#8220;Recording people singing into a microphone suddenly made it possible to create a sound artifact that could transmit to an arbitrarily large amount of people and mimic the effect of someone singing into your ear.&#8221;  Billie Eilish is a popular representation of this music-fostered intimacy, Fink said. She situates the microphone extremely close to her mouth and is thus a perfect example of an artist who curates an intimate musical experience. This creates an emotionally intense connection between the artist and listener.   So, if you feel yourself getting dragged down by the dull hum of isolation, try forming connections with new artists. According to Ganzon, exploring a new sound and vibe can be an exciting experience during this time of confinement.   For me, diving into Frank Ocean's music for the first time allowed me to positively reframe my reality and search for emotional connectivity in a way I never had before. For many other Bruins in quarantine, embracing music can create similar effects.  &#8220;Enjoying music, sharing music and finding music has greatly reduced the anxiety that this pandemic has caused,"" Ganzon said. ""It calms me down and simultaneously allows me to share this sense of calm with others who share my passion for music. I wish life was as easy as putting together a playlist.&#8221; ",['cap-audrey-pham'],"['ae', 'lifestyle-quad', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/feelsy-1024x768.jpeg

Coach Michael Sealy announced four new UCLA women's volleyball recruits on Apr. 29, bringing the 2020 recruiting class to a total of eight players.  Outside hitter Skyler Canady, setter/opposite Kate Lane, setter Audrey Pak and opposite Gabby Sonnhalter joined outside hitter Allison Jacobs and opposite Iman Ndiaye as the six incoming freshmen in the class. Transfers junior libero Zoe Fleck and junior outside hitter lan McCall also committed to joining UCLA, coming from UC Santa Barbara and TCU, respectively.  After a fourth-place conference finish in the 2019 season, Sealy said his eight new additions include a few players ready to make an immediate impact, especially two players signed before this latest wave of recruits.  With someone like (Ndiaye) and (Jacobs), you got kids that have played at a really high level and have a lot of international experience, Sealy said.  Ndiaye  a 6-foot-2 freshman from Plano, Texas with dual citizenship shared between the United States and France  was ranked seventh in the nation as a recruit by PrepVolleyball.com, and was the MVP of the USA Volleyball Girls Junior National Championships in the summer of 2019.  With similar high-level competition in her background, the 5-foot-11 Jacobs won a gold medal in the FIVB Girls U18 World Championship as a member of the U.S. Girls Youth National Team, and PrepVolleyball.com ranked her as the 39th-best recruit in the country.  Sealy said Jacobs has an on-court presence reminiscent of senior outside hitter Savvy Simo, who was named an honorable mention on the AVCA All-American list last season and has since graduated from the program.  The 11th-year UCLA coach also said, however, that the loss of Simos leadership may take the combined presence of as many as five new players to replace.  (Simo) holds such a strong presence, that maybe we dont have somebody thats going to fill it, Sealy said.  Jacobs, Canady and McCall were all recruited at Simos position, outside hitter, and will join the Bruins other 2019 All-American, junior Mac May, at that position.  McCall was named an Honorable Mention All-American with the Horned Frogs in her freshman season, but missed action with a leg injury and played just 14 times this past year.  Recruited setters Lane and Pak also join a squad that finished second in the Pac-12 in assists last season, averaging 13.19 per set on the campaign.  Sealy said the positionally diverse class has only communicated with him and the rest of the coaching staff through Zoom calls because of social distancing restrictions in place in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.  He also said the recruits shared an attitude that is valuable at the next level of volleyball.  They all bring something different to the table, Sealy said. The biggest impact that they have is that they have pretty good professional mindsets  they're coming for the right reasons.""",['cap-michael-waldman'],"['sports', 'womens-volleyball']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Image-from-iOS-3.jpg

Its what allowed them to successfully assimilate into a society that was hesitant about letting them in. Its what fostered the determination to become fluent in a language they werent exposed to until their early adult lives. Its what gave them the courage to leave their families and build a life from the ground up nearly 7,000 miles away.  Whatever hardships they had endured to get to where they are now, they would seem to simply grit and bear it  more invested in providing a comfortable life for me and my brother than for themselves.  Strength and resilience. I didnt realize just how much my parents had emulated these traits until they didnt anymore.  Just try to stay calm and do your best to move to a safer area, preferably where there are more people. I nodded silently to my fathers words as he listed possible scenarios out to me and provided directions for what to do in case each one played out in reality.  I picked at my food, no longer hungry, as my mother passively murmured in agreement to my fathers instructions.  Maybe we should bring Dad everywhere as our bodyguard, she joked in Mandarin. Despite her attempt to brighten the mood, her facial expression didn't mirror her lighthearted words.  This was the first time the curtains had lifted to reveal a fragile vulnerability I didnt know my parents had. I had subconsciously placed them on a pedestal above me, always looking up to the way nothing seemed impossible to them.  No task too challenging, no situation out of their control.   ""This was the first time the curtains had lifted to reveal a fragile vulnerability I didn't know my parents had."" I watched my father come home throughout the years with new job promotions and I grew to admire how my mother became more confident with every passing English conversation. To see all traces of their fierce resolve   replaced with furrowed brows and concerned eyes jolted me with the harsh reminder that my parents are still human  and just as susceptible as I am to experiencing fear.  My family, like many others, has been trying to stay up to date on the COVID-19 pandemic, a situation that seems to be evolving by the hour. Now, Ive grown used to the sound of the news blaring through the walls of my house. Snips of coronavirus and social distancing have become the equivalent of white noise to me.  But following the news means they've heard the   reports regarding the rise of incidents involving Asians facing verbal and physical  harassment  because of the coronavirus.  Which was how I ended up at my dinner table, listening to my parents struggle to instruct me on how I should react if I became racially targeted in a post-pandemic world.  Growing up, conversations about race were never brought up in our household. I was born and raised in Diamond Bar, right on the border of Los Angeles County, which contains a dense Asian population of  54.5% . Ive grown comfortable with being surrounded by this demographic, and doing so allowed me the luxury of not needing to give much thought to being outed as a target for racism.  That is, until now.  Now, I watched my parents conduct a frustrating debate over exactly how worried we should be in regard to navigating the world after the pandemic ends. Now, I was watching as my parents considered purchasing a gun to feel more protected.  We were stuck in limbo; caught between the mild reassurance that we still live in a diverse and tolerant community, but also faced with the very valid fear that Asians have been and may continue to face increased instances of targeted racism, regardless of where we live and who were surrounded by.   ""Now, I was watching as my parents considered purchasing a gun to feel more protected."" I sensed that my father had enough of the speculation over such an uncertain future, indicated by the loud silence that now lingered in the air. It was as if we were waiting on something to confirm our worst fears or tell us to breathe a sigh of relief. What I hadnt expected were my fathers next words.  Ill always worry for your safety, especially after this, he said. In a firmer voice, he continued on: But I want to remind you. Try not to let a few encounters ruin your view on humanity as a whole. Its better to try living with an openness to the world rather than to constantly fear.  We are fortunate, my mother said. I dont want you to waste your time worrying too much. I am sure ... not everyone is irrational.  Whether my parents said this to simply pacify our shared concerns or if they truly meant what they said, I wasnt so sure. I wanted to believe my parents were going to regard this issue with the same courageous optimism theyve displayed all their lives, that they werent simply scrambling to yank the curtain back up and conceal any moments of weakness from me.  It will most likely be a while before I really have to think about re-entering a post-pandemic world as an Asian American. And despite the initial blow I felt from seeing my parents in a state of near-helplessness, Ive grown to only appreciate them more. Though they were dealing with an unpredictable future just as much as I was, they tried to maneuver the conversation toward optimism, determined to remember the good in the world.  For them, fighting to keep a positive outlook may be second nature.  For me, it was just   another reminder of their strength and resilience.

The future may appear bleak and uncertain as we cope with the effects of the coronavirus. However, there is hope for those mourning the temporary loss of their daily lives: Boredom in past quarantines has sparked some pretty amazing advancements in science and art that eventually inspired social change.  In the late 16th and into the 17th century, the recurring bubonic plague   impacted human society in a similar fashion to the current coronavirus pandemic, forcing people into quarantine and isolation for years when there   was no cure for the disease.   When theaters were forced to shut down in the early 1600s, Shakespeare took to isolation and wrote &#8220;King Lear&#8221; and &#8220;Hamlet,&#8221; among other famous works. In a form of escapism, he wrote   minimally about the plague, with only a handful of references to the disease. As a result, Shakespeare&#8217;s works gave his audience hope of a future where every hour would not be plagued by thoughts of the plague.   While productivity is by no means a requirement for safe quarantining, Newton spent his days exploring scientific theories in his bedroom during the Great Plague of London in the mid-1600s. His studies while doing the equivalent of social distancing eventually revolutionized math and physics for scholars around the world, including the law of universal gravitation.   [Related:  Scattered Bruins: International students from China explore new art forms while in isolation ]    Not only are there opportunities for creative exploration in times of quarantine, but there is also some room for reflection on what could benefit from ingenuity. The threat of disease inadvertently reveals social inequities that serve as a reminder of much-needed change.   Most notably, the  1918 Spanish flu pandemic  sparked a new awareness of public health and revolutionized sanitation systems,   especially in large cities with dense populations. This led to a broader understanding of why outbreaks occur and what people can do to combat them.   Anthropology professor Monica Smith said that while she hopes people will revert to being close to one another after the current pandemic is over, she anticipates a permanent shift in how people operate in their daily lives, especially in terms of hygiene. She   emphasized that we can rely on innovation to help us navigate pandemics.   &#8220;We recognize that there were many times in which something could have spilled over into a big pandemic and didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been really great with technology as a way of not only curing disease or addressing disease, but reducing our fears, which is wonderful.&#8221;  In addition,   Frank Snowden, a Yale University professor emeritus of history and the history of medicine, told  The New Yorker  that our collective response to a pandemic impacts how effectively we get through it.   &#8220;The main part of preparedness to face these events is that we need as human beings to realize that we&#8217;re all in this together, that what affects one person anywhere affects everyone everywhere,&#8221; Snowden said in the article.         Even as we quarantine ourselves, innovation is all around us.  Currently, nearly 100 alcohol distilleries are working to combat a shortage of hand sanitizer by repurposing their productions, and volunteers around the world are  sewing cloth masks  as we run out of surgical masks. Similarly, at UCLA, an electrical and computer engineering graduate student Glen Meyerowitz   has been working on  constructing cheaper ventilators  using parts he purchased from Home Depot, consulting experts along the way.   Thanks to the digital world, creating and sharing art in quarantine has never been simpler: fourth-year students Daniel Leka and Tobey Lee are adapting their art to internet platforms to reach their audiences.    [Related:  The Quad: Ways to stay connected, curb boredom during COVID-19 social distancing ]    Leka, a political science student, started an  auditory project  about the human experience and the midlife crisis that he had originally hoped to layer with in-person, interactive elements.   Leka said that despite having his final quarter of school taken away from him, he appreciates the extra time the circumstances have provided, allowing him to focus on the details of his project that feels more relevant than ever.   ""The main obstacle is that this project basically thrives off of human interaction,"" Leka said. ""I've told my other creative friends as well, but this time really entails more so flushing out your ideas and making sure that everything is intentional and has a reason behind it.""   Lee, a psychobiology and sociology student and co-founder of artist collective  CMMND , said he feels like now is the time for artists to try digital innovation and new ways of reaching people on live-streaming platforms.   ""If I were to give advice to people who are going to be in this situation in the future, or even right now: Don't let this event define you,"" Lee said.

Both NFL and NHL prospects can be drafted in one of seven rounds, and for the NBA, teams have two rounds to pick their newest rookie classes. But for MLB, teams select players from 40 rounds of drafting.  Clearly, one of these things is not like the others.  For a sport in which the majority of players find themselves in some type of major league affiliate farm team, professional baseball needs &#8211; and thrives on &#8211; the sheer volume of players it drafts from both high school and college.  But in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, MLB said in April it will cut the length of its draft from the typical 40 rounds to anywhere from five to 10 rounds. The draft&#8217;s shortening &#8211; while potentially saving millions for major league teams in signing bonuses &#8211; is set to bring negative consequences that manifest themselves most severely among collegiate baseball players.  The draft will inevitably have to be shortened, but MLB should mitigate the pressure on collegiate programs and their athletes by promising to do 10 rounds &#8211; the upper limit of its proposed reduction.  The shortening of the draft means that the vast majority of players who would have otherwise signed pro contracts will miss out on that opportunity in 2020. The top prospects will almost certainly be fine in a shortened draft, like UCLA baseball&#8217;s junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell, who was projected to be a top-10 selection by CBS Sports in April.  For the mid- to late-round prospects, however, the road to a professional contract won&#8217;t be so straight in 2020. For Bruins like junior right-handers Zach Pettway and Holden Powell, the 2020 season was their time to show scouts they were ready for pro ball.  There is always a risk of going undrafted for collegiate players who declare for the draft, but the 40 rounds of a typical draft give prospects a cushion and a sense of security.  [caption caption=""Three players from UCLA baseball &#8211; junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell and junior right handers Zach Pettyway and Holden Powell &#8211; were likely to try their hands at the 2020 MLB Draft following their junior campaigns. With the shortening of the draft, however, their plains remain uncertain. (Daily Bruin file photo)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_379763"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   Only 317 of the 1,217 players picked last year went in the first 10 rounds, meaning there are hundreds of ballplayers who might be forced to lay their careers on the line if their respective schools don't have room to welcome them back to their rosters.  The shortening of the MLB draft by close to 80% means that collegiate baseball players are going to be forced to make a near-impossible decision. But with the lengthening of the draft to its longest possible form, collegiate players have only a higher chance of being drafted.  Inevitably, though, a larger number of college baseball players are going back to school in the fall. With the shortened draft, not only will newly recruited freshmen join collegiate programs across the country, but veteran players &#8211; seniors in their fourth or fifth year &#8211; will be there as well.  Some top-tier high school seniors who would have considered skipping college for the minor leagues will probably go undrafted, and others might be more willing to honor their academic commitments even if they do get picked.   And while coaches will obviously have a lot of talent at their disposal for the 2021 season, the overcrowding of collegiate rosters means more competition for playing time and fights for roster spots and scholarships.  Amid the coronavirus cancellations that effectively put a pause on the sporting world, it seems that college baseball players got the short end of the stick. Not only was their season cut short, but summer leagues &#8211; like the Cape Cod and Northwoods leagues &#8211;  have had their seasons called off or postponed.  With the shortened MLB draft, scores of middle- and late-round talents are going to be denied their chance to go pro in 2020.  It&#8217;s just not fair.  MLB has the chance to relieve some pressure on collegiate baseball players by allowing for the most number of draftees it can in a shortened draft.  Because in a world in which so much is uncertain, with so much seemingly out of our control, MLB is in a unique position to take action. It controls the fate of hundreds of amateur players.  It&#8217;s MLB's responsibility to give ballplayers across the country a little normalcy &#8211; a feeling that&#8217;s recently been so elusive and hard to come by.

Mother Earth wants child support &#8211; literally.   In the latest episode of &#8220;Rick and Morty,&#8221; Rick sidetracks a family camping trip to visit his baby mama Gaia, a planet he has impregnated with innumerable, half-rock hominids. While a fringe group of rejected half-men rallies in the distance, Rick and his daughter Beth build an entire civilization in the time it takes for Morty and his sister Summer to get high off extraterrestrial brake fluid. But for the first time in the season, Rick's inexplicable godlike presence is presented as the butt of a cosmic joke rather than an all-powerful entity.  Within &#8220;Childrick of Mort,&#8221; Rick is a literal god by all standards of Greek mythology, foibles and all &#8211; and it works gloriously. Susceptible to the hubris-laden buffoonery expected of the most powerful deities, even Rick&#8217;s intellect may not be enough to assuage a raging side-planet.    [Related:    TV review: 7th &#8216;Rick and Morty&#8217; episode fails to build on borrowed sci-fi plots   ]   The episode opens with Rick's empty promises of &#8220;no sci-fi bullshit&#8221; as Jerry &#8211; the kids&#8217; father and Rick&#8217;s son-in-law &#8211; drives the family toward a camping ground. Unfortunately for Jerry, as it tends to be, they never reach their destination, as Rick realizes he has ostensibly impregnated an entire planet in a hornier version of Ursula K. Le Guin&#8217;s &#8220;Vaster Than Empires and More Slow.&#8221;   In the first family-centered episode of the new season, the Gaia conceit allows the show&#8217;s characters to explore how Rick&#8217;s insistent influence has shaped them, for better or for worse &#8211; but mostly worse.   As Gaia pumps out children from her volcano vagina, Rick is overcome with an uncharacteristic, fatherly impulse and decides to raise them with the help of Beth. As father and daughter create a factory to sort the half-men into productive categories, the brilliance of the setup is in its ambiguity &#8211; it is never certain if Rick&#8217;s altruism is genuine or merely birthed from a primal instinct to build cool, science-y stuff.   Meanwhile Beth, who has struggled with her dependence on Rick&#8217;s approval, seemingly receives it for the first time. However, his approval seems to be reliant on the extent to which Beth shapes herself in Rick&#8217;s image: Her incisive, cold intelligence is valued over her horse surgeon heart.   As the two build the factory, they siphon off the civilization&#8217;s &#8220;unproductives&#8221; &#8211; including DJs, foodies and influencers &#8211; into the backwoods of the planet.   Jerry, having been denigrated in a Rick-esque fashion by Summer, feels a sense of community with them and becomes their leader after introducing them to the divine concept of camping. While Beth attaches herself to her father&#8217;s acceptance, Jerry actively repudiates it in an attempt to escape the black-hole magnetism of his influence, exuding Rick-like behavior in hopes of feeling needed by his family.    [Related:    TV review: Layers of irony in &#8216;Never Ricking Morty&#8217; derail narration, criticize show&#8217;s fanbase ]    Meanwhile, the teenagers stumble into an abandoned alien spacecraft, where Summer microdoses on a glowing purple fluid using bong-like alien tech and Morty assumes the ship&#8217;s controls operate like a video game. Although hilarious, the premise of teenage ennui is a bit too predictable in a show that has succeeded in thinking outside of the Faraday box.   While Beth and Jerry&#8217;s interactions with sci-fi oddities are specific to Rick&#8217;s brand of weirdness and allow for meaningful episode-length arcs, Morty and Summer&#8217;s run-of-the-mill qualms with Jerry would be more at home in a season of &#8220;Parenthood.&#8221;   Speaking of paternity, a bombshell drops when it&#8217;s revealed Rick isn&#8217;t actually the father of Gaia&#8217;s children &#8211; it&#8217;s God. Waging a custody war with a sentient cloud, Rick launches himself into the heavens to battle a tatted, frat boy   Zeus. And for the first time, Rick loses, saved only by Morty and Summer accidentally flying their spacecraft through Zeus&#8217; brain. The teenagers, high out of their mind and traumatized by the consequences of their pettiness, beg for forgiveness as Rick celebrates their thoughtlessness for saving his life.   The setup works to a T because their grandfather&#8217;s success depends on Morty and Summer&#8217;s recklessness, echoing Beth&#8217;s relationship with him. Healthy habits, like timid steps toward maturity and self-accountability, aren&#8217;t conducive to helping Rick succeed.   After an angry Gaia banishes the family from herself for killing her true baby daddy, they fly away on Rick&#8217;s spacecraft as he tries to eschew responsibility by tattling on Summer and Morty  . This serves as a fitting end to an episode that crucifies Rick&#8217;s god complex rather than worships it.   And while God may &#8220;play the mysterious ways card,&#8221; Rick is all too easy to decipher.

No. 3 UCLA gymnastics (7-2, 5-2 Pac-12) defeated No. 9 California (4-4, 4-4) in Pauley Pavilion on Sunday. The Bruins posted their second-highest team score of the season and took first place on all four events in their final conference matchup of the year.  Today was another huge step for UCLA gymnastics, said coach Chris Waller. I could feel a weight be lifted off of everyones shoulders because we saw that we really have four great events.  UCLA opened the meet with a season-high 49.575 vault score  0.125 higher than its previous season's best  and beat California's vault score by a 0.575 margin.  The first rotation featured season highs for junior Nia Dennis and sophomore Sekai Wright, and career-best marks for junior Kendal Poston, senior Gracie Kramer and senior Kyla Ross  who scored her first perfect 10 on vault this season and her third overall perfect mark this year.  Based on how this year has been going, even when I land Im never really sure if its a 10, Ross said. That definitely felt like the best vault I could have done, and Ive been working a lot on vault this season, so I was thrilled.  The 10 was Ross 22nd career perfect score and the fifth perfect score recorded by a Bruin this season.  Two UCLA gymnasts  senior Madison Kocian and sophomore Margzetta Frazier  returned to the Bruins' uneven bars lineup for the first time in several weeks Sunday, and both contributed counting marks to UCLAs 49.450 event score.  Its huge to have (Frazier and Kocian) back, Waller said. (Fraziers) score potential is huge, and (Kocian) is at 100% of her potential given all of the years she has had surgery, and every opportunity they get to be out there is a gift.  Ross won the event with a 9.975  her 10th 9.975 this season on any event. One judge awarded her a 10, while the other gave her a 9.950, and Waller said he sided with the former.  I felt that (Ross bars routine) was a 10, Waller said. I didnt quite get a yellow card over it, but (the judge) had it prepared.  The Bruins, who rank No. 2 on uneven bars nationally, won the event for the first time in three weeks.  UCLA posted an event-winning 49.275 on balance beam  led by a 9.900 from sophomore Norah Flatley  and entered the final rotation ahead by 0.725.  All five of the Bruins counting floor exercise routines scored 9.850 or higher, including event-winning 9.950s for Dennis and senior Felicia Hano.  UCLAs 49.600 on floor was its fourth-highest score on the event this year, though only two other teams in the nation have managed to pass the 49.600 threshold on floor this season.  Ross won the all-around with a 39.725, while Hano posted a 39.450 all-around score  her career-high  for the second week in a row.  Hano said that she was feeling sick before Sundays meet but still opted to compete.  I wasnt feeling well, but warmups went well anyway, Hano said. Whenever my team needs that boost, I want to be there for them. Its cool that I can keep doing well every week and still have room to improve.

UCLA baseball&#8217;s Garrett Mitchell will likely enter the 2020 MLB Draft in June as a consensus top-25 prospect. The junior center fielder is looking to follow in the footsteps of one of his former teammates, first baseman Michael Toglia, who was selected 23rd overall by the Colorado Rockies in the first round of the 2019 draft.  In the shortened 2020 season, Mitchell started and batted leadoff in all 15 of the Bruins&#8217; games. He was third on the team in both on-base and slugging percentage &#8211; posting figures of .425 and .484, respectively &#8211; and led UCLA in doubles and stolen bases.  A top prospect out of Orange Lutheran High School, Mitchell fell to the 14th round in the 2017 MLB Draft because of contract demands, despite his strong reputation as a five-tool player. He is currently ranked sixth on the MLB.com Top Draft Prospects List, and has been slotted to go as high as sixth to as low as 21st overall in notable mock drafts.   Coach John Savage has routinely praised Mitchell for being a well-rounded, five-tool player, something that could set him up for an intriguing professional career. Mitchell is considered the best player in the second tier of prospects, and the combination of his elite speed, ability to hit to all fields and play solid defense will likely lead to his name being called early on June 10.   Speed   On the 20-80 scale used to grade baseball prospects, Mitchell earned a 70 in the Run category from MLB.com, and is one of only two players in the top 20 who has been graded better than 55. Mitchell has shown off his speed as a Bruin, stealing 28 bags in the blue and gold, including 18 a year ago, which was good for fourth in the Pac-12.  Of all of his tools, speed is his most consistent and adaptable to the pros. It isn't too often that a 6-foot-3, 215-pound outfielder can lead the nation in triples, but Mitchell did just that in 2019 with 12 three-baggers.    Defense   Mitchell also uses his plus-speed in the outfield, roaming the alleyways at Jackie Robinson Stadium and receiving consistent acclaim from Savage about his range. He only earned a 50 for his Field rating from MLB, but he projects as an above-average defense center fielder at the next level.  A big part of Mitchell&#8217;s defensive game is the strength of his arm, for which he earned a 60 rating &#8211; the best among nonpitcher and noncatcher prospects in the top 50.  The combination of his speed and his throwing ability make Mitchell a highly projectable everyday center fielder at the big league level, and his extensive experience in right field doesn't hurt either. He made only three errors in his time in Westwood and collected two outfield assists as well.  However, being an above-average defender in center field requires the ability to stay healthy, and because of potential concerns surrounding his Type 1 diabetes, The Athletic&#8217;s Keith Law has Mitchell falling out of the top 20.   Hitting   Perhaps his best tool outside of his speed is his bat, for which he earned another 60    from MLB.com. Mitchell hit well over .300 in his sophomore and junior seasons and will leave UCLA with a career .327 mark. In his three years, Mitchell has shown an ability to have gap-to-gap power, notching 24 doubles, 15 triples and six home runs.  Mitchell has the ability to work opposing pitchers, forcing them to throw him strikes to get him out &#8211; a skill he put to good work in 2020. This season, Mitchell displayed his keen eye, as he earned six free passes plus two intentional walks in 75 plate appearances.  Throughout his UCLA career, Mitchell considerably cut down his strikeout numbers, while raising his walk rates. In his freshman season, he played in 44 games and struck out in 22.6% of his plate appearances, while only walking in 6.2%.  A year later, the then-sophomore struck out in a much more respectable 13.9% of his plate appearances and bumped his walk rate up to 9.8%. In the small sample size that is the 2020 campaign, Mitchell only struck out three times, or 4.0% of his trips to the plate and walked 10.7% of the time.  With the increasing prevalence of strikeouts in today&#8217;s game, his ability to improve his approach and swing at fewer bad pitches as he gained experience is surely a hopeful sign for his success facing better competition in professional ball.   Power   Mitchell only homered once every 79.5 at-bats as a Bruin, but he does have raw power in his repertoire.   Despite hitting zero round-trippers in the first 15 games of 2020, most scouts are confident the power he shows off in batting practice &#8211; and the power he displayed in high school &#8211; will be able to translate in the lower levels of professional baseball, and eventually up to the majors. This should be encouraging for Mitchell, who only earned a 50 grade for his power, as teams will be able to look past his modest power numbers in college ball, believing that he can develop into a more feared hitter.   Player Comparisons: Jason Heyward, A.J. Pollock   When Jason Heyward broke into the MLB with the Atlanta Braves in 2010 and homered in his first career at-bat, it looked as though he might have a storied career ahead of him. While the now-Chicago Cubs outfielder never became the perennial All-Star people expected him to be, he has turned his tools and size into some solid seasons and big-time contracts, and Mitchell has a lot in common with him.  Mitchell is 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds. Heyward stands at 6-foot-5 and weighs 240 pounds. Two inches and 25 pounds &#8211; some of which will inevitably be made up when Mitchell reaches a big league training routine &#8211; is not a vast difference, especially because of the similarities in their game.  In his four best seasons by fWAR, Heyward played in an average of 150.75 games, hitting 17.25 home runs, stealing 18.75 bases and saving 19.25 runs on defense. The almost 20 defensive runs saved is elite and probably a stretch for Mitchell, but he could conceivably find himself in the 20-20 club, while also offering plus-defense.  For Heyward, the problem has been staying consistent and healthy. If Mitchell is able to crack the league and get consistent playing time, he should be able to put together campaigns similar to the prime years of Heyward &#8211; a former mid-first-round pick.  Similarly to Heyward, Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder A.J. Pollock has had a couple impressive seasons sprinkled into his otherwise slightly above average career. The 6-foot-1, 212 pound, former mid-first-round pick out of Notre Dame put together his best season in 2015 when he hit 20 long balls, stole 39 bags and tallied 10 defensive runs saved as the Arizona Diamondbacks' everyday center fielder.  In the seasons since, Pollock has not been able to replicate his production from that 6.8 fWAR year &#8211; in part due to injury &#8211; but has still been a serviceable outfielder. Even if Mitchell can&#8217;t meet his ceiling of being a consistent 20-20 player with occasional All-Star appearances, he should be a solid everyday outfielder, or great fourth outfielder, coming off the bench to pinch hit, run or play defense.  Mitchell possesses above-average skills in all five tools &#8211; hitting, hitting for power, running, fielding and throwing. Even though he wasn't able to complete his important junior season and let scouts see him and his team in his collegiate prime, Mitchell is likely to be off the board early in the shortened MLB Draft.

Closer to home, UCLA isn&#8217;t doing much more than the bare minimum &#8211; especially when it comes to protecting its essential workers.  After a UCLA Facilities Management employee the  died  of  COVID-19, the Teamsters Local 2010 union, which represents employees working in higher education institutions,  reiterated  their demand that the state and employers provide more paid sick leave and personal protective equipment to essential workers. A Teamsters Local 2010 representative also claimed that UCLA Health has not been consistently providing PPE or mask-fitting tests.  But instead of addressing the problem during what is coming up on two months of lockdown, the university is busy  requiring  daily symptom surveys and sending out vaguely reassuring emails.  UCLA has a crisis on its hands but so do the employees who keep the ship running. As a bastion of research and progress, the university must provide its essential employees with consistent PPE, mask-fittings and hazard pay as suggested by Teamsters Local 2010 and employees across the country. Paid sick leave policies and symptom monitoring are a good start, but UCLA has a long way to go until its employees are given the provisions or pay they deserve given the risk factors.  And until it does, the university is distracting itself from the underlying problem.  On March 16, University of California President Janet Napolitano issued an  executive order  stipulating that 128 hours &#8211; over two weeks &#8211; of paid sick leave would be granted to all employees who were experiencing symptoms or knew someone who was experiencing symptoms of COVID-19.  Although it&#8217;s not ideal, the sick leave policy itself is rather generous compared to other institutions'. But if UCLA&#8217;s employees can&#8217;t access proper protective equipment, sick leave will only provide a respite when the inevitable occurs.  A commitment to the health of essential workers is perhaps the single most important moral imperative right now, and it&#8217;s one that would serve UCLA in the coming months as well.  Currently, the CDC  does not know  the period of infectiousness for COVID-19. But with an incubation period of up to 14 days, it seems overwhelmingly safe to say that those employees left unprotected by the university will have an astronomically higher risk of exposure.  Put simply, the university must commit to providing its workers with the basic necessities to get this job done. Unions, students and  petitions  have let them know what they need to do &#8211; now they need to make it happen.  Of course, fighting this pandemic is no easy task &#8211; and UCLA is going to have to make some unpopular calls in the coming months. But failing to provide protections for its essential workers can&#8217;t be one of them. Implementing symptom screening surveys is great, but when employees don&#8217;t have protection once they actually get to work, UCLA&#8217;s only addressed a fraction of the problem.  Now, they need to address the rest of it. ",[],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/edi-2.png

The Westwood Village Improvement Association unanimously asked LA City Planning to remove some food establishment and parking regulations in the Westwood Village Specific Plan, a zoning and regulatory framework for the area, during a virtual board  meeting  Thursday.  The changes have long been anticipated by some Westwood stakeholders who blame provisions in the Specific Plan for the high business vacancy rates in the Village. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Village had a vacancy rate around 20%. With the permanent closure of several businesses, such as  Stan&#8217;s Donuts , during the stay-at-home order, the rate may well have risen.   The board&#8217;s recommendations were made with a heightened concern for the economic outlook of the Village amid the coronavirus pandemic. Board chair Kevin Crummy said he thinks current circumstances call for a regulatory environment with minimal obstacles for new businesses.  &#8220;These are absolutely necessary positions for survival in the Village,&#8221; Crummy said. &#8220;If we ever want to come back, we're going to need to put an 'open for business' sign and make it as easy as possible for people to open businesses.&#8221;  The board met with Zuriel Espinosa, an LA City Planning associate, to go over possible amendments to the Specific Plan as part of the outreach phase of the amendment process. Espinosa previously met with the North Westwood Neighborhood Council which endorsed similar amendments  March 4.   Espinosa said LA City Planning began considering amending the Specific Plan following the approval of a Los Angeles City Council  motion  from November 2018. The Specific Plan, which was adopted in 1989, aims to create a balanced mix of business, preserve historic architecture and encourage automobile access to the Village, Espinosa added.  The board first considered the issue of restaurant and fast food establishment definitions, which draw a distinction between the two types of restaurants. They unanimously recommended these definitions be eliminated to enable a variety of food establishments, including more contemporary hybrid restaurants, to set up in the Village without being forced to adhere to imprecise standards.  Board member Peter Clinco, owner of Skylight Gardens, said he does not think it would be useful to distinguish between fast food establishments and restaurants because the pandemic is forcing fine dining establishments to take on fast food characteristics.  &#8220;The lines with the COVID-19 issue are going to get blurred as to what constitutes fast food because things may change even in the fine dining business,&#8221; Clinco said. &#8220;I'm thinking, the best thing we can do is relax or eliminate any requirements for the foreseeable (because) the future is not going to be the way it was before.&#8221;  The board also called for the removal of food use ratios &#8211; restrictions on the number of different food establishments per street.  Additionally, the board recommended LA City Planning apply general citywide parking requirements to the Village rather than keep the stricter requirements of the Specific Plan. This would include the elimination of Specific Plan parking requirements for hotels, motion pictures, nightclubs and offices. Furthermore, the board asked for the removal of parking requirements that occur when a location changes from one type of business to another.  The board also recommended LA City Planning allow businesses to lease parking spaces rather than enter into long-term covenant agreements with landlords that can be enforced even when property ownership is transferred. Lastly, it asked LA City Planning to increase the allowable distance for off-site parking options from 1,000 feet to 1,320 feet.  Board member Dean Abell, vice president of Sarah Leonard Fine Jewelers, said he supported the elimination of parking requirements because he thinks it's too costly to build parking in the Village and secure covenant agreements.  &#8220;I've been advocating for at least the last five years now that parking restrictions are pretty ridiculous,&#8221; Abell said. &#8220;These businesses don't have the ability to create parking spaces in Westwood. ... I would love to have dedicated parking for my store, but it's not possible. ... We've been there for 50 years with one parking space.&#8221;  Abell also voiced his support for the elimination of fast food establishment and restaurant restrictions as well. He said he would welcome whatever food establishment that may draw customers to his retail business.  &#8220;If food is what's bringing people close to my store, I'll take it,&#8221; Abell said. ""And that was (true) even before COVID-19 but especially post. We gotta make it as welcoming and easy for any businesses that want to fill our storefronts, so we don't turn into a ghost town.&#8221; ",['cap-martin-bilbao'],"['los-angeles', 'news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/news.wvia_.al_.jpg

At UCLA, our community is remarkably united by similar feelings of loss, confusion and concern, but also by light, hope and perspective that the pandemic has brought to the forefront. In Columns From Quarantine, Daily Bruin staffers and community submissions highlight the personal stories that mark this unprecedented moment.

I speed walk the most efficient routes to class. I wake up early. I set alarms to make sure Im perfectly on time to everything. My roommates say I have fast, hard energy.  I like it that way. When the little things are in order, I can concentrate on the big things. I stay oriented.  The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying lockdown have not disorganized the little things. For me, it obliterated them.  Even so, as the newly elected editor in chief of the Daily Bruin, its my job to help us chronicle history. That holds, even if my piece in this is a tiny blip of history and one I happen not to like.  So lets back up a bit.  The Daily Bruin editor in chief selection process is insanely long. Theres 50-something hours of interviews, a small novel of an application, a three-hour exam and an hour-long Q&amp;A in front of 200 people.  Given the fact that this is an unholy amount of work in the midst of late winter quarter, time management is key. In late February and early March, I felt up for it. I dug into the interviews and starting ticking off to-do boxes, The New York Times The Daily podcast at double speed in the background. As the days went on, those podcasts were more and more frequently about the coronavirus.  Im sure you can guess where this goes next. On March 12, I turned 21 years old. On March 13, UCLA closed through the end of the academic year.  On, off. Like a faucet.  Well, I thought, alone in my childhood bedroom on my 21st birthday. I have no right to be upset.  My professors were all very reasonable about easing up on finals. Im not a senior, denied one last quarter at UCLA and a meaningful commencement. My parents still have their jobs. My loved ones are relatively healthy.  I am very lucky. I shouldnt allow myself to be upset.  Besides, I reasoned, now I have more time to work on my application.  So I pulled up a million tabs on my laptop and sat down at my desk to write. The words, usually slippery but within reach, eluded me.  Maybe it was the lighting. I moved to the couch. The dining room table. The backyard. I pulled a full ""Green Eggs and Ham"": house, box, car, tree. You name it, I probably tried it. The cycle took more days than Id care to admit.  My podcasts gradually lost their appeal. Politics, science, history. What did the future or the past matter to me now, when the present world was crashing down?  I did nothing. I did less than nothing, in fact, deciding to cut down what Id already written. It was a stupid love letter to a version of reality that no longer existed.  The realization came quietly, at two times speed.  Every morning, I still devoured the news podcasts. I wanted to know everything, to acknowledge the incredible highs and lows that people are dealing with on a daily basis. Meandering through my house, in fuzzy socks for too many days in a row, I felt an overwhelming obligation to bear witness.  It then occurred to me that I was being an idiot. Here I was, wishing there was something I could do, when the application was right there in front of me.  I work for a newspaper. I was running to be editor in chief of a newspaper. Bearing witness is what we do every single day.  Theres honestly not much else I can tell you about the work between that moment and now. Once the feeling of purpose came back, the challenges faded to static.  The Daily Bruin is doing crucial work.  Our newspaper is just one small tile in a mosaic of narratives captured throughout this pandemic. Its imperfect, like all things, but not for a lack of trying.  Im undeterred. Our job is crucial nonetheless, and heres why: If we do not preserve this moment in UCLAs history, no one will.  The larger history will be saved, definitely. But the modest, close history of our students, professors and staff falls to the Daily Bruin.  That job is complicated by the circumstances. Our print product, and the revenue that comes with it, has vanished indefinitely. Our team is scattered across continents and timezones.  Its going to be difficult, but we have a responsibility to carry the stories of even greater difficulties forward. And a global pandemic is not going to get in our way.

The Ucla4Cola movement has been asking for that mile for months .  But between abysmal communication, poorly allocated funds and complete avoidance of  housing insecurity complaints, UCLA has done little to alleviate the rent burden many graduate students face &#8211; something that has become all the more frustrating given the extra hardships imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The university announced a summer fellowship on March 10 that will offer students   a need-based stipend of  $2,500  a month for three months to support research and other work.   The funds for the fellowship were taken in part from the Centennial Campaign, which raised  $414 million  for graduate student fellowships, as well as other institutional funds.  The announcement came after graduate students voted to go on  strike  regardless of support from United Auto Workers Local 2865, the union that represents academic student workers, pending support from at least 10 departments. Though the demonstrations were ultimately  delayed  because of the campus shutdown, the demand for a cost of living adjustment remains potent for many students.  This fellowship may be a step in the right direction, but it&#8217;s not a resource that will be available to all graduate students &#8211;   meaning many will still be left without the funds they need.   In addition, the university is failing to communicate with its student body, leaving members of the Graduate Students Association feeling they have been misled or lied to about how Centennial Campaign funds can be spent.  What students need is a housing stipend that can guarantee the funds necessary to live in one of the country&#8217;s most expensive neighborhoods. More than that, they need   a university that is capable of having straightforward conversations about student needs, which have become even more important amid the preexisting   financial   insecurities now aggravated by a pandemic.  For many students, not only is the fellowship inadequate &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t even address the issue.   &#8220;I think that (the stipend) sort of avoids the problem,&#8221; said Cooper Lynn, a graduate student in the Department of Slavic, East European and Eurasian Languages and Cultures. &#8220;It does seem to sort of sidestep what we're asking for, which is a cost of living adjustment.""  The stipend is simply too limited to be an effective support and consistent security net for graduate students. What they need is a more permanent solution to the financial hardships they face.   And while the summer stipend might help keep them afloat for a few months, it does little in the long run to help students.  Providing basic needs is even more urgent with the campus shut down and an economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in an estimated  7.1 million unemployed , according to the US Department of Labor. For those students who have lost secondary jobs or whose family economic situations have suffered, these stipends are a drop in the bucket.  The university claims one of the difficulties in providing graduate students with something like a housing stipend is that the Centennial Campaign, from which the summer fellowship was partially withdrawn,   is fairly inflexible.   &#8220;The majority of the gifts to the campaign, including the funds raised for student financial support, are designated for specific purposes, and the university cannot redirect that money to other areas or programs,&#8221; said   UCLA spokesperson   Ricardo Vazquez in an emailed statement.  For this same reason, UCLA is forced to look elsewhere for funds to support graduate students who might be facing financial hardships during campus shutdown. Vazquez said the university is working on raising funds from donors, the Spark campaign and the state to help students most affected by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, the limited nature of UCLA&#8217;s control over the Centennial Campaign's fund is called into question by the fact that the summer fellowship is funded by the Centennial Campaign at all.   &#8220;I had a meeting in January where ... (the administration) is telling me they can&#8217;t use the Centennial funds for housing subsidies,&#8221; said Zak Fisher, president of the GSA. &#8220;And now all of a sudden ... that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened.&#8221;  Granted, the fellowship isn&#8217;t a housing subsidy in the sense that the Ucla4Cola movement is advocating for, but Fisher said the university told him and the GSA that they couldn&#8217;t use funds from the Centennial Campaign to support graduate students .       A month later, they did just that.  Regardless of the actual control UCLA has over the Centennial Campaign's funds, it&#8217;s troubling that students feel deceived by administration, even as the university continuously asserts its commitment to open, honest discussion with its grad students.  To be fair, the Centennial Campaign raised an impressive $414 million in graduate student fellowship support, but this money will go toward things like the summer fellowship UCLA announced in March.   What students really need is a long-term stipend that can explicitly support them in areas such as housing.   And even if UCLA is to be believed, the inflexibility of the Centennial Campaign's fund means that students likely won&#8217;t receive   much support for hardships faced as a result of COVID-19 &#8211; severely reducing the fund&#8217;s usefulness.  Passionate leadership and growing support have ensured that Ucla4Cola&#8217;s message is far-reaching, even during this difficult time.  Let&#8217;s just hope UCLA listens.

With global stay-at-home guidelines in effect due to the coronavirus pandemic, musicians have been forced to either cancel or postpone their upcoming tours to a later date. But using digital platforms such as YouTube, Instagram and Twitch, artists of all genres are attempting to replicate the concert experience for a greater online audience. These live-streamed sets and interactive experiences not only add to a breadth of free content available to fans for the foreseeable future, but also promote much-needed messages of inclusivity and togetherness at a time of isolation.  Lifting the spirits of his audience,   YUNGBLUD is one of many artists who have put out free live-streamed content in the wake of the cancellation of his   ""The Underrated Youth Tour."" His hour-long YouTube Live special on March 16 entitled ""THE YUNGBLUD SHOW LIVE"" featured a talk show-like set-up with interjections of quick comedy bits and even a cooking segment between his musical performances.   [Related:    Music Preview: Rising artists span genres and embrace lyrical depth in recent releases   ]   With an incredibly high production value  due in part to the camera crew and band behind him  YUNGBLUD aimed to emulate the vibrant   energy of   his in-person shows. At times, he even prompted the audience to put their hands in the air or expected them to finish his lyrics, pointing his microphone at the camera.  However, YUNGBLUD wasn't the only artist making the most of their quarantine to ensure their fans stay entertained. On Friday, singer Tinashe hosted a free dance class streamed on Instagram Live, where she taught her own choreography. On top of that, Diplo   has continued to host his own virtual concert series, entitled Corona World Tour every Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, where he DJs and remixes songs with other musicians.  With some artists opting for special guests or   interactive segments, they are truly taking advantage of the freedom they gain in having complete control of an online streamed concert. And while these performances are not exact replicas of a live show, the individual and personal aspects of each concert still allows listeners to be close to their favorites and feel a little less distant from them.  The mass wave of live-streaming experiences also works to emphasize an overall feeling of togetherness between listeners and musicians alike. In an industry that can often seem divided because of the media narratives of feuding artists and intense competition, it is humbling to see an entire community of artists unite to support each other. These entirely free makeshift live performances signal how much artists appreciate their fan base.   [Related:    Album review: All Time Low honors its past, delves into more mature themes in Wake Up, Sunshine   ]     Taking that a step further, iHeartRadio   hosted a televised benefit concert, featuring artists such as Billie Eilish, Alicia Keys and Elton John. The show was broadcasted internationally on TV and later posted onto YouTube, raising money for Feeding America and the First Responder's Children's foundation. The show also allowed artists to connect with and encourage audiences across genres to remain positive long after their live performances.  And the possible lasting effects these virtual shows could have on the music industry are endless. Online streaming gives artists the opportunity to reach a much wider demographic than previously possible through ticketed live shows. They are now able to share their stage presence   with those who might be   geographically or financially excluded from attending live events otherwise. With a computer and a stable source of Wifi, artists are able to tap into a new demographic, giving an online concert the potential of setting a new standard for the music industry.  Digital streaming is not only being used by larger artists, but it is helping lesser-known artists stay afloat as well. For those who are reliant on touring and performing in order to pay for food and necessities, low-stakes live concerts prove to be an opportunity to gain exposure and share an artist's beliefs with the world.  It is strikingly clear that an online concert cannot seamlessly replace the experience of actually going to see an artist perform live, and fans and music-lovers shouldnt expect it to. But in the midst of a global pandemic, luxuries such as concerts and music festivals must be put to the side. However, the exploration of this innovative and unprecedented new medium of digital concerts gives a glimpse of what the future of performance could look like.  Serving to both brighten fans days and keep artists afloat during troubling times, online concerts provide unforeseen benefits to music fans and may very well be the future of the music industry.",['cap-natalie-brown'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/onlineconcerts_CMYK.jpg

Following his first serious breakup, Anand said he used the method to start and finish a song recounting the experience in a single night. It was that one session that led to an infatuation with the hyper-focused way of songwriting, he said.  &#8220;I kind of just wrote the full song at three AM, and after that it was addicting,&#8221;   Anand said. &#8220;(Being able to write an original song) was amazing; being able to write a song and call it my own and to put my experiences in it and share it with people.&#8221;   [Related:    Headliners: Michael Palermo strums his way into the music industry with a ukulele   ]   Part of his process to solidify a functional songwriting technique included finding a subject matter worth dedicating a track to, he said. Storytelling proved to be the aspect that drove the singer&#8217;s most fruitful sessions, as he said it gave his lyrics a sense of direction. Aside from his first song about his breakup, Anand said he has written lyrics to describe notable occurrences going on around him &#8211;   like the birth of his nephew and navigating the dating world. The themes he explores may not always reference exact experiences, but he said he takes emotional inspiration from the events for the final product.  &#8220;The easiest way for me to song write has been making it into a musical story for people to understand,&#8221; Anand said. &#8220;It can be very difficult to keep that going with new music as well, because if I don't have a story, then it's kind of like, &#8216;What am I writing about?&#8217;&#8221;  [embed url=""https://youtu.be/JGf0eOeIB-k"" contenteditable=""false"" uuid=""9e45bf8f862c4d7d8248a7941f4dd9ca"" provider=""YouTube""]https://youtu.be/JGf0eOeIB-k[/embed]   Sometimes portions of conversations   &#8211; in tone or sentiment &#8211; find their way into Anand&#8217;s songs as he searches for topics noteworthy enough for a midnight songwriting session. Soham Gupta, a third-year civil engineering student, said he lives with Anand and often finds feelings from conversations he had with him expressed later   in song.   Anand&#8217;s songs come across as emotionally genuine because of their roots in these real-life occurrences, Gupta said. Overall, each track shows his softer, more caring side, which he said aids Anand&#8217;s efforts to properly reflect his emotional reactions toward the situations covered in his lyrics. While there is a level of raw honesty in the music that clearly resonates   with Anand's personality, it's his voice which makes him comparable to other indie-pop artists who use similar soft vocals and stripped back guitar, Gupta said.   &#8220;The way he talks sounds nothing like the way he sings,&#8221; Gupta said. &#8220;The first time I heard him sing I was like, 'That sounds like Ed Sheeran.'""  Outside of vocal ability, Anand&#8217;s confident live presence is also full of surprises, said Michaela Capps, a third-year international development studies and neuroscience student. She said when Anand was hired to perform at her fundraiser event, he was initially hesitant to play alongside seasoned student musicians. But once he took the stage, he showcased his upbeat personality   as he told the audience stories between comfortably strumming songs on   his guitar, she said.  &#8220;It was insane to ... see him take root and put his creativity out there and seem really confident even though he was talking before about how nervous he was,&#8221; Capps said.   [Related:    Student learns lessons of competition in process of auditioning for &#8216;American Idol&#8217;   ]   Maya Partha, a third-year economics and international development studies student, said part of Anand&#8217;s stage confidence stems from his assurance that his audiences can relate to the stories he tells in his songs. Anand has become comfortable writing about universal topics like romance and breakups, she said, which makes his music well-suited for all audiences.  As he's grown as a lyricist, the singer has also gained the ability to quickly write last-minute songs  , she said. Anand and Partha occasionally perform together, and she said on the day of one of their shows, he brought a song he wrote the night before to showcase for the crowd. And while Anand said he is still new to the music scene, his willingness to experiment with string-picking patterns and tempo makes him excited to perform his one-session songs live.  He said the unorthodox method of writing is sometimes a process of trial and error since it doesn&#8217;t always result in a song he is satisfied with. But ever since he   wrote his first song in one night in a Hedrick Hall South stairwell, Anand said hasn't looked back.    &#8220;I need to sit down and just write it all at once, or I'm not going to be able to finish it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I guess I'm still developing as a songwriter in that sense.

It didnt matter that No. 10 UCLA womens basketball (26-5, 14-4 Pac-12) began its season with its best start in program history, was the last remaining undefeated team in the nation or was projected by some to secure its highest NCAA tournament seed in program history.  It all happened so fast, said junior forward Michaela Onyenwere. We knew the (NCAA) tournament might get canceled, so we were all kind of preparing for it, but I think when it actually happened, no one was really prepared.  In a matter of days, concerns about the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus prompted UCLA Athletics, the NCAA and other sports governing bodies to bar fans from games and ultimately cancel seasons outright. UCLA women's basketball was no exception, and the Bruins' record-breaking season wasn't allowed to carry on through March Madness.  But it wasnt the first time UCLA had dealt with external hardship this year, and coach Cori Close said she knew her players would get through it, just as they had all season  by   loving each other even when they were out of the spotlight.  There are so many unprecedented things that they accomplished, Close said. (But) Im most proud of the way that they persevered, the way that they showed up for each other and the way that they loved each other in the dark. What I mean by in the dark is no TV cameras, no one knows the stuff thats going on, and theyre just doing the right thing for each other.  While outwardly the 2019-2020 season was a historic one for the Bruins since the beginning, the private team dynamic was also something unprecedented, according to Close.  The coach said the cancellation of March Madness was yet another obstacle in the off-the-court battles her athletes faced over the course of the season.  This was one of the most burdened teams I have ever coached, Close said. A whole lot of life stuff happened to individual players this year ... and its mostly all the off-court stuff of just life, of just being a human being and difficult circumstances.  After delivering the news that the team's season was over in the team locker room March 12, the coach said she posed one question to her players: For how many of you has this been the hardest year of your life?  All around, hands went up. One of those hands belonged to Japreece Dean.  [caption id=""attachment_377472"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Redshirt senior guard Japreece Dean was named to the 2019-2020 All Pac-12 team after she averaged 5.5 assists in 33.8 minutes per game for No. 10 UCLA women's basketball.

Dean started her college career at Texas Tech, where she led all Big-12 freshmen in points per game, assist-to-turnover ratio and free throw percentage. She played just two games as a Lady Raider her sophomore season before redshirting and transferring to UCLA.   [Related:    Womens basketball guard Japreece Dean transferred to UCLA in search of victory   ]   After starting just one game during her first season in Westwood, Dean has now cemented herself as the Bruins' starting point guard, earning Pac-12 All-Tournament Team honors last season and being named to the All Pac-12 team this year.  Despite everything, Dean said the previous season has been her most challenging since starting NCAA basketball nearly five years ago.  This season was probably the hardest season (of my college career), I think anybody would probably say that, Dean said. We were winning, but it just felt weird ... it was just kind of hard with everything going on.  And having it end like this, Dean said, was perhaps the hardest part.  Close said Dean couldnt look her in the eye and tell the coach she was alright after hearing news of the NCAA tournament cancellation. Just moments later, the Bruins took to the floor in what would be their last practice of the year and quite possibly Deans last in blue and gold.  When Dean went on to have one of her best practices of the season, Close said it was a reminder of the fifth-years greatest gift to the program  her love of competing.  Close recalled the pre-Dean era and said she had to constantly check in with her players to make sure they were putting in work outside of practice, hoping silently they all showed up to voluntary pick-up games.  But for the last three seasons, Close said those worries were gone, knowing Dean  and her passion for playing basketball  was pushing not only herself but also the rest of the teammates to put in extra work.  (Dean) just loves the game so much, and she changed our whole culture with her love of the game, Close said. Her love was so infectious that things got done. ... She got everyone (to pick-up), and she never had to tell me about it. It was just like, This is what we do if were going to be about pursuing championships: Youre going to show up to pick-up, youre going to do the extra work.  Now, Dean is back at home in Austin, Texas, facing an entirely new set of unknowns without her teammates by her side, without the lights of Pauley Pavilion shining down on her  very much in the dark.  Dean said she has yet to decide whether she will take an extra year in Westwood, if it is offered, or declare for the WNBA draft  if there even is one this spring. For the time being, she said she feels grateful for her years spent in Westwood, even the most recent one.  These three years are probably three of the greatest years of my life, although one of them is probably the worst year of my life, Dean said. It has taught me a lot, and Ive met incredible people, and I think Ive just had a bunch of fun.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has caused shortages of PPE for health care professionals across the nation, leaving medical workers without the necessary protection or having to  reuse PPE .  3D4E, a 3D printing organization at UCLA, is training participating members how to produce PPE using 3D printers, said Ryan Tong, the tech advisor of 3D4E and a second-year computer engineering student at UCLA.  The group is working to produce the equipment with AIRES, or the AI Robotics Ethics Society, a nonprofit organization formed at UCLA for the purpose of discussing and disseminating information about the ethics of artificial intelligence. The project receives funding support from a  GoFundMe  page started by AIRES at the beginning of April.  AIRES started the GoFundMe page with the goal to raise $15,000 in order to create at least 10,000 face shields, said Aaron Hui, the president of AIRES and a fourth-year computational and systems biology student at UCLA. AIRES and 3D4E will use the funds to buy 3D printers and other necessary materials to assemble the PPE.  Although the initiative doesn&#8217;t concern AI ethics, Hui said the group still wanted to help.  &#8220;When we realized that there's a shortage of PPE materials, we really wanted to make a difference,&#8221; Hui said. &#8220;While we didn't really have that much experience in this area, we knew that we had the infrastructure and we also have the connections to make this possible.&#8221;  The group has chapters at UCLA, USC, Cornell, Caltech, Stanford and Brown University, and are using their network to make their new endeavor possible, Hui added.  The GoFundMe has raised more than $4,300 so far, which the team is using to produce hundreds of face shields for hospitals, Hui said. When there is no longer a need to print PPE, the 3D printers will be donated to their respective universities.  Though the members of AIRES and 3D4E are assembling the face shields separately, they are constantly communicating with each other to solve any problems that might occur, Tong said.  &#8220;3D4E has been kind of doing more of the technical things, helping out those who have never touched 3D printers before with support or advice, and we've been recommending what kind of filament to use and just some of the material logistics.&#8221;  The face shields are made using the Swedish 3DVerkstan model, which is a National Institutes of Health-approved design for the 3D-printed headband. The members are also using Fused Deposition Modeling 3D printers along with PETG filaments, material that is both durable and flexible, to print the plastic headband. PVC binding covers and a three-hole puncher are then used to attach the plastic sheet to the headband to create the shield, Hui said.   The members are taking extra precautions when assembling the shields, wearing their own masks and gloves, Hui said. Once the face shields have been made they are left alone for three days to disinfect and are then delivered to local hospitals personally or by mail, he added.  Respirators and N95 masks, which filter around 95% of airborne particles, are a more effective form of protection, but 3D printed face masks do not ensure the N95 quality that hospitals typically require, Hui said.   &#8220;We're 3D printing what we can, which is face shields, and it's still an extremely vital piece of equipment. Respirators and N95 masks, while they are extremely important, they're just part of the protection &#8211; the whole face has to be protected, not just the nose or the mouth,&#8221; Hui said.  Leila Kim, president of AIRES at Brown University and a second-year computer science student, has never used a 3D printer before but believes the process won&#8217;t be too difficult.  &#8220;If we need help we can contact (3D4E) and they've been very helpful with providing files and giving tips about ... printing the most quickly,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;I was a little intimidated by having to learn how to 3D print but it actually seems like I'm in good hands.&#8221;  Though 3D printing is outside of AIRES&#8217;s area of interest, Hui said the group was reminded why they got involved with AI ethics amid this pandemic.  &#8220;We couldn't foresee (COVID-19), but it's already threatening our loved ones much sooner than any unethical AI possibly can,&#8221; Hui said. &#8220;What we realized was we don't have to be medical professionals. We don't have to be doctors, nurses or anything like that. ... When we help our health care providers and keep them safe, they in turn can help save our loved ones.&#8221; ",[],"['campus', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/3DPrinterDesignviaKyleHo.jpg

I&#8217;ve heard countless versions of this phrase over the years, but nothing taught me it quite like my time at the Daily Bruin.  I entered Kerckhoff 118 as a freshman with my mind set on the conventional route &#8211; get hired as a Sports intern, work my way up to becoming an assistant editor and then keep writing as senior staff until I graduated. I had always been someone who preferred to be under the radar and let my writing do most of the talking.  Let&#8217;s just say things turned out a little different than what I pictured.  There&#8217;s nothing that can really prepare you for dozens of staffers striking against your selection as editor in chief, or a global pandemic causing you to shut down print production for the first time in 100 years. But if I&#8217;ve learned one thing in the last four years, it&#8217;s to expect the unexpected and know everything happens for a reason.  I know it sounds cliche, but I spent hours outside the office asking myself: &#8220;Why?&#8221; Why did I want to be editor in chief? Why did printing a paper every day mean so much? And why did I know I had to stick it out even in the toughest moments?  It was all because of the people &#8211; those who taught me, those who worked with me and those who believed in me more than I believed in myself.  Hanson and David &#8211; thank you for being my editors, teaching me how to conduct an interview and write a meow. If you hadn&#8217;t invested your time in me and saw the potential of a shy freshman with no journalism experience, I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today.  Jacqueline, Coral, Dylan, Marcus, Cassidy, Riley and everyone on the Sports staff &#8211; thank you for trusting me as an editor and allowing me to learn alongside you. You are all superstars and it&#8217;s been an honor to work with each and every one of you.  Ryan, Sam and Gabe &#8211; thank you for being the greatest friends and having my back during the most challenging times. From every deep talk to road trip, I can&#8217;t imagine UCLA without you guys.   Kristie and Joy &#8211; thank you for choosing to lead this newsroom alongside me and for believing in my vision. This year hasn&#8217;t been easy, but we&#8217;ve come such a long way and I truly couldn&#8217;t ask for a better team of queens.  And to the staff I&#8217;ve had the privilege of leading this year &#8211; thank you for inspiring and motivating me through all the crazy and stressful moments. You all are incredible people and phenomenal journalists, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what you&#8217;re going to do next.  I think it&#8217;s safe to say my tenure as editor in chief has been different than any other in recent history. I had to learn not everyone is going to be your biggest supporter, and nothing ever goes exactly according to plan. The Daily Bruin challenged me in more ways than I ever thought it would, but I leave knowing I&#8217;m the strongest person I&#8217;ve ever been.  Was every moment easy? No.  But nothing worthwhile ever is.   Forburger was a Sports contributor 2016-2017, Sports reporter 2017-2018, assistant Sports editor 2018-2019 and editor in chief 2019-2020.

The Westwood Village Improvement Association purchased discounted meals from local restaurants using donations in order to provide them with a business opportunity and chance to support hospital workers at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.  &#8220;(We wanted) to show our appreciation to our frontline workers who are heroes during this public health crisis,&#8221; said Andrew Thomas, executive director of the WVIA.  &#8220;This was (also) an opportunity for us to use the money raised to buy slightly discounted meals from our restaurants, give them a big order and infuse them with a little bit of capital.&#8221;  WVIA&#8217;s ambassadors &#8211; employees who, among other tasks, provide information to visitors and merchants and report maintenance issues  began delivering meals from restaurants to the medical center Thursday, Thomas said. Each restaurant prepared roughly 100-200 meals, including vegetarian and vegan options, on their chosen delivery day, providing over 1,200 meals for five days.  The WVIA exceeded its initial goal of $5,000 in donations for the meals and received a total of $12,405  as of Thursday. The funds came from various individuals and organizations, with an additional $1,000 grant from the  North Westwood Neighborhood Council, a local body that represents Westwood Village to the Los Angeles City Council.  &#8220;People who love the Village and UCLA one way or another just want to participate however they can, so I&#8217;m excited we had this idea and we&#8217;re able to give people an outlet,&#8221; Thomas said.  Michael Skiles, president of the NWWNC, said the city of LA gave neighborhood council presidents the power to distribute up to $5,000 from their council&#8217;s fund for coronavirus  emergency  response.  Skiles said he believed this funding decision best reflected the interests of the community. He made the decision on behalf of the council because the NWWNC can no longer meet, even virtually, because of open meeting requirements, he added.  The WVIA requested its participating restaurants provide meals for $10 or less to maximize the value of donations to the fund, while still providing economic benefit to the establishments, Thomas said.  Miguel Anaya Jr., co-owner of Pinches Tacos and a UCLA alumnus, said he joined the effort because he believes in the importance of supporting frontline workers. Growing up, Anaya and his family would only eat if they had enough food to share, a value that inspired him to give back to the community, he added.  &#8220;I have the strong belief that it&#8217;s times like this that define who we are as individuals, as a community, and as a society; and when you&#8217;re asked to help, especially our heroes, at the moment, how could you not say yes?&#8221; Anaya said.  Pinches Tacos was one of eight restaurants to participate. Another to join was Bollywood Bites, an Indian cuisine restaurant co-owned by Priyanka Mathur.  &#8220;I think the underlying (reason) is to contribute to our health care workers or to anyone (else) in our community,&#8221; Mathur said. &#8220;We have been a part of (similar) kinds of initiatives in Westwood in the past.&#8221;  Medy Sanadidi, co-owner of Bella Pita and a retired UCLA computer science professor, said the food drive allowed him to keep his employees working and paid during the pandemic.  While the WVIA&#8217;s order from Flame Broiler, another participant, did not notably profit the restaurant, it gave its employees more hours of work, thereby providing them with more income, Kifishia Kawachi, the owner, said.  The WVIA also reached out to Rocket Fizz for candy and snack deliveries. Nicole Ramon, associate of Rocket Fizz, said the establishment provided approximately $1,000&#8217;s worth of candy and snacks, including animal crackers, crunchy bars and different types of cookies.  &#8220;We thought (the UCLA frontline workers) are going through such a hard time, ... putting their lives at risk and keeping us safe every day,&#8221; Ramon said. &#8220;So we wanted to give back in any way we possibly could, and we thought maybe we could add a little sweetness to their really rough days.

The former microbiology and molecular genetics student at UCLA said he had read up on the coronavirus and told his team about it weeks before it ended No. 9 UCLA men&#8217;s volleyball&#8217;s (10-9, 2-3 MPSF) season for good.   Nonetheless, redshirt junior outside hitter/setter Sam Kobrine said he was taken aback when he heard the news.  &#8220;I was pretty shocked that they actually ended it that quickly, but I mean coach Speraw was talking about it weeks before, preparing us,&#8221; Kobrine said. &#8220;When it actually happened it was definitely very shocking &#8211; very, very shocking.&#8221;  On March 12, the NCAA announced it would be canceling all winter and spring championships because of the spread of  COVID-19. With that announcement came an abrupt end to not just the Bruins&#8217; season, but countless seasons across the school, state and nation.  Because their seasons had to be cut short, spring student-athletes were granted an additional year of eligibility by the NCAA. However, some seniors &#8211;  such as outside hitter Austin Matautia, middle blockers Matt Younggren and Daenan Gyimah &#8211; have already taken to social media announcing their departures from the team.   Speraw said it remains unclear who of the remaining seniors will return to Westwood next year to play for the Bruins.  &#8220;We&#8217;re still kind of working through which guys are going to return and which guys aren&#8217;t,&#8221; Speraw said. &#8220;I&#8217;d still love the opportunity to have one more shot with those guys.&#8221;  Unique to this year&#8217;s team were the 12 freshmen and redshirt freshmen, accounting for more than half the roster and setting the single-season high for most freshmen to suit up for a UCLA men's volleyball team on record.   Not only were the freshmen listed, but they were featured frequently as well. Eight out of the twelve freshmen played in at least one match and of the seven season leaders in matches played, five were freshmen.   Kobrine said he was optimistic about the future of the program given the young core of talented players that have benefitted from the lessons of the team's upperclassmen.  &#8220;Off the court, (the freshmen were) more professional, just taking care of other responsibilities like school, film, working out, those are the things I think the seniors did a good job of teaching,&#8221; Kobrine said. &#8220;They are incredibly talented for freshmen. You don&#8217;t see that that often &#8211; that many young guys getting to play at a really prestigious UCLA program.&#8221;  While the Bruins ended the season just a game above .500, five days prior to the NCAA&#8217;s announcement, UCLA knocked off No. 6 UC San Diego. After losing to the Tritons earlier in the season, the Bruins secured their second win of the season against a top-10 team in what turned out to be their final match of 2020.  The first of those two upsets came on the road against No.4 Long Beach State. Prior to the win, the Bruins had lost six straight matches to the Beach over the course of the past three seasons, including the 2018 national championship.  &#8220;Our win against Long Beach State stood out for me,&#8221; Kobrine said. &#8220;As a team that beat us in the national championship, beat us last couple years, and then we&#8217;re finally able to go to Long Beach State and beat them, so that was definitely a big step for our program considering how the past has gone.&#8221;  Coming up on UCLA's schedule were more chances to right its wrongs against opponents who it had lost to earlier in the season, as it had against UCSD.  &#8220;I think the hard part about this year was that we were just starting to get a little bit better, and I felt like we had an opportunity to surprise some teams down at the end,&#8221; Speraw said. &#8220;I just liked the direction we were going, especially in that last week that we were training. ... We tinkered around with the lineup in a particular way that was really impactful for us. I don&#8217;t think anybody even ever saw that lineup, so we&#8217;ll just have to save that for next year.&#8221;    ",['cap-jake-greenberg-bell'],"['mens-volleyball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/DSC_8036.jpg

The paper, which was published March 23 by the Voting Rights Project, an advocacy program of the UCLA Latino Policy &amp; Politics Initiative, emphasizes the need to expand access to vote-by-mail in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led many states to postpone their primary elections.  Sonni Waknin, a legal fellow for the Voting Rights Project who co-authored and coordinated the research for and production of the paper, said she thinks vote-by-mail is the system best suited to meet the need of the hour.  Right now, models show that theres a possibility of the pandemic spiking again in October, November and December, kind of similar to how the flu weaves in and out, Waknin said. If that occurs, people are going to have to social distance, and with social distancing comes not being able to vote in person.  Even if the coronavirus were to subside, voters are still likely to avoid large gatherings which are common at in-person voting centers, Waknin said. Vote-by-mail is a safer alternative to traditional in-person voting since the risk of transmission is theoretical and minimal, according to the paper.  Chad Dunn, director of litigation at the Voting Rights Project and a co-author of the paper, said he thinks in-person voting will likely still need to be an important part of the electoral process, but added legislators must plan to take the pressure off it by implementing wide-scale vote-by-mail.  The idea is an all-of-the-above strategy, Dunn said. We have in-person voting, we ramp up vote-by-mail, make it universal. We begin preparing for it now, printing the ballots, building the scanners, training the staff and assigning other government staff thats otherwise furloughed during this work as essential election personnel.  In addition to introducing universal vote-by-mail, the paper also recommends modifying in-person voting centers to limit person-to-person contact, establishing secure and accessible ballot drop-off locations and implementing measures to ensure voting security and equity.  Even in the absence of a pandemic, vote-by-mail can increase voter convenience, potentially improve voter turnout and strengthen security from digital hacking efforts, Dunn said.  It substantially lowers the burden to vote, he said. It also gives voters the opportunity to consider their ballot. Youre not queued up in a line and people are waiting for you to vote and get out of the way, ... and in a lot of ways, its more secure.  Dunn added he thinks the current situation in particular calls for Congress to establish standardized guidelines and funding for states to implement vote-by-mail.  The point is, right now, we dont have a choice, Dunn said.  However, there are some challenges with implementing a universal vote-by-mail system, such as the screening of ballots, language accessibility and the potential for disparate impact on communities unlikely to have permanent addresses or P.O. boxes.  Waknin said one significant challenge with vote-by-mail systems is that older voters and primarily voters of color can be disenfranchised through the signature verification process, in which the signature of the voter is used to confirm their identity. Signature verification is currently conducted with different standards across states.  Thats why you need to have an alternative to signature verification ... you need to have another alternative where voters are able to verify their identity, Waknin said. You also need to have a curing period, which means that you notify voters when there is a discrepancy within their ballots, and they are given the opportunity to come in and correct, or cure, any errors within their mail ballot.  Even as Republicans rely on vote-by-mail in strongholds such as Utah and Arizona, there is fierce opposition to implementing universal vote-by-mail from the White House and Senate Republicans.  All of the academic studies done on wide-scale vote-by-mail show that turnouts increase all around, Dunn said. The election results are more or less the same, but more people get to participate. And, you know, theres some places where increased turnout benefits Republicans, (and) places where it benefits Democrats.  Elisa Chang, a graduate student in education at UCLA and campaign coordinator for UCLA California Public Interest Research Groups New Voters Project, said the campaigns she has been organizing also focus on vote-by-mail as the preferred way for students to vote in the upcoming primaries and presidential election.  (Vote-by-mail) gives students the ability to vote from the comfort of their own home and send an absentee ballot, Chang said.  However, Chang added that she thinks there needs to be public education on vote-by-mail and how students can go about it. The New Voters Project is working on increasing education around vote-by-mail and ensuring that mail ballots are accessible to everyone, Chang said.  Vote-by-mail is just very easy and very accessible, she said. As long as you are registered to vote by the deadline (in California), you will receive your ballot prior to Election Day.  The Voting Rights Project is urging Congress to ensure that any COVID-19 response bill that comes before the House and Senate includes a provision that requires sending vote-by-mail ballots to all registered voters, Waknin added.  Were (seven) months out from the election, Waknin said.

But while some portrayals successfully shine a light on mental health conditions, others merely perpetuate stigmas and stereotypes. Columnist Alissa Evans puts her cognitive science degree to use in Silver Screen Psychology, comparing movies and shows that boast accurate depictions of mental health to those that sacrifice authenticity for drama.    Anxiety is no stranger  amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Even before the   virus   turned daily life upside down, anxiety disorders were some of the most prevalent mental illnesses in the United States, affecting  18.1%  of the population per year, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.  And in popular media, films like Midsommar, The Perks of Being a Wallflower and even Finding Nemo continue to lean on such conditions to further their plots. But while narratives frequently explore trauma and stressor-related disorders, like PTSD, and specific anxiety disorders, like social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD, remains underrepresented in mainstream media. David Kronemyer, a UCLA clinical facility and research scientist at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior Anxiety and Related Disorders Center, said the general feelings of misalignment or unsettledness that are often characteristic of GAD may be difficult to convey on screen.  There's this kind of a thought-to-world mismatch ... so in a way, you're alienated or ... out of calibration with reality, Kronemyer said. Its hard to portray something that is that vague and that ambiguous, especially for movies, which need a beginning, a middle and an end.   [Related:    Silver Screen Psychology: Looking into the ways movies, TV shows depict depression   ]   Films therefore rely on more specialized types of anxiety disorders with concrete and traceable causes to propel the story forward.  Social anxiety  is one such disorder, which is a fear of social situations and of being judged by others to the point of interference with daily life. The median  age of onset  of social anxiety disorder is 13 years old, which may explain why it is heavily featured in teen dramas like Eighth Grade and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Kronemyer said this early onset is partially because of the fact that adolescence is an extremely sensitive period in one's developmental cycle.  Many coming-of-age films depict this sensitive period sympathetically. In Eighth Grade, Kayla agonizes over every word she speaks and every Instagram filter she uses, but instead of treating her worries as superficial, the film empathizes with her intense fear of judgment. As Kayla grips the bathroom sink and gasps for air before making an appearance at the popular girls pool party, the viewer can almost feel  or perhaps even recall  the anxiety shes experiencing.  Charlie grapples with many of the same fears in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and his struggle to make meaningful connections at a new school can be relatable to teenagers and adults alike. But despite the signs of social anxiety, the film devotes more attention to Charlies PTSD. Charlie experiences dissociation and intrusive memories  both of which are common  symptoms of PTSD   that ultimately contribute to a panic attack and a stay in a psychiatric hospital.  As is typically true with anxiety disorders and related disorders like PTSD, Charlie cannot use repression or distraction to overcome his trauma. Kronemyer said its virtually impossible to lessen the frequency and power of intrusive thoughts simply by thinking or talking about them  this merely makes them more salient and often leads to a recursive thinking loop.  It's like a game of Chutes and Ladders,"" Kronemyer said.""You get to the top and then you slide back down again and then you get back to the top and you slide back down again because you cannot fight thinking with more thinking.   [Related:    Silver Screen Psychology: While some films explore schizophrenia sensitively, others perpetuate stereotypes   ]   Instead, Kronemyer said altering one's behavioral trajectory by shifting attention from internal mental processes to the external world is beneficial. He said it is important for people to gradually    with the help of a therapist  confront whatever it is that is causing the distressing thoughts. One helpful method is exposure therapy, which requires those with PTSD to delve into their trauma or fears until the memories no longer wield the same power, he said.  This process of confrontation is central to Honey Boy, which is based on Shia Labeoufs real-life experiences in rehab. The resident therapist tells Otis  who is diagnosed with PTSD  to write down   his memories of his abusive, alcoholic father. As is the case with exposure therapy, the exercise forces Otis to acknowledge his trauma so he can regain control over his life and his psyche.  The portrayal is ultimately effective, partly because PTSD often lends itself to the cause-and-effect structure of films and TV shows. With a trauma that is clearly defined, visual flashbacks offer a direct way to convey the experience of PTSD while maintaining narrative structure. Unsurprisingly, some of the most popular film and TV franchises including Breaking Bad, The Hunger Games, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe all feature characters with PTSD-like symptoms.  But GAD is not nearly as prominent in popular media. GAD can be  characterized by  excessive worry  as well as difficulty relaxing and making decisions  and may cause people to feel like the world is a dangerous place or like theyre constantly awaiting disaster, Kronemyer said. Because the disorder is typically not as concrete as depression or PTSD, he said it is less understood by the general public and even harder to portray visually.    Perhaps if there were more examples of GAD in the media that explicitly explore the disorder, people would better understand the symptoms and would be more likely to seek help. Films and television shows should work to broaden their depictions of anxiety by illustrating that it does not always have a clearly defined cause nor a clearly defined solution. Similarly, Kronemyer said people need to expand their views of the world beyond their restrictive mental models which can impose strict, anxiety-inducing expectations when relied on too heavily.  Its when those (heuristics) become inhibitory or they become biases or prejudices that they can really hold us back, Kronemyer said. The thing that we've got to do is learn a different kind of a mental model, one that's based on elasticity and flexibility.",['cap-alissa-evans'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ae_.silverscreenpsychology.3.courtesy.jpg

A mantra in real estate and an unfortunate reality for proper access to health care.  In Los Angeles County, those who live in low-income communities are  three  times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those in wealthier areas. People of color are also disproportionately affected. Black people make up 9% of the County's population, yet account for a staggering        15%  of coronavirus-related deaths.  Regardless, LA's wealthier zip codes have reported significantly higher  cases . This is not because such areas are at a higher risk; instead, the numbers are a result of significantly lower rates of testing in lower-income neighborhoods.  Just two weeks ago, Mayor Eric Garcetti expanded free COVID-19 testing to all LA County  residents . However, expanding testing is not the same thing as providing equal access to it.  People from underserved communities are more likely to die from coronavirus, due to existing disparities in access to health care and   a continued lack of proper prevention and treatment. The county must do more to adequately expand testing to its most vulnerable populations  and UCLA can be a part of those efforts. From increasing communication about available resources to easing restrictions on access to testing, LA County and UCLA Health can help by improving testing efforts in the most marginalized neighborhoods.  Coronavirus-related death rates in neighborhoods such as East Hollywood, Pico-Union and Westlake are  four  times higher than the national average. These are the same areas where more than one-third of housing is overcrowded.    Timothy Brewer, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and Medicine, said there are big differences in the healthcare statistics between areas like West and South LA.  In areas where there are more African Americans in particular, those areas tend to be more crowded  they tend to be poorer,"" Brewer said. ""They tend to have fewer health care facilities, and the health care facilities tend to be of lesser quality than in high-income areas.  Unfortunately, certain populations are at an extremely high risk simply by virtue of their zip code.  Systemic solutions are necessary to address these disparities, but in the mean time, proper testing and prevention is the least that LA County can provide. One way is to make sure that hospitals and clinics in low-income areas are properly  staffed  and have adequate resources. It's also important that these communities continue to get proper and updated information.  And UCLA has the resources to help. In early April, UCLA Health  initiated  testing for all incoming surgical and procedural patients, as well as ER admissions. UCLA can work with clinics in lower-income areas to launch expanded efforts.  Populations that have historically had little to no access to proper health care are just as susceptible to catching the virus, if not more. California Governor Gavin Newsom estimates that  60,000  people experiencing homelessness will become infected. In a     county with the  second  highest rate of unsheltered individuals, these populations might not have access to food or shelter, let alone proper medical care.  These things that create pollutants tend to be much more common in people of color communities and poor communities,"" said Nina Harawa, a professor-in-residence with the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""Literally the bodies of people in those communities are predisposed to have poor outcomes related to (COVID-19).  In California, Latinos and African Americans are exposed to  40%  more pollution than white people  making them more susceptible to coronavirus-related complications.  As a massive health care provider with offices spread across the city, UCLA Health can work with LA county to ensure that these populations get the information they need when it comes to accessible testing options and preventative measures.  Furthermore, undocumented workers, many of whom are working essential jobs and are at a greater risk, have no access to employment benefits or paid sick leave, despite being underpaid. They, along with mixed-status families such as DACA recipients or those with immigrant spouses, also wont get  access  to the stimulus check provided by the CARES Act.  And the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which covers testing for all uninsured workers, excludes those who are undocumented  regardless of the fact that they pay taxes.    And the legacy of the countrys improper treatment of undocumented individuals may heighten fears of deportation if they try to access medical care. ICE agents made arrests on the  first day  of Californias official lockdown.  They made it seem like you can come get it, you can come get the test, regardless of your immigration status, but (they're) not thinking about how undocumented folks may still be hesitant and may not trust what they are saying, said Daniela Rodriguez, a fourth-year sociology student.  One major deterrent is the current identification  requirement  for an individual to receive testing. And while LA County has promised not to use identification for purposes of law enforcement, loosening ID requirements could greatly increase accessibility for low-income and marginalized communities.    Undocumented populations should not have to choose between their health and physical safety. It is vital that the county keeps an open line of communication with the undocumented community, so they can receive the correct information and proper testing.  Granted, LA County has already greatly expanded its testing capacity. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. With the help of institutions like UCLA Health, the county must now make sure that testing is not just equally available, but equitably delivered. Because although the expansion towards universal testing is expensive, there is no other alternative.  &nbsp;  Anyone, regardless of socioeconomic status, race or citizenship can become sick and spread the virus. Selectively ignoring already marginalized populations on the grounds of arbitrary social classifications will only prolong the virus' reign and cause more avoidable deaths.  The virus does not discriminate and we cannot afford to either.",['cap-navdeep-bal'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/image-2.jpeg

A number of student groups, including UCLA Students Against Hindutva, Muslim Student Association at UCLA, Indus at UCLA and UCLA Sikh Student Association joined at least 18 other universities across the nation to protest Hindutva, a form of Hindu nationalism.      The Indian government has been ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party for six years. It recently incited backlash after passing the Citizenship Amendment Act in December. The act has been accused of discriminating against Muslim people.  The CAA provides a quicker path to citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who came to India from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan prior to 2015. However, Muslim people cannot access this faster path.  The Indian government announced in November that it would be implementing a National Register of Citizens nationwide that attempts to identify Indian citizens and illegal immigrants based on documentation.  Some critics have said the CAA would allow non-Muslims to become citizens and get on the register, while Muslims would not be able to obtain citizenship as easily.  The implementation of the CAA and NRC led to protests nationwide, especially from students.  Following the protests, pro-CAA riots broke out across the country. Protests were particularly violent in New Delhi, where Muslims were targeted in Delhis North East District. Rioters demolished four mosques, killed more than 50 people, injured more than 200 and burned down multiple Muslim-owned properties.  UCLA students said they participated in the protest on campus to raise greater awareness about what is happening in India.  Aroushi Taneja, a third-year statistics student, said she joined the UCLA protest in order to speak out against Hindutva, which she called a fascist ideology responsible for the CAA.  The main thing we want to do is spread awareness, she said. We want to spread the message and want people to know whats happening in India because it hasnt gotten any media coverage.  Some UCLA students said they are personally affected by the protests in India and found it especially important to stand in solidarity.  Iman Noory, a graduate student, was a speaker at the event. She said her family has personally felt the effects in Delhi.  Just last week, the neighbor of my family in Delhi lost his entire pharmacy to a fire ignited by a Hindutva mob, she said. In just one day, his entire livelihood was destroyed.  Her cousins are having trouble getting to their final exams since its too risky for them to leave their homes, she said.  She said that even though she lives in the United States, she has also felt the effects of Hindutva.  Where once I felt a sense of familiarity and warmth when I saw another Indian, now many times I feel isolated, secluded and othered, as Im visibly Muslim, she said. Just the other day, I was in Artesia, where the shopkeeper selling Indian clothes refused to help us.  Taneja said people who are pro-CAA believe the bill has good intentions and is trying to be inclusive of people who need refuge.  However, she said this is inaccurate, and that groups who need refuge, such as the Rohingya people of Myanmar, are persecuted but wont receive refuge because they are Muslim.  Shatakshi Mohan, a fourth-year statistics student who also protested, said she thought India was an extremely tolerant country when she was growing up. She said she is disheartened to see the rising intolerance.  Its like a general sense of despair, she said. When I went back home to India for winter break, all the conversations were about this. Genuinely, even my communities seem divided.  At the same time, UCLA graduate students were protesting for a cost of living adjustment. After concluding their own demonstration, the anti-Hindutva protesters marched over to join the graduate students.  The situation in India is a global human rights issue, Mohan said. She said she hopes that more people in America pay attention to the situation.  You should care about human rights, irrespective of the fact that the humans are halfway across the world, she said. A lot of parallels have been drawn between modern Indian and modern American politics. So I believe that if youre able to find similarities, then you would automatically feel passionate about whats happening in India as well.  &nbsp;",['cap-saumya-gupta'],"['campus', 'international', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.indusprotest.TS_.jpg

The sharp, short and lyrically stark album, ""how im feeling now,"" was produced as an affecting   response to COVID-19 and the subsequent quarantine period. Charli took to Twitter in early April, asking fans to participate in the creative decision-making process  track names, cover art and running time  behind her next album, which the singer started and finished while much of the world was ordered to stay at home.  ""how i'm feeling now"" presents a poignant, electronic portrait of a star stuck in her own head and attempting to relate to an inaccessible outside world. The LP is loaded with sparkling sound but never useless noise, making it the quintessential quarantine creation  a structurally solid and thematically thorough album grasping at connection while in isolation.  The listening experience begins with a bang. The shocking sonic language of ""pink diamond"" brilliantly fades from aggressive bass drum grinds and strobing synths into blown-out backup vocals. As she sings ""I just wanna go real hard,"" and ""I got a big heart/ On the video chat,"" the singer tactfully introduces her intent for the rest of the album:   lyrical intensity mixed with sonic lightness as a way to connect with listeners during uncertain times.  The fourth track 7 Years"" solidifies the singer's contrast of bright sound and complex emotional investigation. Rhythmic crashing drums crowd a soundscape already full of bubbly synths while Charli sings So hard, things that weve been through, yeah/ Could've fallen, but we only grew."" While its unclear who she's speaking to  an enigmatic love interest or the fans with whom she worked to create music  the ambiguity works in favor of the album attempting to cover a lot of emotional ground.  The introspective examination of wrought feelings continues as instrumentals fade into ""detonate,"" a clear sonic standout on the album with effervescent and dynamic percussion that masterfully constructs a story. Full of muffled, futuristic beeps and high-pitched staccato piano keys, the track tells a love story, which speeds up from a breathy and moody lyrical declaration of dominance into its final form as an concession of insecurity.     Charli's mid-point shift from impenetrable to vulnerable in the track makes it fit like the final piece of a puzzle into the record's larger narrative of how the singer is feeling now  lovesick and confused.  Compared to the consistent novelty in the album's opening, its second half drones slightly, coming close to simply repeating musical motifs  mechanical screeches, bubbly synths and descending crashes  rather than reprising them. In particular, enemy,"" i finally understand and ""c2.0 meld together in the album's center, ultimately feeling like the same 30-second riff stuck on loop. Where all the previous tracks hold tight to the notion that synthetic roars and shrieks are an appropriate response to the current events, the repeated sonic overload in the second half of the album sets the theme adrift.  As quickly as it's lost, the final three songs of the album find again the emotional intent of connection while separated, finishing off in an ode to early 2000s nostalgia with notes of her trademark dance-pop music.  party 4 u, another standout among the songs, is the single that is the most lyrically heavy and sonically pared-back Charli has been in recent years. Her undeniably strong grasp of millennial melancholy shines with lyrics like ""Called your digits, but the phone kept ringin'"" that aptly recognize the distress of finding love in a technologically advanced world. A shift from the clean, single-track vocals to a layered chorus also brings listeners on a five-minute journey through the stir-crazy mind of a lovelorn and daydreaming pop star.  As if to bookend an abrupt listening experience, how im feeling now screeches to a stop after a short 37 minutes. Despite some momentary sonic confusion with repetition of musical tropes and sensory overload, the album is an overall successful attempt to create an escape from current events, while simultaneously diving headfirst into them.  With what is both an interstellar odyssey and a vulnerable love letter, Charli has returned to her rave roots while remaining topical with the mechanical but bright journey of ""how im feeling now.""",['cap-annika-carlson'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/charli-xcx.jpg

Due to the current pandemic, there has been a shortage of PPE, including gloves, masks, face shields and gowns, which leaves some health care workers ill-equipped to safely treat their patients. This has even caused the World Health Organization to estimate a needed 40% increase in manufacturing.  Judy Choe, a part-time student at the School of Management and attending physician in UCLA Healths Department of Emergency Medicine, is the primary organizer of the drives. Choe said the idea stemmed from watching her colleagues in New York struggle with the lack of PPE supplies.  The management school team is focused on providing PPE to local hospitals and clinics that are experiencing shortages, as well as helping them prepare for a potential surge of new COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles, she added.  PPE is a standard barrier that all health care professionals need, Choe said. My thought was, if we all work together to ensure our entire community is safe (with adequate PPE supplies), then that, with a shelter-in-place, will help flatten our curve even further.  Angela Arunarsirakul, a full-time student at the School of Management, has been helping out with the publicity of the donation drives.  One of the reasons for the shortage in PPE supplies is because people have been hoarding equipment out of desperation, Arunarsirakul said. Additionally, suppliers are not able to supply or produce PPE quickly enough, she said.  Were all trying to help out in our own ways, Arunarsirakul said. I'm sure that some of us have this equipment that we don't exactly need, or at least maybe we need them but not as much as the medical professionals do.  [caption id=""attachment_379075"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Volunteers held signs to advertise one of the first drives undertaken by the students. The team was able to collect upward of 3,000 N95 masks and hundreds of boxes of gloves and eye shields in two drives, and it is currently planning to get more donations. (Courtesy of Judy Choe)[/caption]  Caleb Maxson, a part-time student at the School of Management who is volunteering at the donation drives, said it is important for local communities to supplement the support provided by the government and other institutions because it is easier for smaller hospitals and clinics to be overlooked.  Choe pitched the idea to the School of Management's Slack channel, where she received immediate responses from her classmates in the full-time, part-time and executive Master of Business Administration programs, who all wanted to contribute to and collaborate on the project. The School of Management's faculty and staff were supportive and the deans helped to introduce and spread the word about the initiative, Choe said.  Arunarsirakul said she was pleasantly surprised by how the first drive was set up within a couple of weeks.  There's a lot of needs that need to be met right now. And as much as we'd like to plan for the perfect drive, making sure that there's a lot of publicity and, doing things like that in any way that we can help people out with our actions, then we should definitely go for it. So I'm really proud of (Choe), for doing that, Arunarsirakul said.  Choe said the team was able to collect upward of 3,000 N95 masks and hundreds of boxes of gloves and eye shields in two of the drives. Although their marketing approach was successful, she said she and her team think the donations will soon run out.  In order to increase that supply, they set up a GoFundMe page with other PPE drive organizations and are vetting suppliers so that equipment can be purchased for local hospitals.  Maxson said the main challenge going forward is the uncertainty of how the situation will evolve.  We started off collecting PPE and donations for PPE, but if challenges persist, the actions needed to address them will evolve, Maxson said. As a group, we will need to assess our role as the situation changes.  Choe added that the community has responded with donations every week, and continues to reach out, asking how they can help in the fight against COVID-19.  I hope, much like everyone else does, that a successful vaccine will be developed and administered to protect our communities, Choe said. In the meantime, hospitals need to be judicious in our use of PPE supplies, because the road ahead is long and uncertain. Until we can all return our new normal, it's essential that we focus on the safety of the front-line teams with adequate PPE.",['cap-shruti-iyer'],"['campus', 'news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.news_.PPEdrives.courtesy.jpg

No. 2 UCLA beach volleyball (13-2) was less than halfway done with its 2020 campaign before the coronavirus caused all college sports' seasons to be canceled. The Bruins were on a six-game winning streak and looking forward to competing for another national championship when the announcement was made.  We did have a great opportunity this year to three-peat, coach Stein Metzger said. I thought we had a very strong team, and (the cancelation) was extremely disappointing for everyone.  The Bruins ended their season ranked second in the country, winning 13 games while playing 15 out of the 39 that were originally scheduled. They had six shutouts on the season and recorded two wins against crosstown rival No. 6 USC (6-5). Their two losses of the season were both 3-2 matches at the hands of No.1 LSU (12-2).  Despite the cancellation of the season and the many miles between players, the team is still trying to work on their skills and stay as connected as possible.  We are still having gym calls with coaches every week, and we have team calls to keep in touch, freshman Lexy Denaburg said. Being away is just really hard because they are my best friends.  Senior Savvy Simo played four seasons of indoor volleyball - earning an All-American nod this past season - and three seasons of beach volleyball, winning two national championships. Despite being on the opposite end of her UCLA career as her younger teammate, she echoed a similar sentiment.  You never really think that a season can be taken away, especially from an entire team, Simo said. My biggest takeaway is to never take for granted the opportunities to travel, to spend time together, to practice together, to win and lose together, even just to see each other every day because you never know.  As the team continues to reflect on the season that could have been, it is also beginning to make preparations for next years team. The coaches have set up one-on-one meetings with each player to make sure they are still training in the time off. Players such as Denaburg have said they are doing cardio at their houses and have family members who have help with reps and drills.  However, with all beaches closed and no teammates to practice with, many members of the team have been faced with the reality that their progress - as individuals and as a team - has been put on hold.  You just cant simulate or duplicate the kind of work that we get done on Mapes Beach, Metzger said. I know it's going to take a while to get everyone playing at the level they were at when we stopped, but we will take it one day at a time once we get that chance.  One aspect of the team that will be changing before next year is the roster. The Bruins have currently signed two new players to the 2021 roster, Peri Brennan and Tessa Van Winkle.  Brennan played both indoor and beach in high school and is the No. 1-ranked adult player in the California Beach Volleyball Association. Van Winkle also played both indoor and beach, won two CBVA women's volleyball tournaments, and is the younger sister of current Bruin sophomore Abby Van Winkle.  While new players are being added to the team, the current seniors  Lily Justine, Madi Yeomans and Simo  must still decide on their plans for next year. The NCAA has allowed all spring senior athletes to return to school for one more season, so there is a possibility that none of the current seniors will leave the team.  Ultimately, this decision will be up to each individual athlete, but one has already expressed interest in returning to UCLA.  I definitely am considering it, Simo said. Ive been in contact with the coaches, and they are supportive of me coming back if I do want to come back. Were waiting to see how it all plays out but, as of now, (coming back) is the plan, and Im really excited about it.  All three seniors have been on the team since their freshman years and they were all a part of both championship-winning teams. This year, Yeomans played most of her matches on court five, while Justine mainly competed on court three. Simo played in every match this season, always competing on court one.  Although there is still some uncertainty surrounding the future, the team is mainly just waiting to get back out onto the courts at Mapes Beach.  At the end of the day, we are lucky to be able to play at all, Metzger said. When we come back, we are going to be very grateful.",['cap-lexi-grimes'],"['beach-volleyball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.sp_.bvb_.nbk_.AD_.jpg

However, stories from past Daily Bruin issues give insight into how UCLA has grappled with and promoted changes in technology over the years, leading us to the virtual university that is now, at least temporarily, our new normal.      To begin,   UCLA has been a  driving force  in the development of computers and the internet since the late 1940s, beginning with the establishment of the Institute for Numerical Analysis on the UCLA campus in 1947.  The institute aimed to facilitate research in mathematics relevant to the development of computing machinery.  In 1969,   the year following the establishment of UCLA&#8217;s computer science program, a group of   computer scientists working in Boelter Hall created the world&#8217;s first network connection, part of what is known as ARPANET.  The  internet was born  on Oct. 29 of the same year when this team, under the direction of UCLA computer science professor Leonard Kleinrock, used ARPANET to transmit a message to the Stanford Research Institute.  Of course, the internet still had   quite a bit of evolution to undergo before it would become what it is today.   For example,   the team of computer scientists had intended to send the message &#8220;LOGIN.&#8221;  However, the system crashed and cut the word off at the first two letters.   Kleinrock took this in stride and reinterpreted the incomplete word ""LO"" as the beginning of ""Lo and behold."" Although unintended, the spontaneous message aptly foreshadowed the profound impact the internet would have on humanity.   Now, thanks to the internet, some 40,000 UCLA students are exchanging messages, submitting papers, attending class and hosting graduation parties online in an effort to hold our community together during these unpredictable times.  Lo and behold, indeed.    According to a Daily Bruin  article  from 1970, the switchover to a computerized enrollment process at UCLA resulted in technical and logistical issues reminiscent of the sudden transition to online courses in March due to COVID-19. Whereas students would previously sign up for classes in person at   the various departments, computerized enrollment was meant to streamline the process by allowing students to enroll in classes across departments simultaneously at ""television-type terminals"" located in Ackerman Union.  Students designed much of the enrollment system's ""software,"" which in the original article from 1970 was a word put in quotes and followed by a thorough explanation of its meaning.  Needless to say, times have changed.   Aside from occasional crashes, the technical system operated relatively smoothly.  Difficulties arose primarily from oversights in communication and organization which, in the words of Daily Bruin staff writer A.L. Haskins, resulted in a &#8220;logistical fiasco.&#8221; Haskins said in the article that enrollment instructions were unclear and administrators, as well as faculty members, were unable to help students. Consequently, thousands of students waited in line for hours to access the terminals used to enroll in classes.  The switch to digital learning platforms because of COVID-19 has also resulted in various obstacles for the UCLA community. In addition to standard issues like spotty Wi-Fi and sharing small spaces with housemates or family, this transition has manifested more serious problems at UCLA such as incidents of racist ""Zoombombing"" in which individuals have used Zoom to anonymously interrupt classes with racial slurs.   [Related:  Racist &#8216;Zoombombing&#8217; incidents at UCLA disrupt online classes and students ]   The unfavorable student reactions that the Daily Bruin reported in 1970 after this switchover reflect   some of the difficulties students are currently experiencing with online learning.  However, while the computerized enrollment system initially experienced some growing pains, it eventually became a permanent change that ultimately provided a more efficient method for students to enroll in their classes.  On the other hand, while the University of Zoom, Los Angeles &#8211; as some call it &#8211; has allowed most of us to continue our education for the time being, it was implemented as a response to COVID-19 and may not be a permanent change.      The relative accessibility of computers and Wi-Fi these days made the sudden transition to Zoom classes possible.  This reality, however, is a recent phenomenon.  According to a Daily Bruin  article  from 1984, the ASUCLA Board of Control Budget Committee had to allot $5,600 to purchase a single computer that would carry out simple functions such as word processing and fiscal management.   While computers are much more affordable and versatile   today than they were in the '80s, not all students have  equal access  to the technology needed for online classes.  Fortunately, UCLA&#8217;s Campus Library Instructional Computing Commons provides laptops, iPads and internet hotspots for  long-term lending .   In addition, the  Bruin Tech Award , which was created in the wake of the COVID-19 campus shutdown, provides funding for students who don't have access to computers and decent Wi-Fi   needed for remote learning.      Acquiring access to technology can be a concern in and of itself, but adapting to technological changes in our education can be challenging as well.     Recognizing this same challenge, UCLA held a 10-day computer literacy seminar back in 1985 to update faculty and administrators on the latest advances in computer science, as well as to train them to operate specific types of computer equipment.  This seminar met for eight hours a day and was aimed specifically toward faculty members in the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science.   Similarly, UCLA prepared a series of  remote workshops  in 2020   to guide faculty in the transition to online teaching and learning as the school shut down due to COVID-19.  The workshops offer guidance in instructional planning, using CCLE and Zoom and facilitating remote discussion sessions. In addition, the Office of Information Technology at UCLA offers 24/7 access to online  educational tools  to help faculty, staff and students improve their computer literacy and take full advantage of various resources offered through UCLA.   If the past is any indication, our relationship with technology may likely continue to be defined by a coexistence of wonder and annoyance.  As we continue to navigate these changes, it might be helpful to remember that,   no, we can't cry on a computer's shoulder, but at least technology helps Bruins continue to learn and   to   be there for one another in these unprecedented times   &#8211;   just   as they have in the past.

She wrote the constitution for the International Student Representative office, implementing meticulous legislation to ensure the responsible service of the international student community on campus. She carried the office through its first year, creating sustainable institutions as she went and fostering a community through administrative avenues and student organizations alike.&nbsp;    Not only did she take the initiative to build the foundations for an entire office, she also campaigned for platforms that were strong from the start. Tariq planned to create international-themed events on campus, create more conversation spaces, establish the offices new social media presence, help international students access academic and postgrad opportunities and connect with administration and advocacy groups.&nbsp;    And she delivered. Her office hosted the first Spring Culture Day, held a town hall with over 90 students in attendance, created social media pages and a website, hosted an alumni panel focused on the job market for international students, and worked extensively with the Dashew Center, looping them into town halls and collaborating with them during International Education Week.&nbsp;    Suffice it to say, she fulfilled her platforms and then some  and the boards rating in this case is not a reflection of Tariqs incomplete platforms. Rather, it is based on her own acknowledgment that the burgeoning nature of the office means there is more work to be done to finalize and continue those platforms.&nbsp;    Regardless, Tariq helped create the office from the ground up, all while fulfilling the responsibilities she wrote into the constitution. The accountability measures are there as well  the constitution stipulates the requirement of town halls and collaboration with the Dashew Center, among other things.&nbsp;    One last impressive push from Tariq has been her offices response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Like most other USAC officers, she has reallocated the surplus funding from spring quarter toward the COVID-19 relief fund.&nbsp;    Unlike other officers, however, she hasnt used that as an excuse to stop working for her community. She advocated for more flexibility in class scheduling for students in different time zones, ensured her office was reaching out personally to students who had attended their events in the past and is working to get a virtual town hall up and running.    Shahamah Tariq came into this position without even a functioning office to show for it. Shes leaving it with a huge amount of knowledge, a strong infrastructure and a wealth of student connections.&nbsp;    And USAC is one step closer to UCLAs international community because of it.

Experts in labor studies, urban planning and law said ending DACA, the program that defers deportation for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as minors, will have adverse effects on DACA recipients, immigrant communities and on society as a whole.  Blake Emerson, a law professor, said he thinks to rescind DACA will have negative effects on current DACA recipients. He added the Supreme Court may try to craft a remedy for Dreamers by creating or strongly suggesting some new ground rules for how to terminate the program. Dreamers are individuals who arrived in the U.S. as minors and are undocumented.  &#8220;It's clear that even many of the conservative judges are sympathetic to people who are DACA recipients,&#8221; Emerson said. &#8220;Even if the court decides that it was okay for the (Donald) Trump administration to take the program away, I think there's going to be some interest in finding a way to wind down the program in a way that is not maximally disruptive.&#8221;  A repeal of DACA would limit educational opportunities, said Amjad Khan, a law professor. Although some states, including California, would still grant in-state tuition benefits for undocumented students, Khan said rescinding DACA would cause recipients to lose eligibility for federal financial aid.  &#8220;I think that students are already in a real bind because of the anxiety looming over this decision,&#8221; Khan said. &#8220;If it turns out that DACA is ended, then they will have to face deportation,wr ... and then students will have to face that very difficult choice of what they do. Do they disrupt their schooling (and) do they actually leave?&#8221;   Amada Armenta, an urban planning professor, said without DACA, UCLA would lose many students who have become integral parts of the campus community. She added the university should make sure all students are safe and are able to complete their studies.   Repealing DACA would strip work authorization for DACA recipients, said Kent Wong, who is the director of the UCLA Labor Center and a labor studies and Asian American studies professor. It would have a negative economic consequence as thousands of DACA recipients are essential workers, he said.  &#8220;Now that (DACA recipients) can legally work, it has allowed them to use their skills to benefit society as a whole, as well as to secure economic benefits for themselves and for their families,&#8221; he said.  Leticia Bustamante, a project coordinator for the Dream Resource Center, which aims to create opportunities and create a community for immigrant youth, said she thinks the university should create more opportunities to help undocumented students.  &#8220;Making sure that you make opportunities available to everybody regardless of status would probably be the best way for the university to address something like this,&#8221; Bustamante said.  Karla Martinez, a DACA recipient and fourth-year political science student said DACA has allowed her to access many on-campus opportunities.   Martinez said DACA has allowed her to conduct research and leadership positions at school. She added that because of DACA&#8217;s work authorization, she has been able to become financially independent.   President Trump tried to end DACA in September 2017, but the decision was faced with lawsuits claiming the administration did not provide an adequate reason to end the program.  The University of California was one of the plaintiffs to  issue a lawsuit  stating that the Trump administration did not provide a valid reason for termination.  The Supreme Court will release its decision by the end of June on whether it will review the decision to end DACA and whether the Trump administration&#8217;s termination of the program was legal and valid.   Khan said he does not think the Supreme Court will uphold DACA. However, he said even if the Supreme Court rescinds DACA, there will still need to be discussions about the future of current DACA recipients.  &#8220;Even if the Supreme Court decision gets passed, it certainly doesn't end the debate around DACA and what to do,&#8221; Khan said. &#8220;There's a lot of human toll that will be inflicted if DACA ends because it's been around for so long.&#8221;  Martinez added she is concerned about the future, especially about her job prospects after graduation. She said she is worried about the Supreme Court decision concerning DACA, which can affect whether she will be able to use her UCLA degree to find a job.  &#8220;It&#8217;s been a very big period of uncertainty for me especially now as my undergraduate career is ending,&#8221; Martinez said.  Repealing the program would negatively affect the economy, especially in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Khan added.  Many DACA recipients are working in essential occupations, such as healthcare, and are necessary as part of the pandemic response and the economic recovery, Khan said.  The Supreme Court has officially accepted outside input about the thousands of DACA recipients who are healthcare workers, suggesting that this pandemic is something that will be factored in the court&#8217;s final decision, Khan added.  Bustamante added the pandemic highlights existing issues. She said many people have told her that they want their lives to return to normal.  &#8220;Normal wasn't good for a lot of people; normal doesn't mean that folks weren't struggling,&#8221; Bustamante said. &#8220;So, the pandemic just shines a light on the systematic issues that we as undocumented folks, that we as immigrant folks, already knew existed.&#8221; ",['cap-kalysa-to'],"['news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/dacaanalysisillo-1024x733.jpg

That being said, she made the most of her time within CEC by broadening the scope of representation in its programming. Though she may not have entered the commissioner role without the lofty goals and dozens of subpoints like other USAC candidates, she was able to integrate diversity and entertainment successfully for the benefit of the student body.  Steinmetz is a graduating fourth-year who is majoring in global studies. She has had extensive experience in marketing and entertainment, making her as well-suited for the role as one could be. That experience pays off  she doubled CECs media following during her tenure to reach more students on campus.  After having worked in the CEC office as the print marketing designer and print marketing director, she had developed tight bonds with her internal team to make CEC a well-oiled machine by the time she became commissioner.  And with a budget of over $300,000 to oversee, she ensured that money didnt go to waste.  Students had been asking for more representation and diversity in Campus Events programming, and she listened. Films like The Farewell and Just Mercy were some of years biggest hits, in which conversations on race were navigated and brought to campus. Steinmetz especially honed in on programming central to empowering women, inviting Crazy Ex-Girlfriend star Rachel Bloom and writer and professor Laurie Mintz to discuss female sexuality.  Her biggest highlights included securing Jameela Jamil, actress from The Good Place, for a moderated Q&amp;A on body positivity, and Ilana Glazer, comedian from Broad City, for a virtual Q&amp;A after campus had shut down.  Partnering with the Student Wellness Commission helped Steinmetz balance entertainment with health and body positive discussions  a partnership that was much-needed on campus, and yielded high turnout.  Though anyone might dismiss her at first glance due to her lack of platforms, Steinmetz did the best with what she had. While the closure of campus disrupted many of the events she had hoped to bring to campus, she acted quickly to secure top talent to bring students entertainment at home during isolating times.  Steinmetz didnt have to be a political figure on campus to make a difference. She has uplifted representation and diversity by navigating tough conversations on female empowerment and race through thoughtful programming, and has brought light to students lives even at home through Zoom. She laid a solid foundation for collaborating with other commissioners offices on joint events, fostering partnerships in USAC that were lacking.

At home, Eme attends her online classes while acting as a caretaker for her family, feeling lonely and worrying about her grandmothers health, all of which exacerbated her generalized anxiety disorder, said the second-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student.  Eme was diagnosed with GAD last fall, which is a condition characterized by severe and excessive anxiety.  She said her condition was especially affected by the disruptions caused by the coronavirus this quarter.  Suffering from GAD this quarter is very difficult, Eme said. My family is extra concerned for me this quarter because they know (how) easily I can let (my) anxiety overwhelm me.  In a  poll  conducted by Kaiser Family Foundation, 45% of adults surveyed reported negative impacts on their mental health as a result of worry or stress related to COVID-19.  Eme is not the only student who struggles with mental health since national  lockdown  orders were issued in March.  The pandemic has upended students everyday lives and introduced a new set of concerns, such as challenges with remote instruction and loneliness.  Many students who moved back home have had added responsibilities on top of schoolwork, which may have caused an uptick in their stress.  In addition to taking tests and attending Zoom classes, Eme babysits her siblings from the morning to the evening while her parents are at work.  Taking care of her loved ones while being a full-time student is difficult, Eme said. She stresses over studying and attending office hours while sharing domestic responsibilities with her parents, she said.  Eme also fears for her grandmothers health  elderly people are at increased risk for contracting and dying from the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Her grandmother does not live with Eme, but lives close by. Her uncle frequently updates Eme and her family about her grandmothers health, but nonetheless, her concerns remain, she said.  There have been some nights where I'd wake up frequently or have trouble sleeping because I'm constantly thinking about her well-being, Eme said.  With most socialization occurring from a 6-feet distance or over the internet, many students have attributed their waning mental health to physical isolation from friends.  Some students use social media to compensate for the vacuum of in-person interaction the pandemic created, but talking on social media is not the same as in-person interactions, Eme said.  Eme often used social media to stay in touch with people during the onset of the pandemic, but over time she lost connection with her friends, she said.  Since her only real connection is with her family, she now worries about having to start over and make new friends, Eme said.  I've lost connections with friends from school, she said. Although talking with my cousins is nice, I still feel lonely at times.  Some students also struggled with the amount of work they were given this quarter. Khoi Dinh, a second-year music performance student, said he was having trouble managing his schoolwork because his professors are assigning an overload of busywork.  Dinh also has to record his performances in place of in-person presentations, which is more time-consuming, he said. He said he often spends upward of two hours recording 20 minutes of music to perfect his recording.  Divyanshi Singh struggles to muster motivation at home to finish the quarter, especially when many of her friends ended their school year by the time she took her first round of midterms.  The finish line seems far away for me, said Singh, a first-year business economics student.  In addition, Singhs motivation plummeted with the lack of structure in online classes, she said. Singh often procrastinates watching prerecorded lectures because there is no set learning schedule, she said.  Singh managed to be on top of schoolwork at the beginning of remote instruction, but her declining motivation has led her off track, Singh said.  On campus, Eme is able to manage her pre-exam nerves, but in quarantine, this anxiety has been more difficult to control, she said.  Once, she only managed to finish a quarter of her 10-page midterm exam, Eme said.  On the very last page, while crying, I just started rambling and writing about how overwhelmed I was at the moment, she added.  When Eme feels inundated with her situation at home, she steps outside of her house, finding release through nature and doing yoga, remote therapy or drawing, she said.  Dinh lets go of his frustrations through playing Renaissance and Baroque music on his flute. For him, music is a temporary distraction from his separation from friends and loss of campus life, Dinh said.  Singh said she reminds herself she is almost finished with the quarter to overcome her decreased motivation.  Some students air their grievances on a virtual messaging room for UCLA students, creating connections with those who have also been impacted by the pandemic.  Bella Choi, a third-year linguistics and computer science student, created the Powell Library server on the messaging app Discord to emulate the experience of group studying.  Since its creation in May, the server has grown to host over 120 users.  There are various chatrooms, or channels, on the server for students to get academic help, such as Find a Study Group and Ask Questions. Channels like Study Schedule Today, in which students share their daily academic goals, encourage users to hold themselves accountable to their studies. These chatrooms allow students to mimic the feeling of studying with their friends.  However, most students use the server for a purpose other than studying, Choi said. Many use the server to vent about their frustrations in the servers most popular channel, The Chamber of Pain and Suffering.  Im not really the first person to grab a friend and start complaining about everything, even though I might like to, Choi said. But in our chamber of suffering, we can actually do that because thats what the space is for.  Part of the reason Eme is overwhelmed with life at home is the lack of space to escape to, she said.  Eme also lost access to her campus job, which used to relieve some of her financial stress, she said.  Now I don't have any of these luxuries and just try to make the best of what I have, she said.   Mental health in the face of protests against racial injustice   On top of struggling with pandemic-induced stresses, many students said they felt strained by the  events  following George Floyds death in May.  When Chelsea Jones, a political science graduate student, first heard about Floyds death, she said she felt numb but needed to suppress her pain to keep going.  You feel the pain, but you understand that this is what has been happening to us and what continues to happen to us, Jones said. My initial response was, ... You're in school, youre trying to make it, just keep going, but you reach a certain point where you have to sit with the pain of another lost life for no reason.  Many Black students face added pressure to be politically active as they juggle their schoolwork, Jones said.  If it's not already traumatizing enough (just) seeing these images, but to (also) then go to class the next day and act as if they're not playing in your mind and then write papers on totally different topics as if the world is in normal order, Jones said.  Taylor Vassar, a first-year statistics student who attended a protest in her city, said she smelled the embers of fires outside her house on the night of the demonstration.  She said anti-Black Lives Matter rioters took over the peaceful protest and burnt her local grocery stores and banks to the ground. Vassar said as she watched rioters on the news just a mile away from her residence, she felt like she was in the midst of an apocalypse.  Every siren, loud noise from outside or sudden movement sent my heart rate skyrocketing,"" Vassar said. ""It was such a weird feeling since my body could become lazy, but my mind couldnt.  Although students might feel pressured to constantly stay tuned in to social media or the news, it is important to take a moment away to refuel, Jones said.  Jones makes a point to limit her screen time. If she is not actively engaging with the content, she begins to be negatively affected by what she sees, she said.  Black students, ... and all students honestly, have to be very protective of what they allow in their mind, Jones said. If you don't take care of yourself, you can't fight the fight anyway. You can't fight with an empty body or ... weak body.","['cap-kaitlin-browne', 'cap-megan-mccallister']","['news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/news.gradissuecoronamentalhealth.jpg

Schools across the globe have shut their doors, fragmenting communities into singular pieces here, there and everywhere. Columnist Kennedy Hill tracks student artists across the globe, recounting the ways each person maintains artistic inspiration while adhering to the new normal.   COVID-19 has rendered both China and Westwood unrecognizable, straining students' connection to community and art in the process.  Maggie Hu, a third-year sociology and art student, said the timeline between normal life in Westwood and quarantine felt instantaneous. Even though her parents in Hangzhou, China, had already been self-isolating for three weeks, Westwood was still very relaxed. But after UCLA enacted preventative measures, she said her friends rapidly dispersed and she returned to Hangzhou to be with family.  ""It definitely hit very hard and quick,"" Hu said. ""One minute everyone was still getting together (to) go hang out, and the next minute everyone kind of just left within the week.""   [Related:    Illustrations provide medium for graduating students to commemorate college   ]   Like Maggie Hu, third-year Spanish, community and culture student Xinyi Hu arrived in China just days before California instituted shelter-in-place order amid the rise of COVID-19 cases. Xinyi Hu said she worries about her friends' safety since the United States is experiencing mass infection just as China is retreating from it. While there has been  international speculation  on the accuracy of China's reported numbers, Xinyi Hu said her city seems to be improving. For instance, Hangzhou has reopened dine-in restaurants and shops, and dropped mask requirements, Maggie Hu said.  Yet even though Chinese life has gotten back on track, both Maggie Hu and Xinyi Hu still find themselves thousands of miles from their friends and Bruin community. Xinyi Hu said the 15-hour time difference between China and California makes it difficult to socialize with schoolmates since Zoom parties are scheduled in the middle of the night for her. However, she is able to arrange one-on-one chats with friends to check in on everyone stateside.  ""I'm worried about my friends in the U.S. right now,"" Xinyi   Hu said. ""I know they're all going to be okay, but it's getting worse over there.""  The time difference also poses a complication for online learning, as all UCLA classes are scheduled in PST. Maggie Hu said most of her classes allow her to watch recorded lectures, but one class requires her to wake up at 3 a.m. for discussion. Maggie Hu said she also finds it difficult to pin down due dates and assignment materials   [Related:    Transition to online class poses unique challenges for TFT students, instructors   ]   But when her laptop is closed, Maggie Hu spends her time painting, sculpting or learning to knit. COVID-19 has given her the opportunity to explore other art forms, as she still spends most of her time indoors, despite China's pandemic progress. Because of their collaborative and outdoor components, Maggie Hu has halted her practice of film and photography, but she said isolation has also given her more time to pick up new hobbies like cross-stitching.  ""It has given me more time, (but) less inspiration,"" Maggie Hu said. ""I get most of my inspiration from interacting with people, but right now I feel like I'm trying to come up with something instead of (it) hitting me.""  While isolation has hindered Maggie Hu's inspiration,   second-year dance student Tanya Xu said isolation encouraged her to explore forms of digital dance and practice fundamentals. Despite the concern of her parents, who were quarantined in Shenzhen, China, Xu decided to stay in Westwood. Without the temptation to compare her body or abilities to those of other dancers, Xu said online learning made her pay more attention to her own technique.  Even though Maggie Hu may not share Xu's enthusiasm for art in isolation, she said she continues the effort to participate in her artistic clubs .  Maggie Hu, as an executive member of The Film and Photography Society, helped create photo prompts and video challenges for club members in quarantine. Xinyi Hu also remains connected in her extracurriculars, subscribing to club newsletters for updates on how she can actively participate while abroad, she said. While abroad, it takes effort to stay involved, but Xinyi Hu said the maintenance of community is worth the trouble.  Im still hearing back from a lot of clubs (and departments) on campus,"" Xinyi Hu said. ""It felt good like Im still connected.""",['cap-kennedy-hill'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/received_214243869994457-768x1024.jpeg

Alfred, a local coffee shop with 10 locations across Los Angeles, has reopened its doors for contactless pick-up and created a delivery subscription program for its coffee beans and matcha tea tins.   Customers can decide how many bags they want delivered on either a one, two or four week basis.   Alfred also created a fundraising campaign to support UCLA Healths COVID-19 Coronavirus Patient Care Fund, in which the business will donate 100% of the proceeds made from its ""I'm a Friend of Alfred"" hoodies. The company's business development manager, Natalie Swain, said despite an initial push to only offer subscription-based coffee, the company added matcha to meet the markets demand for slightly less caffeinated drinks.  My hypothesis is that I think people do not want to be as caffeinated at home, Swain said. Maybe they might want to have some caffeine, but they don't need that crazy boost.   [Related:    Class on coffee blends in chemical engineering concepts   ]   The production of Alfred's app and subscription program aligned with the start of Californias stay-at-home orders, and Swain said the business launched its mobile app within a week of its stores closing to streamline customer experience. The app allows customers to order food or drinks ahead of time and pick it up at the store, with Alfreds locations rearranging its patios to only serve customers outside. Swain said the app is an effort to adjust to the new normal as people are slowly getting some of their pre-pandemic lives back    starting with coffee.  Additionally, Swain said the company now has a subscription program for its drip coffee, espresso coffee and matcha tins. She said that the subscription service    paired with Alfreds increased social media presence    allows customers to bring the brick and mortar Alfred experience into their homes. Instead of focusing on the trendy aesthetic of the stores, Swain said the social media team began posting tutorials for its matcha and cold brews, making their drinks accessible from anywhere.  (Our social media strategy) flipped the script, Swain said. We wanted to share with our customers what they could experience at the store, and now we are trying to help them experience Alfred at home.  Despite missing the interactions fostered in Alfreds shops, brand director Michelle Zad said the company engages with customers through social media to keep the same energy alive. She said   new coffee blends, such as the Chagaccino Blend, are now   online, and customers are encouraged to share pictures of their drinks on social media.   [Related:    Coffee Cultured: A taste of the LA coffee scene   ]   Alfred has also embraced social media in order to advertise its ""Im a Friend of Alfred hoodies through   Instagram stories and posts.   Being a local company, Zad said Alfred chose to donate the proceeds to UCLA Health because they wanted to give back to an organization that directly cares for patients with COVID-19 in the Los Angeles area.    We really wanted to do something because we pride ourselves on the community that we make within Alfred, Zad said. We are really happy to be able to help and do something for our community, and give back during these hard times.  Adapting to the pandemic, Jordan Hardin, Alfreds food and beverage director, said the company originally closed its cafes for two weeks, but still paid its employees during that time. Alfreds stores reopened as an essential business with new signage outlining their new policies that all employees are required to wear face coverings and gloves,   customers must wear masks and practice social distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from one another, Hardin said.  Additionally, Hardin said the company switched back to flat lids with a straw slot to minimize any extra contact with the beverage. He said he is expecting customers to be more conscious of the cleanliness of their cafes, so the company will continue its increased sanitizing regulations post-pandemic.  We have very high volume cafes, Hardin said. ""I think the carryover will be cleaning high-use and high-risk areas much more frequently.  Unsure of when Alfred will be allowed to fully reopen, Swain said the staff has been focusing on the constantly changing present situation. She said the smaller size of the company allows it to stay proactive and adapt as its design team makes new signage as cheerful as possible while still carrying important information. With positive reception from customers, Swain said Alfred is ready to provide coffee again      despite the circumstances.  A lot of those daily rituals we have have been more or less put on hold, Swain said. When coffee was put back on the table, people really gravitated toward that opportunity.",['cap-yasmin-madjidi'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.alfred.LMan_.jpg

On May 26, a day after the California Department of Public Health released statewide guidelines for reopening houses of worship, LA County officials amended its stay-at-home orders to immediately allow faith-based institutions to resume services with 25% of their building capacity, up to a maximum of 100 people.  In accordance with these lifted restrictions, some places of worship reopened to the public Sunday. The CDPH and county public health department will assess the impact of reopening religious institutions June 14.  Some houses of worship will voluntarily remain closed and continue to offer virtual services, including Pacific Crossroads Church in Downtown LA and Santa Monica, which decided to proceed with caution before reinstating in-person services.  &#8220;We want to be careful, and we want to protect our congregants,&#8221; said Esther Park, a community group coordinator at Pacific Crossroads Church. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a decision that can be made overnight; it&#8217;s going to be at least a week or two to be able to have a complete solidified answer on how we&#8217;re gonna go about further.&#8221;  Although Park said physical assembly is essential for Christians, she said she does not believe churches should reopen without following safety protocols.  Those who practice religions that require in-person gatherings experience a sense of void under the lockdown, said third-year public affairs and history student Brandon Broukhim.  &#8220;In Judaism, so much is based on shared experience and it&#8217;s not the same doing it myself,&#8221; Broukhim said. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult but I do what I can to carry on the traditions with my immediate family, like having Shabbat dinners.&#8221;  Religious groups and the Department of Justice have criticized California Gov. Gavin Newsom for his March 19 state moratorium that banned large gatherings, including religious services, during Stage 2 of his reopening plan.  In protest, more than 1,000 pastors declared May 21 that they would resume in-person services May 31 with or without Newsom&#8217;s permission. Although several courts sided with Newsom&#8217;s order, the governor authorized houses of worship to reopen beginning May 25.  Limited capacity in-person religious services were originally listed among prohibited &#8220;high-risk&#8221; activities, along with live audience sports, nightclubs and libraries. As of last week, the county&#8217;s  amended health order  excluded such services from that list.  Following the phased-in approach put forth by the state, the next step for LA County would have been to reopen dine-in restaurants and schools with modifications. Instead, officials skipped a step and reopened houses of worship first, which were scheduled to reopen during Stage 3 of California&#8217;s recovery roadmap.  The state approved LA County&#8217;s variance form May 28, which allowed LA to roll back its stay-at-home order.  &#8220;Our positivity rate is down, we&#8217;ve increased our capacity to do contact tracing, ... the hospital capacity remains very strong,&#8221; said Barbara Ferrer, director of the LA County Department of Public Health, during an LA County press briefing May 27. &#8220;We feel confident ... that we can in fact move forward on a recovery journey aligned with the state.&#8221;  The World Health Organization has warned countries not to preemptively infer that the flattening or dropping of the curve will continue its projected course.  &#8220;We need to be also cognizant of the fact that the disease can jump up at any time,&#8221; said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, at a press briefing May 25. &#8220;We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now that it&#8217;s going to keep going down, and that we&#8217;re going to get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.""

Two years after sweeping three awards at Spring Sing as a duet with   Hayden Everett, the third-year theater student with an emphasis on musical theater is ready to perform once again. This time, however, she will be telling her own story about being in the world as a soloist, she said.  ""Ive really become enamored with being alive,"" Pernick said. ""Knowing that I have the ability to put that into words and share that in my own way, ... when I started writing more and seeing how much I had to say and how easily it came to me, I wanted the chance to do Spring Sing on my own.""  With songs reminiscent of Sara Bareilles and Joni Mitchell, Pernick said she weaves in a folk-influenced accompaniment through the piano and guitar paired with lyrical storytelling throughout her work. Pernick has been singing since she was young, but said her focus on storytelling stems from working in musical theater starting from 4 years old.  Since she started experimenting with songwriting in middle school with childhood friend Jack Petersen, Pernick said she     presents her lyrics from the perspective of either   real or imagined characters  . And instead of following a classic pop song formula to songwriting, Pernick said she tries to create little puzzles within her songs through her lyrics. For Petersen, the complex stories Pernick tells through songwriting are representative of her magic as an artist and person, he said.  ""Her music is wonderfully simple on the surface,"" Petersen said. ""Listening to her music (more), everything is so intricate and complicated, but you'd kind of never know. The way that she knows how music works is so unsuspecting, and she just has such an innate kind of depth of knowledge.""  Despite focusing on musical theater throughout high school, Pernick felt reinspired to write music after performing in Spring Sing her freshman year. Although her and Everett  now a third-year ethnomusicology student  have both been forging paths as solo musicians, they still share their music with each other. Everett said Pernick's genuine reaction to the emotions he infuses into his music makes her one of his favorite people to show his original songs to.   Her joy parallels the joy he intends to elicit in his listeners through celebratory or happy songs, he said.  ""Shes incredibly in tune with the emotional capabilities that music has, and I think thats something that drives my musical creation  musics ability to make us feel human,"" Everett said. ""I think shes really developed her knack for creating lyrical and sonic cohesion, creating sounds and melodies that perfectly fit the lyrics.""  One such   song that Pernick said perfectly expresses herself as an artist is ""Diane,"" which she will be showcasing at Spring Sing. She said she   wrote the song in the summer, after feeling the highest of highs in performing at theater shows and meeting her closest friends while coping with the loss of her grandmother. The song    aptly named after her late grandmother    encapsulates Pernick's personal growth and reflection through both experiences, she said.  ""I think I just clicked into myself in a new way last summer,"" Pernick said. ""Through writing ('Diane'), I realized that a lot of it had to do with the sense that you are really never done growing, so you will learn the same lessons over and over and over again in your life. We have this tendency to see life as an uphill climb, but there can be so much beauty in every single moment.""  A lyric Pernick said especially stands out is ""I call myself unfinished/ But I've learned we're all unfinished and will always be even after we're gone."" She said it simultaneously conveys her continuous growth as a person and her grandmother's continued impact, whether that be in her song or through her grandmother's legacy in her own mother. To commemorate her grandmother and fulfill one of her dying wishes, Pernick also added lyrics and melodies from the song ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" at the end of ""Diane.""  Sam Pickart, one of the close friends she made during the summer she wrote the song, also feels the depth of ""Diane,"" which he said grounds him in everything from hope to heartbreak in the human experience.   He has listened to ""Diane"" several times since he first heard it, taking in the magical mix of emotions infused in every line of the song.  ""Her magic as a singer-songwriter and a person is that she knows how to capture our hearts, and I think this song is the perfect demonstration of that,"" Pickart said. ""It really has the ability to ground us and give us a little bit of hope for the future, especially in the time that were going through now.""  While she is preparing for her upcoming feature in Spring Sing and meeting with mentor Este Haim of the band HAIM, Pernick has started a GoFundMe to raise money for her first EP.   Given how much Pernick has already adapted to online concerts, however, Pickart said she already has the ability to connect with people on and off the screen.    ""She is called to be doing this, and I think she answers that call every day,"" Pickart said. ""She was taking so much of what I had felt and was never able to say in words and capturing it in under three minutes in a song. Still, to this day, it blows me away about her.""",['cap-jessica-li'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Carolinepernick-1.jpg

He wanted to do more, but because of NCAA bylaws, the rising junior UCLA football quarterback's hands were tied.  The NCAA website states ""Division I student-athletes may not promote or endorse a commercial product or service, even if they are not paid to participate in the activity"" &#8211; which typically includes fundraisers. Finances aside, Thompson-Robinson said he wanted to use his platform as a Power Five starting quarterback to incite change.  ""For somebody like me that has a lot of followers and people that look up to me and are influenced by me, I definitely think it's key for me to use my voice to promote change and promote positivity in the community,"" Thompson-Robinson said. ""I think it's a big part for me, but really, it's a big part for everyone in general.""  At the same time, he also knew money could make a lot more of a difference than 280 characters.  But as one of his contemporaries found out a few months ago, that could be a difficult goal to tackle.  When Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawerence started a coronavirus relief fund in March, it was temporarily shut down for violating the NCAA's name, image and likeness policy. After several days of confusion and miscommunication, the Tigers' compliance office sorted everything out and Lawerence was allowed to resume raising money, but the uncertainty and complicated rules had already made their mark.    [Related:    NCAA expresses support for student-athlete name, image and likeness compensation   ]   Thompson-Robinson decided to pursue a potential fundraiser anyway, and one week after expressing frustration at the NCAA, the governing body  approved his pitch . The former four-star recruit from Nevada will put 100 custom-made hoodies up for sale Wednesday at 6 p.m. for $45 apiece through his FriendsOverFans brand, with all of the proceeds going to the Las Vegas and Los Angeles chapters of 100 Black Men of America.  The 100-unit cap was self-imposed by Thompson-Robinson, who said he wanted to minimize complications with the NCAA. Selling high-profile apparel on a first-come, first-served basis comes with its own challenges, however &#8211; high demand.  ""A lot of (my teammates) have been asking to send them the link first so they can be one of those 100 people,"" Thompson-Robinson said. ""I've gotten a lot of support from the program and the people around me, really wanting to show support and rock my stuff.""   [caption caption=""(Axel Lopez/Daily Bruin senior staff)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_386022"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]       Thompson-Robinson's idea got off the ground after he approached the UCLA compliance office &#8211; specifically Associate Athletic Director of Compliance Erin Adkins &#8211; with his proposal. Because of remote instruction during spring quarter, Thompson-Robinson said he didn't run the fundraiser by his coaches like he usually would have, instead having his mom and other mentors at home vet the idea before going to the compliance office.  The compliance office was integral in making sure the fundraiser was NCAA-approved and followed its guidelines down to every last detail. But if a non-student-athlete wanted to sell hoodies for the Black Lives Matter movement, they wouldn't need any school oversight.  ""I wish I didn't have to go through (the compliance office), I wish I could just do this stuff,"" Thompson-Robinson said. ""But they make it a lot easier on us as athletes if we want to advocate for ourselves in this type of matter. I definitely think our compliance people over at UCLA does a great job with that stuff.""   While things were still being straightened out between UCLA and the NCAA, Thompson-Robinson said he researched several foundations and organizations to find which one was best for him to donate to. Thompson-Robinson hadn't had any previous hands-on volunteer experience within the Black Lives Matter movement, but he still had a few ideas in mind when making his shortlist.  ""I wanted to do one that wasn't being talked about as much, but still has a big part in the community,"" Thompson-Robinson said. ""The 100 Black Men here in Vegas does a lot for our community and the Black youth here, mentoring them. So I figured that'd be a great organization to join and be a part of and support.""   100 Black Men has been running community programs for young Black people for 57 years, centering its outreach around mentoring, education, health, wellness and economic empowerment.  Thompson-Robinson, who said he would love to set up a second fundraiser should this one go off without a hitch, has had more than just FriendsOverFans on his mind over the past week.  The quarterback was one of 30 Bruins who signed a letter demanding third-party oversight, scholarship security and more when they return to campus for voluntary workouts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thompson-Robinson was also the first to stand up for Chip Kelly when some media outlets implied the letter was a slight against the UCLA coach.   [Related:    UCLA football players demand better protections in return to training amid pandemic   ]   While Thompson-Robinson wouldn't say if he saw himself as more of a leader heading into the 2020 season, he did say he has experienced tremendous personal growth over the past few months.

A situation like this is unprecedented and has led to much discussion about the role of the Daily Bruin in informing our community, while also protecting the health and safety of our student staffers.  After initially suspending print for the first two weeks of UCLAs spring quarter, we have decided that we will not be printing for the rest of the academic year.  This was a difficult decision made by The Bruins upper management in conjunction with its Student Media advisor as well as the advertising department. The only other time the Daily Bruin  which has printed five days a week since 1925  has scaled back its production cycle was shifting to printing three days a week during World War II.   Despite the lack of a print paper, we remain committed to informing our UCLA community through daily online content, which will be displayed on our website, social media platforms and email newsletter. Now, more than ever, it is our duty to keep Bruins informed about the impacts of COVID-19 on our campus, in Westwood and throughout the greater Los Angeles area.  Since 1919, the Daily Bruin has sought to reach and inform readers in whatever way it can  and that is not something that we intend to stop doing. We cannot predict what the coronavirus outbreak will bring in the coming days, but we will do everything in our power to keep you all informed every step of the way.

Over the past three years I&#8217;ve worked as a copy editor for Daily Bruin, I&#8217;ve spent a significant amount of time double-checking 20-years&#8217; worth of sports statistics, questioning if a reader would ever really check it and issue a correction if our stat was wrong. I&#8217;ve spent time writing punny, albeit sometimes cheesy, headlines, hoping readers would enjoy the wordplay I used. And I&#8217;ve spent more time than I can count staying in the office until 3 a.m. to ensure stories are accurate, consistent and well-worded.  While I&#8217;ve often questioned if anyone notices the work we do in Copy, the reality may be that readers aren&#8217;t really supposed to.  This is a sentiment a copy editor at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch shared, writing  on Twitter : &#8220;When we do our job right, what we do is barely detectable.&#8221;   As copy editors, it is our goal to ensure the reader doesn&#8217;t notice any mistakes and disrupt their reading experience by pausing at something and questioning if it&#8217;s correct.  On the flip side of that coin is that your job can be very visible when you miss a mistake &#8211; when you gloss over a misspelled word, or, even worse, cause one or find out that fact you spent all that time checking was, in fact, not correct.  When your job is to make sure a story is mistake-free, it can feel like you&#8217;ve failed when a story gets a correction.  I&#8217;ve never really been one to take failure in stride, often opting not to do something out of fear of failure rather than trying and failing. In fact, my fear of failure was one of the reasons I didn&#8217;t apply to Daily Bruin during my first year.  Even after three years, I&#8217;ve still chided myself for the times I missed those mistakes, mulling over what went wrong for days after the fact, regretting not looking over the story just one more time.  In all honesty, over time, it hasn&#8217;t gotten any easier seeing there&#8217;s a correction on a story I edited. But whether I like it or not, copy editing for the Daily Bruin has forced me to acknowledge those mistakes, to hold myself accountable for them and to do my best to learn from them and then move on.  Most of all, though, I&#8217;ve learned that it can be OK to laugh at those mistakes sometimes too.  The people I have had the opportunity to work alongside have taught me that it&#8217;s not the end of the world when you make a mistake, and sometimes it&#8217;s OK to laugh when you realize you didn&#8217;t double-check to make sure the filler text was replaced with the caption you asked for and find out the filler text printed and was made into a meme.  I often say one of the best parts of working for the Daily Bruin is the people, and, amid breaking stories that seem to crop up out of the blue and unexpected problems with the PDF we sent to the printer, that&#8217;s something that has stayed constant over the years.  For every time I&#8217;ve spent staying up until 2 a.m. parsing through science articles and working to ensure we&#8217;re being sensitive about the topics we write about, I&#8217;ve also spent time eating candy with other editors, laughing until my stomach hurt and singing along to &#8220;Mamma Mia&#8221; and Taylor Swift.  During my first year at UCLA, I was overcome with loneliness, often questioning if I should have gone to a smaller school where it was easier to meet people or where I knew more people. I&#8217;m from a small state and went to a school where I took classes with the same groups of people since the sixth grade, so I was overwhelmed coming to a large university where there were hundreds of people in my classes and hundreds of organizations I could join. But joining Daily Bruin made what felt like the large and intimidating world of UCLA feel much smaller and much more like a home.   To Saskia, thank you for entrusting me with being your assistant Copy chief. It has been a hectic year, and I&#8217;ve frequently questioned myself and whether I was capable of dealing with the stress, but I could not have done any of it without you. To Callista, thank you for being one of my first friends in Daily Bruin and for being by my side to laugh and weather the chaotic late nights. And to the copy editors I have worked with over the past three years, seeing your dedication to ensuring the credibility of this newspaper and working beside you has pushed me to become a better editor &#8211; and for that, I thank you.  In the long run, even if the work of a copy editor may not be marked with a byline or a note saying what we edited, and even if it may be largely invisible to readers, the time and effort we put into editing stories is not.

In January, Kaplan Test Prep reported 36% of college admissions officers  view  applicants&#8217; social media profiles, an 11% bump from last year.  As if it wasn't hard enough for applicants to get into college before universities added cyberstalking to the admissions process.   UCLA is the most-applied-to university in the country, with more than 135,000 applicants in 2019. But in fall 2019, UCLA  had an admission rate of approximately 14%. And last year, the university  planned  to cap enrollment rates in order to fix overcrowding.  And UCLA Undergraduate Admission doesn't look at social media, so many qualified students are already being turned away without the use of social media in admission.   Using social media accounts to assess a borderline student&#8217;s compatibility with a university is not only time-consuming, entirely subjective and not indicative of potential collegiate success, but also reflects an affinity for &#8220;cancel culture&#8221;   that an influential university like UCLA should not support.  When evaluating a student&#8217;s application, colleges need to determine if a student and a university are a good fit for one another.   Gary Clark, director of UCLA Undergraduate Admission, said in an emailed statement that gauging a student&#8217;s potential success on campus is paramount to the admissions process.  &#8220;Our goal is to determine if we feel the student is a good fit for UCLA, meaning is the student able to both benefit from and contribute to UCLA in and outside of the classroom,&#8221; Clark said in the statement.   The university does not look at social media profiles to assess students' applications and instead strictly adheres to the 14  criteria  stipulated by the University of California, according to an emailed statement from UCLA Undergraduate Admission.  And while this method of admissions hasn't been adopted yet, an increasingly digital world makes it difficult to know what policy the university will implement in the future.  It&#8217;s hard to determine a student&#8217;s ability to succeed from their social media profiles, as these profiles are often used to push a public persona rather than to reflect real life. A 2019 poll conducted by YouGov  found  that 41% of social media users in Britain claimed to have seen inaccurate content during a 30-day period.  As such, reviewing profiles would quickly become a waste of time for admissions departments.   &#8220;People use social media to reflect the recreation they engage in,&#8221; said Jason Mally, a fifth-year cognitive science and computer science student. &#8220;Besides LinkedIn, social media sites are not professional resumes.&#8221;  The content presented on each platform is different &#8211; not every post on Twitter is reflective of someone&#8217;s professional persona, nor is it indicative of their potential success as a student.   Inappropriate or even downright offensive posts are most likely what admissions officers are looking for.  But it&#8217;s hard to tell what admissions officers would consider when assessing social media accounts, and arbitrary decisions could set dangerous precedents. One positive social media post could propel an applicant over the edge, while one negative post could irreparably change their future.   Applying for college is a stressful time, and any fair advantage a student can get in the process, they will take.  &#8220;I had friends in high school who thought universities might check their social media, so they went through and deleted whatever they thought put their chances at risk,&#8221; Mally said.  While this may just be pictures of partying or skipping class, it could also include purging social media of any controversial subject matter, like posts about political or other personal beliefs. Admissions directors are still people who have biases, so there&#8217;s no reason to risk potentially offending them.  But these biases can play right into the cancel culture narrative &#8211; the act of boycotting an individual because of comments they&#8217;ve made or actions they&#8217;ve taken.  Some students have left school or been officially dismissed   for posting racist content while in  colleg  e.  And unlike high schoolers posting about skipping sixth period, these students are older and their punishments are warranted.   High schoolers are still learning and should be afforded opportunities to make and learn from their mistakes, and their future educational opportunities shouldn't be hindered by immature choices.  And there&#8217;s no one more immature than   a high-schooler on Instagram.  &#8220;You&#8217;re young when you&#8217;re 14 or 15,&#8221; said Shivani Ghate, a third-year cognitive science and economics student.  &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make (bad behavior) okay, but people grow, change and evolve. It&#8217;s hard to draw that line.&#8221;  College applicants haven't fully matured yet, and their social media reflect that. The rational part of a person's brain isn&#8217;t fully developed until 25, so it doesn&#8217;t seem fair to judge these individuals based on comments made online.  Of course, these applicants did choose to put personal content online, so some people  argue  that it&#8217;s public information. Anyone can access it, so it seems fair for college admissions officers to use it. In fact, they may be doing themselves a disservice if they don&#8217;t take all aspects of a candidate into account.  But admissions officers aren&#8217;t moral authorities who know exactly what&#8217;s acceptable for a person to post. The criteria are too subjective, and no standard besides a very general blanket ban on hateful rhetoric could feasibly be enacted.  The internet allows access to social media users' personal lives, and users need to be conscious of what they post in a more connected world.  But mistakes shouldn&#8217;t follow a person around forever, even though the internet is here to stay.

The number of students using CAPS services for the first time in at least six months has dropped 65% to 70% between finals week of winter quarter and the start of week four, said Nicole Green, executive director of CAPS.  Green said she believes the drop comes from students transitioning into their new living situations.  It makes sense to me that people have not been thinking about mental health so much, because theyve been trying to manage basic needs, Green said.  Green said that although fewer students are seeking first-time appointments with CAPS, the numbers may increase once students are able to assess their new living environment.  It takes a while to (think), Oh, this is not going well, so I think we might see an increase later in the spring and then in the summer, Green said.  The  Peer Assistance and Wellness Support program , a student-run counseling service, has also seen a significant decrease in the number of students seeking first-time counseling appointments, said Michael Leuchter, a senior counselor and medical student.  When you're off campus and there's a pandemic going on, it's a very different situation, where all of a sudden, you don't know what resources are still active, Leuchter said.  Before the switch to online instruction, PAWS was asked by some outreach groups to extend more help to engineering students, as well as preprofessional students, such as students pursuing degrees in law or medicine.  The uncertainty that usually accompanies a high-competition career path affects more students now than it ever has, Leuchter said .  People are worried about job prospects, Leuchter said. If they're not able to meet recruiters, or if there are hiring freezes due to COVID, things like that.  But some students are still reluctant to seek out UCLAs mental health services, in part because of an assumption that mental health services have been overwhelmed.  Shannon Burns, a graduate student in psychology, said that although her panic attacks have gotten more frequent since classes moved online, she is reluctant to make an appointment with CAPS.  I feel like ... so many other people are going to be needing it, and maybe they need it more than me, Burns said. It feels like maybe I should be getting help, but this is not a normal time. And so I don't know what the new standards are for (how) to seek help.  Although the decrease in new clients to PAWS has been dramatic, Leuchter said the program cant know how many students arent getting mental help who need it.  There are all kinds of possible reasons why someone might not reach out to us, but were always here for them when they do, Leuchter said.",['cap-susan-monaghan'],"['a-closer-look', 'campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/news.mentalhealthcorona-1.png

But amid the cancellations due to the coronavirus, the MLB announced its 2020 draft would be shortened to just five rounds, and only one Bruin  junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell  is a lock to be drafted. To find out how the shortened draft will affect college baseball in the coming years, assistant Sports editor Jared Tay sat down with UCLA baseball coach John Savage to talk about all the recent developments in the baseball world.    Daily Bruin : Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, baseball fans have known that a shortened 2020 draft was likely, and Major League Baseball officially announced earlier this month that its amateur draft would cut from its normal 40 rounds to just five. What are your reactions to the front offices decision, and what does this mean in general for college baseball?   John Savage : Youre talking about five rounds, so that really limits the entry into Major League Baseball, on the back end (of the draft). Youve got to be a top-five round pick, and if not, youre looking at free agency if youre a senior. On the front end, high school players that arent top-five round picks will be going to college. I think theres some give and take; nobody really knows how it's going to play out. But knowing that the draft is going to be 85% shorter than it was at 40 rounds, its a significant difference and (will have) a significant impact. Youre going to see more players going to college and staying in college.   DB : The MLB also announced that teams would be able to sign an unlimited number of free agents, yet those players would only be allowed to sign for a maximum contract of $20,000. Does the limit make leaving school as a free agent especially unappealing for undrafted players in your program?   JS : Yes. You hit it right on. (Twenty thousand dollars) is not an appealing number. The only time it's really appealing is if youre a senior and youve played here for four years and youre finished academically. You could sign from anywhere between $1,000 and $20,000, but you dont have a lot of leverage. As a junior, you would still have two years of collegiate eligibility, so it doesnt make a lot of sense for our juniors to sign for $20,000.   [Related:    Tay's Takedown: Shortening of MLB Draft could deny collegiate players chance to go pro in 2020   ]    DB : With all the changes to the draft in a relatively short amount of time, have you had to help counsel your players on the decision to stay in school or start their careers?   JS : We definitely have had conversations with all the juniors, making sure they understand the rules, the process (and) the clock in terms of being a professional. There are arguments that some of them might want to start their careers, but at the same time, going into professional baseball as a free agent and as an amateur is really difficult. The only time you want to be a free agent is if youre (former UCLA pitcher) Gerrit Cole, but those are two different types of free agents. We anticipate anybody who isnt drafted as a junior to come back, but we would recommend a senior sign since theyre finished academically.   DB : As you talk about juniors returning to school, two players that come to mind are (junior right-handers) Zach (Pettway) and Holden (Powell). Has the process for them been even more difficult, especially since they would likely be drafted in the later rounds of a 40-round draft?   JS : Again, youre right on. We anticipate Mitchell going in the first round. We believe (Powell) has a good chance of going somewhere between the third and fifth rounds. We're going to need to sit through June 10 and 11 to really see how it's going to play out for both (Powell and Pettway). They are definitely two guys that are looking at different options and possibly different teams, having Zoom meetings with professional clubs, just trying to get a pulse on where they might fit. If they dont get drafted, I think they would both be open to coming back.   DB : Looking at your roster as a whole after the summer, youll potentially have more first-year players, as well as guys who have chosen to remain in school. Are you concerned about roster spots, playing time and competition over scholarships, among other things?   JS : Yeah, thats a good point. We are concerned with how the NCAA will rule on roster limits. The 27-player max that can be on scholarship, theyre talking about moving that up to 32. The 25% (scholarship) rule, how is that affected and could that be going away? (Meanwhile), the MLB has come out of nowhere with a five-round draft  its a time weve never seen before. Theres a lot of factors that normally we dont deal with, and we have to deal with it remotely, which is even more of a challenge. Days are crazy right now just trying to figure it all out.   DB : Is it comforting, though, to know that youre not the only Division I program that is going to have these challenges in the years ahead?   JS : I think the one thing about UCLA that makes it different, is our clocks. ... Our program is a progressive program where our really good juniors normally sign and our seniors play four years and then graduate. The big monster in the room is the five-round draft. That has a major impact on the world of college baseball, and youre right, everyone is dealing with it, but I think the higher-profile programs are dealing with it a little bit more. Thats where I think were different than most. We have a lot of high-end juniors and we have a lot of high-end incoming guys. With the five rounds, the uncertainty is at an all-time high.   DB : Looking at UCLAs recruiting  not for the incoming class but for the next few years  does your strategy need to change when it's unclear whether a 40-round draft will return in the near future?   JS : Yeah, its a good question. Theyre talking about the 2021 draft being 20 rounds. Its not etched in stone, but it'll be more than five rounds. It has an impact on the 21 class and 22 class. Right now, Im looking at the 21 (through) 24 roster and it changes depending on drafts, guys signing with free agency, and you really have to have organization and intel with the MLB. The signing deadline is Aug. 1, which doesnt really help. It starts to get close to fall quarter, and usually, the signing deadline is before that. It will have an impact on future classes, just because of numbers, and I feel like I need an accountant right now.   DB : Shifting gears, there hasnt been an official announcement from the Pac-12 just yet, but there are rumors of the potential for a Pac-12 baseball tournament right before the NCAA tournament starting in 2021. The ACC and SEC already decide their champions via a bracket-style competition, so what are your thoughts on the move for a postseason conference tournament?   JS : Well, Ive never been a proponent of a tournament. I believe in 30 nine-inning games to decide a champion, but I think our league felt that we were getting short-changed in the selection process for the (NCAA tournament). People thought it was a potential try to see if we could get another team into the tournament. I dont know if this will help it. They havent announced anything official, but somehow it got leaked to the press, (so) well see how it plays out. Im not a huge fan of a team finishing eighth place winning the tournament and then getting an automatic bid to the (NCAA tournament). It just hasnt been in my DNA, but I guess well have to adjust.",['cap-jared-tay'],"['baseball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.sp_.Savage.QA_.AB_.jpg

As of now, the timeline for productions and premieres to start again is  shrouded in uncertainty , complicated by social distancing protocols and  concerns regarding safety on set . Meanwhile, industry professionals are trying to adjust to a new workflow at home, from holding Zoom writers' rooms to launching their own streaming sites. But alumnus Silas Howard, who directed on the Emmy-nominated series ""Pose,"" said the negative impacts of quarantine should not be understated for a large population of workers in the entertainment industry.  &#8220;People's careers are just being put on hold or getting their momentum just swept away,&#8221; Howard said. &#8220;That can be very devastating in terms of the years it takes for people to bring their stories out into the world.&#8221;   [Related:    Transition to online class poses unique challenges for TFT students, instructors   ]   As added context, he said he was anticipating a busy year with many directorial positions underway, but now most of his upcoming productions and location shoots had to be canceled or postponed. To compensate for the lost time, Howard said he&#8217;s been keeping busy by remotely working on screenplays and continuing to meet with executives digitally to raise funds for future projects.  In addition to reorganizing his workflow, he said he is also taking the time to introspectively evaluate his priorities. Having lived through the HIV/AIDS pandemic, Howard said the coronavirus evokes a similar sense of awareness in the affected communities, who learned to value their lives and the limited time they have to act on matters they care about. There is a sense of greater urgency now for storytellers &#8211; especially from marginalized groups &#8211; to make their voices be heard or else fall off the map, Howard said.  &#8220;Taking risks is a really amazing part of storytelling, but we live in a very risk-averse society,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you think of the amount of time we have to do the things we care about, we have to prioritize the stories and the voices of (people) who haven't been heard before.&#8221;  [caption caption=""The stay-at-home orders are an equalizer for Hollywood, Howard said.

As part of the Directors Guild of America, he said the institution helps members file for unemployment, which is not a benefit that is granted for all independent contractors.  He said individuals who are not unionized were facing sporadic work before quarantine and are now even more vulnerable to the financial burden imposed by the forced shutdown of productions. Alumna Noga Landau said there is also no definitive work loss compensation &#8211; which depends on a variety of factors such as the production company and its budget &#8211; for independent contractors and crew members across the board.  As a writer for The CW's &#8220;Nancy Drew,&#8221; however, Landau said she has fared relatively well given the circumstances. The writers&#8217; room has been transposed completely to Zoom, and she said they&#8217;ve been meeting during regular work hours every day with few hiccups. Despite having to finish the first season prematurely, Landau said they were able to provide an organic ending rather than forcing it, which may not be the case for other television series.   [Related:    Theater students improvise virtual methods to replace in-person productions   ]   But Landau said there is only so much content they can portion out beyond what was filmed prior to the lockdown. There have been hopeful talks of starting production in the summer to bridge the content gap, but this timeline is susceptible to changes and delays depending on how the pandemic plays out and what the industry&#8217;s response is, she said.  &#8220;A lot of people are going to have to figure out how to sort of pick up the pieces of what they were working on when the pandemic hit and production ground to a halt,&#8221; Landau said. &#8220;Crews may be switched around, and I think it'll probably take a lot of flexibility (and) ingenuity.&#8221;  Heather Mar&#237;a &#193;cs, an independent filmmaker and one of Howard&#8217;s longtime collaborators, said there is a silver lining for content creators even during the pandemic. She said the diversity of content being published by drag queens and performers of all kinds demonstrates the artists' resourcefulness and vitality. Inspired by online performances, she said she is starting her own &#8220;queerantine&#8221; streaming site to specifically showcase LGBTQ+ films and shorts, using the creative freedom of the internet to promote the voices in her community.

Although the pandemic has directly affected her job because of its hands-on nature, she said one potential upside now that the industry is facing increased safety concerns is that jobs such as hers may be reevaluated as an essential part of the set.  So while the short-term consequences of the quarantine can be detrimental to casts, crews and productions, it can also serve as a long-term learning opportunity for everyone, &#193;cs said. The hope is for communication and feedback to be integrated at all levels of production in order to create a safer work environment for everyone, she said. Despite the industry&#8217;s prospects still being very much in the air, &#193;cs said the passion for their crafts will remain deeply rooted in how industry professionals are moving forward.  &#8220;Whether it's independent or mainstream industries, we're going to keep telling stories,&#8221; &#193;cs said. &#8220;And I hope that we will keep telling stories with as much respect, care and safety as possible for the cast and crew above and below the line.&#8221; ",['cap-alyson-kong'],"['arts-entertainment', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.industryeffects.JHan_.jpg

The UC Board of Regents unanimously  voted  May 21 to waive the SAT and ACT as admissions requirements, choosing to make the tests optional until their full suspension in 2024.  The UC had initially suspended the testing requirement for the fall 2021 applicant pool, but later decided to phase out the SAT and ACT altogether.  In addition to doing away with standardized assessments, the UC also announced its plans to create a new test to be used for future applicants. Even if the test isn&#8217;t ready to be administered by fall 2025, the UC will not be   returning to the SAT and ACT requirement.  Suspending the SAT and ACT in the midst of a global pandemic is   the right   decision, as many colleges are taking note of the unprecedented and difficult circumstances that coronavirus has brought to standardized testing. However, the UC now faces the daunting task of creating a new test by 2025.   If the UC is going to create a new test, it needs to commit the proper resources to ensure that it doesn't develop an assessment that highlights the same financial and educational inequities the ACT and SAT did.  If current circumstances teach us anything, it's that   present   standardized testing measures are   deeply flawed.    Currently, the SAT is  canceled  for the month of June. The College Board issued a statement announcing tentative plans to administer the test online.  However, the testing company has already faced challenges with   online testing, as high school students across the nation  reported  technical difficulties when taking their Advanced Placement exams earlier this month. The glitches in test-taking have even resulted in an online petition requesting that the College Board allow students to resubmit their AP exams rather than force them to retake the exam at a future date.  And the UC schools aren&#8217;t the only universities that have   found it necessary to adjust their admission standards in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Many other colleges, such as Amherst College, Harvard University and Cornell University, have  decided  to waive standardized testing requirements for fall 2021 applicants, citing the unprecedented circumstances of   the coronavirus.    On top of this, the College Board and ACT have   given  statements  respecting the rights of colleges to make their admission policies more flexible in the wake of the pandemic.   But as of recently, only   the UC has taken the bold step of abolishing the SAT and ACT from future applications altogether.  It&#8217;s agreeable that there should be a consistent variable to compare students that come from a variety of educational backgrounds. However, the SAT and ACT have   certainly played their parts in highlighting major disparities that exist across the nation in regard to access to a quality education.  With test preparation companies such as Kaplan and Princeton Review making  thousands  off students who are willing to pay for their programs, some have raised questions about the ability of standardized tests to accurately reflect how well students perform academically.  Jocelyn Tzeng, a second-year biology student, views the standardized tests as outdated in predicting student performance in college.  &#8220;Now college admissions are a lot more holistic and they look at a lot of other things besides your grades, and tests are limited in showing how you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; Tzeng said.  Tzeng's comments ring true, as tests have become only one component of the UC application. Aside from numbers, the application allows students to express their qualifications through sections such as essay statements and extracurriculars.  Claire Li, a second-year economics and statistics student, pointed out the tendency of SAT and ACT scores to reflect bias in favor of those from privileged socioeconomic backgrounds.    &#8220;I think standardized tests, in general, are pretty difficult (in being) truly reflective of student performance,&#8221; Li said.  For all the shortcomings of standardized testing that the SAT and ACT were quick to expose, the new UC test has a lot to make up for. This means the UC needs to dedicate the proper resources, time and oversight to     ensure its test is ready by 2025 and doesn&#8217;t further accentuate existing socioeconomic cleavages.  Jose-Felipe Martinez, an associate professor at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, said in an emailed   statement that he was worried about the serious unintended consequences of eliminating the SAT and ACT requirement.  &#8220;For me the crucial fact here is that any test we develop ... will ultimately face the harsh reality that students in California and the US are exposed to deeply inequitable educational opportunities,&#8221; Martinez said in the statement.  And it&#8217;s true. Any standardized test, whether it comes from College Board or the UC, faces the inevitable fate of falling into the hands of expensive test prep programs, which can give students from more affluent backgrounds an unfair advantage.  &#8220;We should now be very vigilant to make sure (the new test) does not ultimately result in an enormous waste of time and resources, or even worse, an unintended setback for equity,&#8221; Martinez said in the statement.  Since the UC has set its own deadline for the construction of a new test for future UC applicants, the clock is ticking to design an assessment that can both highlight what the UC is looking for and take into account underlying social inequalities.  Otherwise, it stand  s the possibility of wasting financial resources on another test that will only perpetuate the disturbing   problems of traditional standardized testing.

Following the recent killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd, supporters and allies of the Black Lives Matter movement have taken to the streets to protest police brutality and systemic racial injustice. The central issues are not new &#8211; they are the foundation upon which this country was built, and the realities Black Americans have lived with for centuries.  The underpinnings of systemic racism has been perpetuated through structures including modern policing, mass incarceration and disenfranchisement. As these protests sweep across the country &#8211; and the world &#8211; they&#8217;ve been met with an outpouring of activism as many white and non-Black people of color are confronting the realities of racism that they&#8217;ve ignored or minimized.  For those new to advocacy, it may be easy to slip into performative activism &#8211; activism rooted in optics, perception and projecting an image of support   &#8211; but such half measures are not enough.   Empty words and photos of black boxes and borders on Facebook profile pictures are not enough. Silence is not an option and neither is an empty display of pseudo-solidarity. In order to move toward lasting justice and meaningful systemic changes, activism must be more than performative.   [Related:    Editorial: UCLA&#8217;s deafening silence on Black Lives Matter movement sanctions complicity, hurts Bruins   ]        Activism is fundamentally multifaceted, particularly in a global pandemic &#8211; those unable to join physical protests can still take worthwhile action. There are multiple avenues for activism, including utilizing social media visibility to call for action, donating, fundraising, signing petitions, contacting lawmakers and politicians to enact legal change, having difficult conversations with loved ones and educating yourself.   There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all approach to activism &#8211; exemplified best by K-pop fans who flooded police surveillance apps and racist hashtags with fancams of their favorite artists.  Many methods of activism have been centered on social media, which can be a massively democratizing force when used as a tool for advocacy. Social media has been used to disseminate vital information about the protests that is often left out of mainstream media, as well as educational resources and links to fundraising efforts. However, social media can also be a safety blanket &#8211; a way for people to do the bare minimum in a   highly   visible way that assuages their feeling of guilt, making   them look like they&#8217;re on the right side of history without taking any concrete actions.  The infamous black box on #BlackoutTuesday perfectly highlights the dynamics of performative activism and offers a framework for discussion. The origins of the hashtag began   with Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, two Black women in the music industry who started an Instagram account and hashtag using the words #TheShowMustBePaused. The original intent was to propose a blackout for the music industry specifically, urging people in the industry to ""pause"" promotion and business as usual to refocus and reflect on actions to support the protests and the Black community.  From there, the idea of a blackout Tuesday took on a life of its own and became a trend &#8211; posting black squares and logging out of social media.   This ultimately flooded and replaced the vital information shared with the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag.  Though the idea began with constructive aims, the distilled version that went viral quickly   became an empty gesture. The numbers tell a disheartening story, even if it&#8217;s difficult to quantify activism. While the #BlackoutTuesday hashtag has 28 million posts on Instagram, the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on the same platform has only 21 million posts, and none of the petitions calling for justice have anywhere near that number of signatures  .  That&#8217;s not to say that people who posted a black box are bad people, or even bad activists. Instead, it demonstrates the limits of social media activism &#8211; the visibility that makes it a powerful tool also lends itself to performative virtue and compassion.   These black boxes fall short in creating      lasting change or understanding, rather demonstrating the necessity that social media activism be accompanied by action.   [Related:    An effective ally must keep their ears open, remember to be silent is to condone   ]   Celebrities and corporations were also quick to jump onto the black box bandwagon, and have worked to leverage their social media platforms for the cause with varying levels of success. Some were able to make meaningful statements, like Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s full-throated call to dismantle white supremacy that put the watered-down language of other corporate statements to shame.  Other individuals and companies weren&#8217;t quite as successful &#8211; it&#8217;s difficult to take the NFL&#8217;s statement of solidarity seriously given the fact that they failed to mention Colin Kaepernick, who was effectively silenced and barred from the league for his peaceful protest   as he knelt during the national anthem   almost four years ago. On the public stage afforded to celebrities and corporations, efforts at activism   must be substantive, and cognizant of their own history and complacency on the issues.  No matter how good the intention, the Washington Redskins are not in a position to comment on racism in America.  Ultimately, it&#8217;s difficult to know whose activism is performative or authentic in the moment. The true test will come in the months and years that follow, as people demonstrate whether the phrase ""Black lives matter"" is one of their core beliefs or whether it was just a trending hashtag and a post to be shared in the moment, only to be archived or deleted when the pressure lifts.  But worrying about how activism will be perceived in the moment is ineffective and unsustainable. It unnecessarily centers the individual rather than the cause and takes up valuable space in the conversation. Some people will get things wrong, but the aim is not to be ""right"" &#8211; it's about having the humility to learn, grow and hold yourself accountable. Racist ideology is something deeply ingrained in the fabric of our culture, and the process of decolonizing our society is a constant process of active anti-racism.     Education   may feel uncomfortable at times, but the discomfort is necessary.   Activism is a process of individual growth and constant conversation &#8211; a commitment to a lifetime of action and attention that cannot stop until justice and equality are achieved.

But when it comes to taking their own action during this pandemic, the UC regents have been noticeably quiet.  UCLA made the announcement March 10 that it would move classes online, following similar announcements from other campuses like UC San Diego. Within days, all 10 UC campuses had announced the transition to online learning.  Contrary to its long history of lackluster emergency response communication, UCLA provided remote town hall discussions, collaborated with student government and created opportunities for students to voice their concerns and preferences via MyUCLA. More than that, school officials actually listened.  Their bosses haven&#8217;t done as much.  The regents have a responsibility to make themselves available to the UC community &#8211; not despite the current situation, but because of it. Beyond addressing the effects of COVID-19, there&#8217;s a systemwide shift to virtual learning, a new UC president to hire, an ongoing graduate student strike and a proposed tuition hike still on the agenda. The impact of these changes will affect students for years to come, and it is crucial that the regents do not use the ongoing chaos to sweep them under the rug in the coming months.  It&#8217;s time the UC regents take a page from their campuses&#8217; playbooks &#8211; and that means making themselves available, transparent and open to communicating with student leaders.  The 10 campuses have done the best they can to offset this pandemic, but when the dust settles, students will be left with questions that only a systemwide entity can answer.   Individual campuses can&#8217;t make administrative decisions about the cost of online education. Nor can they make promises to their collective graduate students about cost-of-living adjustments when over 6.6 million U.S. citizens have filed for unemployment.  That&#8217;s the job of the regents &#8211; and it&#8217;s a job they&#8217;re failing to fulfill.  It&#8217;s not as though the UC lacks the resources. Backed by billions of dollars, cutting edge research and a team of highly educated individuals, it would be almost offensively easy for the regents to conduct a remote town hall. They&#8217;ve occurred in person for years, and now more than ever, these public forums could be used to facilitate discussion and provide the community &#8211; UC campus leaders, faculty, workers and students alike &#8211; with a sense of guidance during these uncertain times.  Granted, the regents have provided some information regarding COVID-19 and its implications for the UC. Those announcements have ranged from decisions to ease admissions standards to plans for using emergency federal funding. What has been missing is direct communication with the UC community that is already here. It&#8217;s a community that wants to talk, and the conversation could cost nothing more than the price of a Zoom membership.  As of now, students aren&#8217;t just hoping for a conversation with the regents &#8211; they&#8217;re owed one.  Because until they open a dialog, the University&#8217;s response will feel a lot less like the administrative decisions of a unified system, and a lot more like 10 discombobulated campuses trying their best.

UCLA awarded O&#8217;Shea &#8220;Ice Cube&#8221; Jackson &#8211; musician, actor, producer, director and CEO &#8211; the Game Changer Award at an annual conference hosted by the UCLA Anderson School of Management.  Ice Cube&#8217;s most notable tracks as a musical artist include &#8220;You Know How We Do It,&#8221; &#8220;No Vaseline&#8221; and &#8220;I Rep That West,&#8221; among other songs.  The Pulse Conference, organized by the School of Management's Center for Management of Enterprise in Media, Entertainment &amp; Sports, or MEMES, honors notable individuals in these fields with the Game Changer Award. It also draws leaders from these industries to discuss their respective trades.  The event usually brings in about 500 people every year, according to the School of Management&#8217;s website.  This year, the award was presented by Jay Tucker, executive director of MEMES.  &#8220;(Ice) Cube has changed the game because he saw possibilities that others didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Tucker said. &#8220;He changed the game because he made the world see him and his community.&#8221;  Ice Cube sat down after he received the award for a conversation with Jeff Moorad, a board member of MEMES and adjunct professor at the management school, to discuss his roots in South Central Los Angeles and his extensive career.   Ice Cube said in the early years of his career with hip-hop collective N.W.A, they thought they were going to be local artists for Southern Los Angeles. They believed major-league rappers were only from New York, he said.  &#8220;I know they don&#8217;t like me in New York, but ... they&#8217;ll like me in the neighborhood,&#8221; Ice Cube said.  Although the group focused on its home base, its music reached people outside of California&#8217;s borders.  &#8220;We just started to take off,&#8221; Ice Cube said. &#8220;We were true to ourselves, so the world recognized.&#8221;  Ice Cube also discussed his start in the movie industry, acting in Oscar-nominated film &#8220;Boyz n the Hood.&#8221;  After shooting &#8220;Boyz n the Hood,&#8221; Ice Cube started writing, directing and producing films such as &#8220;Friday,&#8221; &#8220;Ride Along&#8221; and &#8220;Straight Outta Compton.&#8221;  He said one of his favorite movies to produce was the 2005 film &#8220;Are We There Yet?&#8221; The family movie with a mostly all-black cast let him give back to his community, Ice Cube said.  &#8220;Black kids don&#8217;t get movies like that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I was happy to do that.&#8221;  Ice Cube also said he was happy to have a career doing voice-overs for entertainment and sports. He has voiced over sports documentaries, cartoons, video games and more. Some of his most well-known voiceovers include his contributions to the video game ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" and the film &#8220;The Book of Life.&#8221;  &#8220;It&#8217;s cool to be around long enough to have a recognizable voice,&#8221; Ice Cube said. &#8220;And, you know, I&#8217;m not mad about it at all.&#8221;  Ice Cube also discussed BIG3 and FIREBALL3. FIREBALL3 is the official title for a style of 3-on-3 basketball. Ice Cube co-founded both the sport and BIG3, its professional league.  Ice Cube closed the talk by saying he wishes he could set an example for people from all communities to overcome the status quo.  Several attendees of the conference said they think the Game Changer Award was well-deserved for Ice Cube.  Blake Miller, a Southern California native and UCLA graduate student, said Ice Cube has always been an icon. He added that he thinks Ice Cube deserved the award because of the constant reinvention of his career throughout his life.  &#8220;Not only is he changing the games he&#8217;s involved in, but he&#8217;s changing the game for what it means to be a businessman from LA,&#8221; Miller said.  Attendee Ronna Williams said Ice Cube represents LA well and inspires the black community.  &#8220;(He) takes LA wherever he goes,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;I got very emotional because he gives our culture hope &#8211; our young men growing up, he gives them hope because he came from the 'hood.'&#8221; ",[],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.mrcube.courtesy.jpg

Voter turnout jumped from 16.18% to 30.06% in an election in which 30 candidates competed for the 15 positions, compared to 16 total candidates last year. Additionally, only six of the 15 seats were uncontested this year, as opposed to nine in 2019.  The presence of referendums on the ballot may have incentivized students to vote, said Navi Sidhu, the Undergraduate Students Association Elections Board chair.  Referenda that affect student fees are historically associated with higher turnout. The last time students were able to vote on financial referendums was in 2016, which drew more than 40% of students.  Improved student outreach also boosted voter turnout, Sidhu said.  This time around, the election board was incredibly organized and tactical with how it approached advertising, Sidhu said. We use research and analytics to figure out the best sort of mediums to engage students. We also did an incredible amount of outreach that was probably incomparable to past years.  In order to drive up engagement, the elections board distributed $15,000 worth of gift cards to students who voted. Since the boards budget comes directly from student fees, they thought this was a good way to give back, Sidhu said.  While I understand that it might seem like the $15,000 expense for giveaways might have been unnecessary given the circumstances, it was providing some money, albeit a low amount of money, back directly to the students, Sidhu said. So I consider that a win.  Naomi Riley, the incoming USAC president, said 30% voter turnout is a good starting point, but added that it also showed that USAC needs to increase its accessibility and transparency to students. Riley has emphasized student engagement in her candidacy, proposing a Congressional Advisory Board where other student leaders could advise USAC on its decisions.  The 2020 election was marked by the unprecedented need to move all election related operations online. Its effects on voter turnout was mixed.  As the election season began, the elections board was worried about the lack of physical campaigning, since much of student engagement is fostered through flyering on Bruin Walk, Sidhu said.  However, the board came up with alternative ways to promote student engagements, Sidhu said. This involved overhauling the elections board website to increase the accessibility of candidate information, providing candidate qualifications and platforms, and partnering with Ballotpedia and EnCiv to host a virtual Meet the Candidate event.  So I'm hoping this year we establish a precedent, Sidhu said. And I think that next year, if they were to copy what we've done this year and they also had physical campaigning, voter turnout could continue going higher and higher.  However, as the entire election process shifted online, there was a surge of sanctions related to campaign violations, said Alfred Tun, the investigations director of the elections board.  Dealing with sanctions this year has been hectic particularly because sanctions are very time sensitive, Tun said. Especially given the virtual election that we have, people were in general more eager to report violations regarding hashtags and disclaimers that were required by social media regulations.  The improvements in the accessibility and transparency of the elections board made it easier for observers to report violations, Sidhu said. This, coupled with the competitive nature of many election seats, drove up the number of complaints that were submitted, he added.  This election saw high voter turnout as well as increased hate speech online, Tun said. This was in part propelled by controversies surrounding the referendums, he added.  Students who were not happy with the referenda resorted to toxic attacks, which were of course not acceptable, Tun said. We had to issue statements from the election board against hate speech. We tried our best to moderate the language as much as possible but our resources were limited.  Riley said her campaign tried to actively distance her from all the toxicity online.  I think that this election has been particularly toxic for me, especially being a black woman, Riley said. I want people to give me constructive criticism on how they would be better represented by me, but I think that theres a fine line between constructive criticism and overt discrimination and harassment.  Rileys council was sworn in Tuesday night and held its first council meeting Wednesday morning.  &nbsp;",['cap-genesis-qu'],"['news', 'student-government']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/5.14.news_.voterturnout-01-1024x753.png

Freshman utility Lexi Sosa tossed a perfect game in game one of No. 1 UCLA softball's (25-1) Saturday doubleheader against Boston University (13-7) in the UCLA/Long Beach State Invitational, leading the Bruins to a 10-0 victory. Sophomore pitcher Megan Faraimo made back-to-back wins as she held No. 18 Minnesota (14-9-1) hitless through four innings in the nightcap en route to her 10th complete game and 10th game with double-digit strikeouts.  Junior pitcher Holly Azevedo and Sosa then combined for a three-hit shutout in UCLA's rematch against Cal Poly (10-13) to wrap up the tournament with an 8-0 win.  Of the 15 batters Sosa faced in the mercy-rule victory, she sent down six on strikes and induced six ground outs. It was the first perfect game by a Bruin since Donna Kerr in 2008, who also happened to be in the stands Saturday for the Bruins' 2010 national championship team reunion.  ""I told (Sosa) a big part of being a Bruin is making history,"" said coach Kelly Inouye-Perez. ""People dont get to throw perfect games in their whole careers.""  After retiring the side in the second, Sosa bypassed the team huddle to get her helmet and batting gloves, as she was hitting leadoff in the bottom of the inning. On a 1-1 count, Sosa launched her first home run as a Bruin to put them up 2-0 over the Terriers.  Inouye-Perez said Sosa  who finished the day with two hits and four RBIs  continued to add onto the legacy of two-way UCLA pitchers in her fourth win of the season.  ""What (Sosa) looked like is exactly what we associate this program with  its the two-way players that can hit and pitch,"" Inouye-Perez said. ""I mean, what a day.""  Faraimo allowed only three baserunners in game two against the Golden Gophers on Saturday  a walk to the first batter of the game and two doubles in the fourth and seventh innings, respectively.  Each batter that followed them in the lineup met the same fate  a punch out.  ""Most impressively, when they did get a hit, (Faraimo would) get the next girl out and I think thats the sign of what great pitchers do,"" Inouye-Perez said.  Faraimo retired 10 consecutive batters with seven strikeouts after that first-inning walk. And after the Golden Gophers' fourth-inning double, she retired another nine batters in order.  The UCLA coaching staff created a new statistic for what happens after a pitcher allows a baserunner  the ""Lisa Fernandez stat,"" named after the Bruins' assistant coach Lisa Fernandez, a renowned UCLA softball alumna. ""Its what you do after something happens,"" Faraimo said. ""After I give up a hit or someone gets on base or is in scoring position, I always try to come back with at least a strike or get that next batter out.""  In the batter's box, the Bruin lineup was held hitless through the first three innings by Minnesota pitcher Autumn Pease. It was only the second time this season  even including UCLA's exhibition against Team USA on Feb. 23  the Bruins failed to record a hit during their first chances at the plate.  Inouye-Perez said she was expecting a heavy dose of offspeed pitches after facing the Golden Gophers a year ago in the Women's College World Series semifinal.  ""The offspeed is the one neutralizer for everyone,"" Inouye-Perez said. ""When you change speeds it takes away the timing element. I knew it was going to be a good game today and it came down to that one critical inning so Ill take it.""  Two infield singles in the fourth inning and a fielding error by Minnesota's first baseman broke the stalemate and loaded the bases for junior infielder Delanie Wisz, who had hit a go-ahead, three-run homer the night before against No. 22 UCF.  On the first pitch she saw, Wisz uncorked a grand slam over the left field wall to put UCLA up 4-0.  ""(Wisz is) something special,"" Inouye-Perez said. ""Theres times in a bases-loaded situation when someone can almost overdo it and try too hard. Shes teaching us just how clutch she is.""  Wisz had struck out in her first at-bat against Pease, who, besides the Bruins' four-run fourth inning, kept UCLA hitless and off-base for the entire game.  ""That (first) at-bat, I got a first-pitch strike and I took it,"" Wisz said. ""I was going to come out first pitch swinging if it was there so thats what happened.""",['cap-vinny-lavalsiti'],"['softball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.softball.DS_.jpg

The first two goals were vague enough that she didnt have to complete much of anything to check them off the to-do list.

Her office advocated for students with dependents and had a vote planned for spring to provide priority enrollment for these students. She created and distributed a survey to transfer students to improve student orientation, though it continues to be unclear as to what it would have accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp;    The quarterly pamphlet, by her own admission, did not go as well. The office only received 11 responses from clubs and Oraha claimed the pamphlet became very difficult to complete.&nbsp;    Ultimately, the board saw very little in the way of initiative or dedication when it came to making a difference for transfer students at UCLA, and unfortunately, Orahas vague platforms allowed her to slip through the cracks on the claim of completing platforms that never asked much of her office in the first place.&nbsp;    There were upsides, though. Orahas office took to social media in an unprecedented way compared to previous years. She also made a point to be available and present for the campus community  hosting weekly office hours, flyering on Bruin Walk and hosting Bruin Transfer Pride Week.&nbsp;    The offices biggest event this year, a transfer gala, was canceled because of COVID-19, but Oraha ensured that her offices surplus funds were donated to the Transfer Student Center.    At the end of the day, the transfer student representative is a relatively new position. As an office run primarily by students with two years on campus, Oraha acknowledged the shortcomings that come with high turnover and lackluster knowledge transfer.&nbsp;    The offices shortcomings are understandable  and so are Orahas. As such, the board genuinely hopes that the transfer student representative can serve its community a little better next time around.

With 12 separate committees, 25 committee directors and a staff for each to oversee, Sridhar had her work cut out for her.    She understood how to delegate like a professional  each committee under her office was more active than in years past, with large intern classes and consistent programming to show for it. Some of the events this year went above all expectations in size and turnout  for example, the Body Image Task Force collaborated with Campus Events Commission to host activist and actor Jameela Jamil, which drew hundreds of students.&nbsp;    Sridhar also completed most of her platforms when she wasnt busy overseeing committees, although there have been some setbacks.&nbsp;    Her Health Insurance Awareness Day platform has pivoted since her election and is now set to take the form of a collaborative website between SWC and the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center that will detail health insurance plans, including UC Student Health Insurance Plan, in an accessible way. Sridhar was working with the Title IX Office before the pandemic to create accessible infographics for students considering reporting, which was part of her Make Title IX Mine initiative. And she has an agreement with UCLA to implement semipermanent infrastructure on campus that will hold signs with messages that promote health and well-being.&nbsp;    In some ways, she didnt complete any of her platforms as planned. But this board recognizes her tremendous ability to be flexible and effective  and we trust that ability has served her commission during COVID-19.    While Sridhar excelled in delegation and completion, she has room for growth in what her office shares with the student body. Its easy for the commissioner to assume that the event-based nature of the commission absolves it from providing more accessible budget reports, but that assumption conflates the successful engagement of SWC with its transparency efforts.&nbsp;    In the years to come, SWC must make a concerted effort to make its programming fund budget accessible  as of now, funds that have not been requisitioned by the clubs they were allocated to are not open to the public.

This is an evident theme in the Trump administration  unabashedly implementing regressive measures, which undo protections for individuals who are undocumented, LGBTQ+ populations and the environment.  Now, theyre doing the same to survivors of sexual violence or harassment.  Almost a decade ago, the  Dear Colleague L  etter "" issued by the U.S. Department of Education and its Office for Civil Rights required colleges to investigate sexual assault complaints and discouraged cross-examining the accusers.  But Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos  announced  revisions to Title IX  rules  Wednesday, which ultimately afforded stronger protections to students accused of sexual assault and allow for the cross-examination of both the accusers and the accused.  The new Title IX rules set an alarming precedent for sexual assault accusers moving forward. The strengthened protections for the accused and the ability to cross-examine both the accused and the accuser could deter accusers from stepping forward. And forcing universities to implement these archaic rules during a global pandemic when they dont have the resources to fight back is even worse.  University of California President Janet Napolitano criticized the amended Title IX rules and claimed the UC will continue to fight against college sexual misconduct.  Although the UC has filed lawsuits in the  past  against the Trump administration, specifically against their decision to end DACA, it seems unreasonable to expect them to do the same given the  financial strain  the UC has faced because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  What they can do is work with what theyve got  which includes Napolitanos promise to provide fair processes for both parties while approaching cases with care and compassion.  Even without DeVos new regulations, Title IX cases such as ones at  Stanford University  and  Yale University , were described as grueling and veering toward victim-blaming.  With the new Title IX rules that now explicitly allow lawyers to cross-examine both the accuser and the accused in mandated live hearings, such processes will only become much more emotionally scarring and traumatic for accusers who mightve been hesitant to come forward at all in the first place.  Even at UCLA, recent  increases  in reporting may fall as protections for the accused may make it harder for accusers to come forward. And for a Title IX Office already dealing with an uptick in reported cases, a drawn-out process will only lead to more backlog, lengthening the trauma of an extended trial for sexual assault survivors.  Admittedly, the new rules in place aim to give both parties a fair due process  a reasonable desire on the Department of Educations end. However, there are other avenues to promote due process without actively adding to the trauma and deterring accusers, something made evident with Chanel Miller and her victim impact  statement  during the 2016 Stanford sexual assault case. And considering that false reporting rates are  only between 2%-10% , cross-examinations seem unnecessarily excessive. Ultimately, accusers might find it extremely hard to seek justice when they're forced to testify beside the accused.  Because for accusers, the new rules in place could mean two steps backward and never coming forward.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/edi-5-1024x618.png

But between four hour wait times, crashing voting machines and the impending pressure of work and classes, voting became a chore rather than a privilege for many Bruins.  On Super Tuesday, March 3, many students waited in line for more than four hours to vote in Ackerman Union. The closest alternatives, the Hammer Museum and Warner Avenue Elementary School, both posed multiple-hour wait times throughout the day.  Pizza, snacks and even ""The Princess Diaries"" actress Heather Matarazzo were there to keep spirits high. But when it comes to the historically atrophied youth vote, engagement shouldnt be so discouraging  especially given the high stakes of the 2020 California Democratic primary contest.  And UCLA didnt do much to help where it could have.  Most students dont have four hours to spare in the middle of week nine. While some sacrificed their class attendance in order to vote, many ended up casting provisional ballots  or not voting at all  to avoid missing valuable participation points in class.  The university shouldnt stick students between civic engagement and academia, especially considering the size of the youth voter base that exists on campus. Considering that voting is such a time commitment, professors at UCLA could facilitate students choices to vote by excusing classes or making attendance optional on election days. Super Tuesday is a regional holiday, but going to class for students is a job they cant always afford to miss in the weeks before finals.  When it comes down to waiting for another two hours to vote or attending a mandatory class, students are left with a moral dilemma between civic duty and their academic commitments.  Despite the common perception that campuses are a hotspot for political activism and participation, college students historically have the  lowest  voter turnout rates compared to any other age group. But this is starting to change  between the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, the rate of eligible college voters casting their ballot  skyrocketed  from 19% to 40%.  Voter turnout is never going to reach 100% so long as the privilege of voting is intertwined with the consequences of losing valuable time. Its a systemic problem, and it is in no way contained to students  voting barriers, such as reduced voting hours and voter ID requirements, disproportionately affect low-income and minority individuals.  And for the  70% of full-time students  who are also working, voting can understandably become a secondhand responsibility.  Granted, UCLA has provided some options. Mail-in ballots are always available to reduce wait times, and some voting centers were open for more than a week leading up to Super Tuesday. These alternatives allowed students to proactively vote and could have mitigated miserable waiting times Tuesday  but it seems that students remained unaware or chose to procrastinate.  Regardless of the inclination to wait until the very last minute, professors and offices at UCLA can still remove the burden of required classroom attendance that forces voters out of line and into their seats.  Students are starting to realize the power of their vote and use it.  But its a choice they might not always have the time to make.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/edi-art-1024x618.png

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 27 to provide economic relief from the COVID-19 pandemic. UCLA received about $36 million under the CARES Act, half of which will be used to give students emergency financial aid.  The other $18 million will be used for general institutional support, such as paying all employees their salaries and bonuses, said Millen Srivastava, the 2019-2020 Undergraduate Students Association Council Financial Supports commissioner.  Out of the $18 million allocated to student aid, $8 million will be given as $200 universal grants to undergraduate and graduate students who are enrolled at least half time for the 2020 spring quarter. The remaining $10 million will be granted to students with demonstrated financial need.   [Related:    USAC committees offer reliefs funds to assist students affected by COVID-19]    The UCLA administration decided to offer a universal grant in addition to need-based grants after discussions with USAC and the Graduate Students Association, which said both grants were necessary because all students have been affected by COVID-19, said Letty Trevi&#241;o, vice president of Academic Affairs for GSA.  &#8220;We really needed to think about who we thought was the most affected,&#8221; Trevi&#241;o said. &#8220;We concluded, with the students and all of the administration, is that everyone has been affected by COVID-19 in some way, shape or form.&#8221;  The universal grant, in addition to need-based aid, gives students a buffer against sudden financial impacts caused by the pandemic, Srivastava said.  Ricardo Vazquez, a UCLA spokesperson, said the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office is reviewing hundreds of appeals from students whose financial situations have been personally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and is coordinating with the basic-needs group and the Economic Crisis Response Team at UCLA to provide additional resources to students.  Both undergraduate and graduate student leaders agreed that UCLA had to provide for students who did not qualify for financial aid under the CARES Act, said Trevi&#241;o.  In response, UCLA established a private institutional fund using funding not already legally tied up within their budget to provide financial aid to students who are not eligible to receive relief under the CARES Act because of their citizenship status, Srivastava said.  Srivastava added this method allows all students to receive some financial support, while still providing more help to the most affected.  &#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to exclude those who need more (aid) by giving out (only) universal funding,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The most equitable decision would be to distribute the majority of the funding back to financial aid packages so our most marginalized are protected and those that need it the most get the money they need.&#8221;  However, UCLA&#8217;s prediction of student financial need might not accurately reflect student needs because of hidden costs, such as living expenses, said Alexander Astin, a professor emeritus of higher education and the founding director of Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA.  &#8220;You wonder how much an undergraduate student will really be affected by $200, simply given how much everything costs these days,&#8221; Astin said. &#8220;There are always individual cases that have more or less need, depending on their situation.&#8221;  Since most students are feeling some kind of financial pressure and stress in varying degrees, every little bit helps, Astin added.  Srivastava said the financial aid will be distributed to students based on their FAFSA eligibility.   Students who have filed a FAFSA form and qualify for CARES Act funding will receive the universal grant and will receive money from the need-based grant based on their FAFSA status, she said.  Students who haven&#8217;t filed a FAFSA form but still qualify for CARES Act funding and students who don&#8217;t qualify for CARES Act funding because they are not U.S. citizens will receive the universal grant and can receive need-based funding by filling out a financial aid form on MyUCLA, she added.  Although there are currently no plans from the UCLA administration to distribute more financial aid, Srivastava said the USAC Financial Support Commission and External Vice President's Office are planning to apply for more funding from UCLA to open a second round of applications for their COVID-19 Relief Fund.  ""If we receive more federal funding, we will be advocating for UCLA to keep opening and providing private institutional grants,&#8221; Srivastava said. &#8220;We want to make sure that all students are being heard.&#8221; ",['cap-queenie-xiang'],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.news_.moneycares.file_.jpg

Q : What are some techniques that can help improve my memory?   A : Memory techniques such as the Roman Room method, mnemonics and limericks can be used to remember information that may be difficult to remember.  The process of memory formation begins with receiving information. The information then enters the short-term working memory, which is like a holding tank, said Linda Ercoli, the director of geriatric psychology at UCLA.  Information is processed into long-term memory by memorization, Ercoli said. It can then be recalled from long-term memory back into the holding tank, where it becomes consciously available and can be used, she said.  One can improve memory by making information more meaningful, Ercoli said.  &#8220;(You can memorize a phone number) either by repetition or by looking for patterns in the phone number to make it meaningful,&#8221; she added.  There are three steps to committing something to memory, said Karen Miller, a neuropsychologist and clinical professor of health sciences at UCLA. The first step is paying close attention to a piece of information, the second is moving the information into working memory and the final step is learning the information, which transforms it into long-term memory, she said.  Working memory is utilized when actively engaging with information, such as working through the numbers from a math problem, she added.  &#8220;(In the learning phase), we're taking in the information across multiple repetitions,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;It's really important that we have multiple exposures to the new information over multiple time points so that we actually have stronger learning or encoding of the new information.&#8221;  Memory encoding is when sensory information is converted into electrical and chemical signals to be stored in the brain.  There are many different categories of memory, including rote memory, contextual memory and visual memory, Miller added.  Rote memory is used for learning isolated facts or bullet points, such as memorizing the periodic table, said Miller. Contextual memory is story-based, used in remembering historical events, whereas visual memory is for memorizing pictures and geometric information, she said.  Miller said the most basic methods for improving memory are to improve one&#8217;s attention and increase one's exposure to the material.  Most people need to look at new information at least five times in order to recall it during a test-taking situation, which ideally should not occur on the same day, Miller said.  When studying for a test, distributing practice and consolidating your notes frequently in separate intervals is much more effective than cramming, Ercoli said. It is important to review new material within the first 24 hours of exposure as most of the forgetting occurs within that time.  &#8220;(Students should) take notes while (in lectures), and then go home and study the notes that day within 24 hours because it will help solidify it,&#8221; Ercoli said.  Sleep is also an important factor for consolidating a new memory, Ercoli said.  &#8220;The cram method is like the antithesis of what people should be doing because you're flooding yourself with information, you're not distributing it and you're not sleeping,&#8221; Ercoli said.  Gary Small, a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA, said he introduced the method &#8220;Look, Snap, Connect.&#8221;  ""Look"" is a reminder to focus your attention, as the biggest reason for forgetting something is a lack of focus. ""Snap"" reminds you to take a mental snapshot of the information, which engages the brain&#8217;s natural ability to remember visually. ""Connect"" links up the mental snapshot with the information, making the information more meaningful.  Small explained how he uses ""Look, Snap, Connect"" to remember names and faces.  &#8220;(If someone&#8217;s) name is Samuel and he's got a long beard, I might see him as a biblical character Samuel,&#8221; Small said. &#8220;(If someone) has a bubbly personality, and maybe her name is Shirley, I think of the movie 'Airplane!,' where they have that joke &#8211; &#8216;Stop calling me Shirley.&#8217;&#8221;  The Roman Room method is particularly useful for remembering things in order, such as memorizing a speech, Small said.  The Roman Room method works by anchoring information to an environment familiar to you, such as your apartment. This information can then be sequentially retrieved when you take a mental walk through this space.  Small explained how students can use their walks to campus as their mind palace by associating information with UCLA landmarks such as Pauley Pavilion and Ackerman Union.  &#8220;First I might go by  ... Pauley Pavilion and I might see something I want to remember there,&#8221; Small said. &#8220;Then I go to Ackerman Union, and (Bruin Walk), (Janss) Steps.&#8221;  The Roman Room method is taught as a part of UCLA&#8217;s memory training program, alongside other techniques such as the story method, to help improve attention and contextual memory, both Miller and Small said.  The story method helps a person remember something by attaching new information to something a person already remembers, Small said.  &#8220;You're basically anchoring new information on information that's already in your memory stores,&#8221; Small said. &#8220;If you think about how you structure a story, you probably do something like that instinctively.&#8221;  Small, Miller and Ercoli collaborated to create and teach the program, which has now expanded to 160 sites, including countries such as China, Brazil and Canada.  &#8220;People come to UCLA and they purchase the UCLA programs that Dr. Small and I've created,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;Then we train them, and then they take it back to where they are practicing psychology or medicine.&#8221; ",['cap-april-peng'],"['news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/0BF09CA6-1BBE-49D1-BF88-A9F57C9DD1BB-1024x998.png

The well-seasoned American rock band returned from its three-year hiatus Friday with ""Wake Up, Sunshine,"" its newest album, which offers a welcome sense of nostalgia alongside a new narrative. Tonally, ""Wake Up, Sunshine"" falls in line with the band's previous albums, as   the vocals of lead singer Alex Gaskarth consistently complement the skills of guitarist Jack Barakat, bassist Zack Merrick and drummer Rian Dawson. The combined result is lively and boisterous, as All Time Low explores its journey of self-discovery.  Opening with ""Some Kind of Disaster,"" the soft hints of Dawson's drums lay the groundwork for Gaskarth to ask his playfully dangerous question, ""What are you after?"" The singer answers with the track's title, as the electric guitar riff kicks off the rest of the album. The vivacious vocals and pounding drums feed off each other until the song practically begs for the roar of a sold-out venue.  The raucous energy maintains itself for the first third of the album with ""Sleeping In,"" ""Getaway Green"" and ""Melancholy Kaleidoscope."" Together, the three tracks generate a memorable dynamism even as the band dives into the low points of its sonic narrative. Much of the electric atmosphere can be attributed to Barakat, whose skill with the guitar drives the synth edges of ""Getaway Green"" into the rock exhilaration between each verse of ""Melancholy Kaleidoscope.""   [Related:    Music Preview: Spring quarter album releases will focus on returning to raw, personal writing   ]   The soaring tempos bleed into the album's titular track, but narratively, All Time Low tackles a more nuanced message. Between Dawson's steady work on the drums, the track packs a loaded question as Gaskarth soulfully belts out ""Are you livin' well?"" to begin and end the track. The band tactfully balances powerful rhythmic guitar and drums with questions that demonstrate the record is more than just a re-visitation of its riotous sound.      While Dawson gets his chance to shine, it's Merrick's bass that rises to the forefront in ""Monsters,"" one of two songs on the album that features another artist. Guest singer   blackbear's smooth and deep vocals pair beautifully with Gaskarth's evocative tones. The two enter a heartbreaking back-and-forth conversation in which Gaskarth demands an answer to ""Why do I run back to you?"" blackbear offers the toxic truth as he responds, ""I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me.""    However, while blackbear poses a vocal juxtaposition to Gaskarth, it's the second band featured on the album that builds upon its sonic cohesion. The Band CAMINO lends vocals to the ninth track ""Favorite Place,"" which is placed just as the album shifts to its conclusion. The tonal similarities between All Time Low and The Band CAMINO result in a seamless collaboration. So while The Band CAMINO's lead singer Jeffery Jordan and Gaskarth sing about star-crossed lovers, perhaps the real ""Favorite Place"" is at the intersection of the two bands.  Collaborations aside, the latter third of the album examines a journey of self-growth beyond what might result from heartbreak. Gaskarth notes that ""There'll be a future down the road"" even as poses the timely question of ""Why don't you take a little time to get away?"" in ""Safe."" In a moment when the world has never seemed more desolate, All Time Low grants a sense of optimism and self-awareness to generate its own light.   [Related:    Album review: Dua Lipa&#8217;s &#8216;Future Nostalgia&#8217; wows with throwback disco sound and relevant themes   ]   The Baltimore band expertly closes out its album with ""Basement Noise,  "" sprinkling in just the right amount of nostalgia as it melodically honors its humble garage beginnings. Gaskarth's voice shines as the band strips back its heavy instrumentals, leaving the vocal foundations of All Time Low's sound front and center. The track's lyrics are a poetic homage to All Time Low itself &#8211; the garage band that left its mark on the industry with ""Nothing Personal"" back in 2009.  And   nothing has changed, as ""Wake Up, Sunshine"" functions as an album to be ""laughed at, laughed with, just because.""

""(Coach Adam Wright) didn't even know what to say,"" Hill said. ""We were all in shock.""  UCLA womens water polo (19-2, 2-0 MPSF) saw its season canceled just five games out from the postseason. The Bruins finished the year tied for second in the Collegiate Water Polo Association rankings and never dropped out of the top five.  The team was on the road in Stockton, California, after defeating then-No. 23 Pacific for its second win in as many days. But after Wright and his team returned to Southern California on March 8, everything changed.  ""(On March 11), we start hearing about the possibility of no fans in the stands,"" Wright said. ""By Thursday night, everything had been suspended. By Friday, seasons were done. Because it happened so suddenly, it didn't seem real.""  Although the season ended abruptly, Wright said his third season at the helm for the women's program was not a lost year. UCLA finished 1-1 against its crosstown rival USC. Hill scored twice in the victory Feb. 9 to give Wright his first win against the Trojan's women's team. The Bruins tallied 15-consecutive wins from Jan. 18 to Feb. 22, the longest streak of Wright's time as the women's coach.  Though it was just her first season in Westwood, Hill was the breakout star for the Bruins. The All-MPSF First-Team selection had 41 goals on the season, including a season-high seven in UCLA's Jan. 26 matchup versus then-No. 21 Wagner. Hill said playing in her first collegiate games was the high point of her rookie year in Westwood.  ""You practice every single day, twice a day,"" Hill said. ""Practice can be really tough, so when you get to play a game, it can be a break. Playing every game made me really excited.""  Hill helped fill the void left by two of the Bruins' top-three scorers from 2019  redshirt senior attackers Maddie Musselman and Bronte Halligan  who had spent the year training for Tokyo 2020. With the games being postponed until 2021, it's unclear whether the two  who combined for 95 goals in 2019  will return to play another game at the Spieker Aquatics Center.  Senior defender Brooke Maxson was one of 11 players to score at least 10 goals for the Bruins. Before the cancellation of the season, Maxson was one of two seniors who were not expected to return next season. With her senior season cut short, she said she has thoughts about returning to Westwood if UCLA Athletics grants her an extra year of eligibility.  ""I think there's a lot of unknown globally,"" Maxson said. ""There hasn't been a lot of communication (from UCLA Athletics). Just a little bit here and there, nothing set in stone.""  While Wright did not have the opportunity to see his team in the postseason, he said it was unlike either of the two he had before.  ""With this group, there's absolutely no regret,"" Wright said. ""There's a million what-if scenarios. You know when a group is special. This team was headed without a doubt to a place where they were gonna have a chance to be the best in the country.""",['cap-jack-perez'],"['sports', 'womens-water-polo']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/24b12d32-176c-4a0c-b736-c8075629f4bd.jpg

As the United States grapples with the changes necessitated by the novel coronavirus, such as social distancing and the closure of many nonessential businesses, many people fear some of these temporary changes could permanently alter the institutions that define U.S. democracy   &#8211; specifically elections.  Many state primary elections scheduled for March and April have been postponed into June and July, and the Democratic National Committee postponed the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee set for the week of July 13 to the week of August 17. Leaders in these states worried traditional elections could expose voters to the coronavirus through interaction with poll workers and other voters, as well as through the use of shared equipment.  To mitigate expected lower turnout and encourage social distancing, politicians are looking to expand absentee mail-in voting by extending deadlines and sending out mail-in ballots to all registered voters. Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado and Hawaii already rely primarily on mail-in ballots.  However, implementing this change in other states could prove more difficult.   For one thing, many people fear sending mail-in ballots to every registered voter could be too costly for some states. The Brennan Center for Justice estimated this overhaul could cost up to around $1.4 billion for the November election alone.   [Related:  Graphic: Breaking Down the Primaries ]    Aside from cost,   some are concerned there is simply not enough time to securely print and process mail-in ballots for the elections. Additionally, a massive public education campaign would need to be carried out to inform the public of the new systems and rules.  While many believe measures such as postponement, the expansion of all mail-in ballot elections and extensions for absentee voting protect citizens during the pandemic, others fear such changes are not only impractical, but also dangerous to democracy.  Recent events in Wisconsin illustrate the potential impact of changing traditional election rules.   Unlike other states, Wisconsin held its election as planned April 7 despite coronavirus concerns. This decision came from the Wisconsin Supreme Court after Gov. Tony Evers attempted to issue an executive order postponing the election to June 9. According to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the governor&#8217;s emergency powers do not authorize him to suspend or rewrite state election laws, which can only be altered through laws passed by the state legislature.  The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court order in Madison, Wisconsin,   which looked to extend the deadline for mailing in absentee ballots by six days. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that lower federal courts cannot change election rules so close to the election itself.  UCLA political science lecturer Ajax Peris explained why higher courts like the Wisconsin Supreme Court are hesitant to allow officials such as governors to postpone elections when governors   do not normally possess this power.   &#8220;If a decision to postpone is made in a partisan fashion, or made by the executive branch without approval of the legislature, then doing so can definitely set a dangerous precedent,&#8221; Peris said. &#8220;Not so much because of the postponement itself, but because of the process by which the decision is made.&#8221;   Despite fears that these rulings would result in extremely low voter turnout, 34% of the electorate voted either in person April 7 or through absentee mail-in ballots, a higher turnout than the 2012 primary,  according to NPR .   However, the election did not occur without its complications, especially in Milwaukee, where there were only five polling places instead of the planned 180. As a result, many voters in Milwaukee faced  longer wait times .  Some blame the seemingly chaotic election circumstances on the primarily Republican state legislators who refused to postpone the election, while others argue local Democratic officials in Milwaukee did not prepare adequately, failing to take advantage of resources such as the 2,500 members of the National Guard sent to work the polls.  This disagreement illustrates how partisanship shaped the nature of the primary election in Wisconsin. Moreover,   Peris explained how even pandemics can become political.   &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be a partisan issue, except they can&#8217;t agree on what&#8217;s most beneficial,&#8221; Peris said. &#8220;Or perhaps it&#8217;s partisan because officials at various levels are unwilling or unable to do the &#8216;most beneficial&#8217; thing, so they have to convince us that what they are doing is most beneficial.&#8221;  As we approach the November election, leaders will likely prepare for continued social distancing restrictions by increasing their capacity for mail-in ballots.  However, Peris notes that changing the rules for a general nationwide election is more difficult than for state primary elections.  &#8220;A general election can be thornier, because of the many rules at federal and state levels about the timing of newly elected officials taking office,&#8221; Peris said. &#8220;Or in the case of the president, the timing of the casting of the Electoral College votes.&#8221;  During this time of great change, it is important to consider how these temporary changes could permanently reshape our society. One thing we can be sure of is that this pandemic will continue to influence the 2020 presidential election as voters look for a leader in these   uncertain times.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was first created in 2012 by the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama administration, which allowed undocumented individuals who entered the country under the age of 16 to defer deportation and legally work in the U.S.  &nbsp;    The court voted 5-4 in favor of the University of California Regents, one of the first   entities   to challenge the termination of DACA, finding that the DHS decision to end the DACA program was both reviewable in court and arbitrary.&nbsp;    President Donald Trump issued an    executive order    in January 2017 directing federal agencies to execute immigration laws against removable aliens.    In response, the DHS revoked both DACA and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program in June 2017.    The DHS created DAPA in 2014, which would have extended the same rights to parents of DACA recipients.    However, multiple plaintiffs, including the UC Regents, challenged the decision to revoke DACA, claiming the decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment  .    The UC filed suit against the Trump administration in September 2017, claiming the Trump administrations decision to revoke DACA was unconstitutional   and violated the due process clause.    Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court's four liberal justices   to reach a majority ruling. Roberts also wrote the courts majority opinion declaring the termination of DACA unlawful.    UC President Janet Napolitano helped create DACA while serving as the secretary of homeland security under the Obama administration.    The Supreme Courts decision to uphold the University of California and the California attorney generals challenge against the Trump administrations capricious action is a victory for hundreds of thousands of young people who are making vital contributions to their families, schools, employers and the nation, Napolitano said in a press release Thursday.   &nbsp;",['cap-bernard-mendez'],"['national', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.breakingdaca.creativecommons.jpg

During her second year at Columbia University, the alumna found herself in an elevator with a cadaver during an internship and reconsidered her career trajectory. Park said she quickly realized she did not enjoy being around blood and dead bodies. Although the experience frightened her, she now writes science fiction romance novels based on real-life scenarios, such as being trapped in a zombie escape room. Her first novel, &#8220;The Perfect Escape,&#8221; which was published Tuesday, explores the life of Korean American teenager as he juggles fulfilling his family's expectations while staying true to himself.  After leaving the pre-med path, she went on to receive her Master of Business Administration from UCLA&#8217;s Anderson School of Management while practicing her stand-up comedy routines. She said she performed throughout the country, and recognizing comedy&#8217;s inherent subjectivity helped her to find her voice &#8211; quirky, relatable and slightly absurd. However, after 10 years of practicing stand-up, Park said she decided to use her experience to write young adult fiction novels mirroring her own life.  &#8220;Going through so many comedy venues and going all around the country, I could see that there was an audience for Korean American stories,&#8221; Park said. &#8220;I learned a few things from stand up. It really did help me hone in on my comedic voice. That's something that is very hard to teach.&#8221;   [Related:    Student self-publishes children&#8217;s book to broaden Asian American representation   ]   Both her first novel and her upcoming release, &#8220;Loathe at First Sight,&#8221; draw from her comedic background and feature real-life, nerdy scenarios of two people falling in love in unexpected places. However, &#8220;The Perfect Escape&#8221; is written for a young adult audience, while &#8220;Loathe at First Sight"" is an adult novel, as it takes place in a career setting and features adults working in the video game industry.  &#8220;I'd always written with a goal of creating something fun, quick and entertaining,&#8221; Park said. &#8220;(The books are) not your typical romantic comedy because there is action and adventure. But I also did want to have an underlying commentary on diversity, classism and privilege.&#8221;  [caption caption=""Park&#39;s first novel, &quot;The Perfect Escape,&quot; was published Tuesday. (Courtesy of Louisa Cannell)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_378400"" width=""683""]   [/caption]   In addition to its lighthearted romance, Park said her young adult book comments on how many young people, especially children of first-generation parents, often strive for practical, high-earning professional careers in sectors like law and medicine. However, Park said she wanted to use her book to highlight that such metrics of success do not necessarily lead to happiness as many assume.  &#8220;The Perfect Escape,&#8221; set in the near-future, follows a Korean American teenage boy named Nate Kim, who is an overachieving scholarship student, Park said. He tries to meet societal expectations by creating a company to alleviate the economic problems his family faces, reflecting Park&#8217;s experience growing up in America with first generation immigrant parents. Park said the protagonist&#8217;s experience mirrors the many socioeconomic problems these families face as they maintain working class jobs from running neighborhood dry cleaners to owning corner stores.  &#8220;I think, at least in my family, it was understood that the more education you got, the harder you work, that you could someday be financially successful,&#8221; Park said. &#8220;And I think that was something that always stuck with me.&#8221;  However, Nate meets an extremely wealthy girl at his school named Kate and realizes there&#8217;s more to life than wealth and class status, Park said. Nate and Kate eventually find a common bond over zombies, which strengthens their relationship and allows them to escape from their respective situations, with Kate acting as a symbol for what Nate strives to attain.   [Related:    Second-year student publishes her first book on self-help techniques   ]   Brent Taylor, Park&#8217;s literary agent, said her stand-up comedian background works to her advantage as a writer because she is able to incorporate humor into the novel through settings such as a zombie escape room. The genre is difficult to tackle, he said, because authors often neglect the second half of &#8220;romantic-comedy.&#8221;  &#8220;Park really put the comedy into romantic comedies,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;I feel like you see so many romantic comedies that have a lot of romance and just really not that much humor.&#8221;  The novel&#8217;s editor, Eliza Swift, said the editing process was filled with lots of laughter. She hopes the comedic interjections will provide relief from the stress of the current climate and ongoing pandemic.  &#8220;The most memorable moment was like the joy that she brought to me,&#8221;Swift said. &#8220;This book is such a fast-paced, super fun read, and it's the kind of thing that you can read and not have to think about the real world at all for a few hours.&#8221;  With the heightened racism against Asian American communities, Park said she hopes that her first novel will be a lighthearted escape for readers and provide a sense of positive representation for these communities. She said she hopes the novel will inspire young Asian Americans to contribute to the growth of positive Asian representation in the media.  &#8220;With all the negative noise right now in the media, plus the anti-Asian comments and the heat of politics, I wanted to write a fun and unique story, because I really think escapism is important to be able to step away from the real world and immerse yourself into something fun,&#8221; Park said ",['cap-mahnoor-ghatala'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/hz.web_.ae_.perfectescape.courtesy.jpg

Academic Affairs Commissioner Naomi Riley said her office is striking travel grant money funds and the Academic Affairs Commission &#8211; Academic Success Referendum because there's no more money in any of those funds. She added that her office allocated funding to Books for Bruins. She also said her office endorsed both CUB and GCGP referendums.  UCLA Residential Life national communications coordinator Arsh Gupta said he had a meeting with a couple of representatives from other schools on the West Coast to figure out a solution in response to this pandemic and to discuss what they've been doing so far in housing in general.  He also said UCLA Residential Life is still holding virtual events, and it has mostly focused on social engagement.  ",[],"['news', 'student-government']",

Hollywood made Ryan Murphy, so Murphy went and made &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; right back.  Murphy, producer and creator of myriad series of episodic television from &#8220;Glee&#8221; to &#8220;American Crime Story&#8221; developed the recently released miniseries with Netflix along with producer Ian Brennan. Set in post-World War II Los Angeles, ""Hollywood"" follows a group of young hopefuls struggling to make careers for themselves in the entertainment industry. With ""Pose"" producer helming the show as well, the limited series is chock-full of LGBTQ+ characters of myriad races and ages &#8211; a refreshing divergence from the usual media portrayal of the 1940s.    &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; is an optimistic portrayal of what the entertainment industry might have looked like if a progressive infusion of talent had started producing movies in the late 1940s. The contemporary talent used in the series is both robust and enormous, featuring the likes of film and television veterans from Murphy&#8217;s other projects, but it&#8217;s the fresh actors and actresses who really elevate the mini-series.  The show cheekily begins with burgeoning actor Jack Castello (David Corenswet)   obtaining a job at a full-service gas station in the middle of Los Angeles &#8211;  only it's quickly revealed the station also provides sexual services for customers with the right password. Though Jack shies away from serving male customers, fellow gas-man and aspiring screenwriter Archie Coleman (Jeremy Pope) is more than happy to do so, resulting in a relationship with another young Hollywood hopeful, Rock Hudson (Jake Picking).    [Related:    Movie review: &#8216;The Half of It&#8217; offers fresh perspective on what a teenage rom-com can be   ]   Corenswet and Pope masterfully capture their characters' blind naivety as they talk about their Hollywood dreams, regarding the area with a hopeful gleam in their eyes. All these fresh faces in the series add to the plausibility of their circumstances because, much like their characters, the actors are just dipping their toes into the industry.  However, Hudson in real life was a famous Hollywood heartthrob whose sexuality was called into question long before the actor died from AIDS-related complications in 1985. &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; portrays Hudson as a very green talent who gets taken advantage of by talent agent Henry Willson in an astounding portrayal by &#8220;The Big Bang Theory&#8221; alum Jim Parsons.  In their first meeting, Willson assures Hudson he wants to make him a star, requesting only sexual favors and 10% of his earnings in exchange.   Those who are locked into thinking of Parsons as the socially awkward Sheldon will see his true range through the cunning and shrewd industry middle-man Willson, who thinks nothing of sexually blackmailing a young actor    .  The theme of sexuality as capital makes itself exceedingly plain in the first half of the series  . The young actors are portrayed as having to offer sexual favors in order to advance their careers, as in both Hudson and Castello&#8217;s cases, but the layers of intrigue and bribery begin to peel away when the central plot of the series emerges.  By the latter half of ""Hollywood,"" the principal players become involved in the Ace Studios production of a fictional film called ""Peg."" Suddenly the three boys who worked at a gas station-turned-brothel are involved in an enormous studio production with a budget to match. This is the first big professional development of the series &#8211; after Jack, Archie and Rock exploit their bodies for professional advantage, each is rewarded with near-instant stardom. With their stardom, the three are able to obtain the Broadway musical version of the Hollywood Dream, and it's believable until it becomes belligerently up-beat   When the bigger-than-life studio mogul Ace Amberg (Rob Reiner) falls into a coma, his wife Avis (Patti LuPone) and studio executive Dick Samuels (Joe Mantello) take over the project. They change the title to &#8220;Meg,"" make the story about a young woman of color, cast the director&#8217;s girlfriend Camille Washington (Laura Harrier) as the lead and wait for the inevitable controversy. Crosses quickly burn on front lawns, protesters picket theaters and death threats are regularly called in. Not to mention the studio faces certain financial ruin for trying to do something as progressive in 1948 as producing a film with a nonmale, nonwhite lead.       [Related:    TV review: &#8216;Parks and Recreation&#8217; special provides warmth, laughter in face of COVID-19   ]   Just as the plot began to pick up the pace, however, ""Hollywood"" proves to be a Murphy-esque musical without any musical numbers. Avis, Dick and other studio workers remain stalwart about the film's production, facing one problem after another with nauseating positivity.   In the face of every challenge in every act of every episode, the solution proved to be a character delivering a dramatic soliloquy, and the rest of the cast carrying on with production, now more properly motivated. It's as if there were a per-episode monologue minimum, a standardized schedule of verbal motivation where characters constantly confess their desires and feelings. But the overly dramatic musical &#8211; robbed of its music &#8211; quickly turns into a soap opera.        By the end of the seven-episode, 347-minute soap it&#8217;s clear Murphy was trying to find a moment in the history of the film business ripe for untapped progressive opportunity and rewrite it himself. But what at first feels like a fun and interesting look at post-war Hollywood turns into dreamscape and saccharine fantasy, and the problems the studio encounters &#8211; from internal resistance to death threats &#8211; are often easily overcome.  In the end, however, &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; is a hopeful story,   remaining too fantastical to be considered realistic drama. It is, in essence, a long and soapy homage to a time and place that never existed, but the idea of which is endearing. If anything, it can serve as an inspirational guidepost to future leaders of the entertainment industry, as an artistic statement for inclusivity and equality regardless of social convention. But aspirations are only such because they have not yet been achieved.  By the finale, the title has become achingly appropriate &#8211; ""Hollywood"" remains forever in quotes as the fantastical idea of the area transcends its harsh realities.

There&#8217;s nothing quite like the rush of competition and the camaraderie created after working through a mountain of ups and downs toward a common goal.  I considered that common goal to be winning for most of my life, until I enrolled at UCLA and found myself teamless for the first time in 14 years.  There were teams to cheer on, sure, and I loved &#8211; and still love &#8211; being a Bruin. But there&#8217;s a striking difference between being on a team and being a fan of a team, which I did not really understand until my first year in Westwood.  You might be wondering: Why would someone who is not even trained to write about sports be talking so much about teams?  To be honest, I wondered the same thing as I brainstormed this column, meant to reflect on three years with The Bruin, and the word that kept wiggling its way into my head was &#8220;teamwork.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a cliche term that gets thrown around at job interviews and sports practices, but after several weeks of mulling it over, I realized it&#8217;s also the reason I stayed at UCLA altogether.  I used to believe being part of a team meant being a competitor &#8211; doing everything in your power to ensure a win for you and your teammates, whether that be cheering on the sidelines as a substitute or keeping calm when you&#8217;re falling behind and all eyes are on you. It wasn&#8217;t until I joined the Daily Bruin that I learned competition does not define a team, people define a team, and the strongest team I have ever been a part of is Copy.  Copy: one of the least competitive groups of people I&#8217;ve ever worked with and yet at the same time my favorite team to have ever been a part of.  I&#8217;ve come to understand that a team is more than a group of players working to win a game. A team is a foundation, a support system in which everyone you work with wants to see you succeed, whether you are close friends or not. Teammates cheer you on and help you up when you&#8217;re down because, not only are you all working together toward a common goal, but also they understand exactly how badly you want to make that goal a reality.  I have felt supported by Copy since the minute I walked into Kerckhoff 118 for my first copy editing shift and Rhiannon, a slot editor at the time, immediately welcomed me into the fold with jokes and an eagerness to show me the ropes. And there has not been one minute since that day when I&#8217;ve felt like Copy has not had my back. At every moment in the office I have been pushed by my teammates to achieve more and encouraged to grow into a leader. I have been supported when I make mistakes &#8211; and I&#8217;m no stranger to mistakes &#8211; and I have been praised for my accomplishments. But best of all, I have been able to share in the celebration of the successes of my teammates.  From winning national headline-writing awards to receiving well-deserved promotions to discovering and being rewarded for extraordinary skills outside of copy editing, the Copy team is one of the most talented I know. They work day in and day out, through late-night hours when the whole city seems to be asleep, not for the rush of competition or the glory of a win &#8211; copy editors don&#8217;t even get their name attached to a story &#8211; but to be good teammates.  I spent my first year at UCLA feeling lost and alone, unsure of why I couldn&#8217;t find a home here on campus. I learned in my second year that what I needed, what I was trying to find as a terrified and homesick first-year, was a team. I needed Copy, I needed the Daily Bruin, and I&#8217;m thankful each and every day that I found them.  I could endlessly shout out the teammates that have made Copy and the Daily Bruin feel like home &#8211; Maris Tasaka, the Copy dad to my Copy mom and someone whom chaos consistently follows but always has the time to help me when I&#8217;m overwhelmed; Zoe Willoughby and Sara Hubbard, the incoming Copy chiefs who continually impress me with their professionalism, resilience and ability to stay good-humored even at the most stressful times; and Anush Khatri, my predecessor, who offered me endless encouragement and help as I made the transition to a leadership role I felt utterly unqualified for &#8211; but this list is far from all-encompassing.  Even as I graduate, move away from UCLA and get kicked out of dozens of Slack channels, I know the Copy team is one that will be with me forever.  All this to say: Thank you team &#8211; I&#8217;ll always be rooting for you.

Occupying a modest spot on 9th Street in Downtown Los Angeles, the restaurant has   intrigued passersby with the neon glows of its dragon sign   since its Feb. 10 opening. As its straightforward name suggests, the restaurant aims to stake its claim within the popular ramen market, serving five distinct variants of the Japanese dish.  If not in the mood to slurp down noodles, 9th St. offers a small selection of rice bowls   as well, ranging from spicy tuna donburi to pork fried rice    in addition to a wide array of beer, wine and sake. With its uncomplicated menu and futuristic vibe, 9th St. Ramen provides a colorful sensory experience for both the eyes and the taste buds.  Upon entering the restaurant, customers experience a departure from the naturalistic colors of a typical ramen shop. White tiles, metallic tables and mirrors create a monochromatic look, while the space is illuminated in a distinctly reddish-blue hue. Squared pots containing artificial ferns are suspended from the ceilings, enhancing the futuristic aesthetic. In the vein of sci-fi noirs like ""Blade Runner,"" the reimagining of a ramen shop as a technological, neon hub of the future surprisingly works without being too gimmicky.  [caption id=""attachment_376153"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Opting for experimental decor, 9th St. Ramen is illuminated in a reddish-blue hue, reflecting a departure from the colors of a typical naturalistic ramen shop. (Esther Li/Daily Bruin)[/caption]   [Related:    Restaurant review: Tacos 1986 spices up Westwood food scene with vibrant, authentic Mexican flavors   ]   Within its compact space, the restaurant primarily features bar seating with only     a handful of booth tables. The lack of chairs in favor of bar stools adds to the sleek aesthetic, but may lead to uncomfortable seating for some customers. Still, the neon atmosphere strikes the right balance between cool and cozy, making it a ripe spot for a late-night social.  For appetizers, 9th St. submits its takes on the usual Japanese fare like edamame, spicy tuna and a mushroom tempura. The karaage fried chicken, which is marinated in koji sake, arrived with bite-sized chunks of chicken, a charred lemon, preserved sesame mayo and sliced pickles packed onto a small black plate.  Although the lemon functioned more as tangy garnish, the mayo provided a sweet, piquant contrast to the saltiness of    the chicken, which popped with savoriness underneath its crispy batter. The pickles were fresh and helped cleanse the palate after consuming the fried delights. At $10, the portion size wasn't generous, but the excellent flavors justified its price.  While 9th St. opts for an experimental decor, it doesnt aim to reinvent the hallmarks of traditional ramen  and wisely so. Beyond choosing one of its five broths  including tonkotsu pork, chicken tori, spicy lamb, black double soup and vegan onion and mushroom  9th St. permits some basic customization to personalize your ramen. Its signature noodle is created from toasted wheat and rye flour, but the restaurant also offers a gluten-free option. Additional toppings, which cost extra to include, are fairly standard in their variety  though $4 for truffle butter   seemed a tad excessive.  Priced at $16, the black ramen double soup mostly succeeded at creating an appetizing variant of the traditional Japanese dish. For black ramen, the broth was lighter in color than expected, leaning more on saltiness than sweetness. Sesame seeds, shredded nori and red cabbage floated decoratively at the top of the bowl, making for a pleasing presentation, though these elements quickly disappeared into the opaqueness of the broth.  While the garlic oil was disappointingly undetectable, the double soup preparation brought complexity to the broth, coating the toasted wheat and rye noodles with an unmistakably umami sensation. Though a bit heavy to finish, the broth had a sophisticated amount of   richness that permeated throughout the bowl.   [Related:    The Quad: Different styles of ramen and where to find them in Los Angeles   ]   The noodles themselves were satisfactory  , but not the highlight of the dish. With a medium thickness, they were appropriately firm, chewy and not too overcooked. On their own, however, they didnt add much in terms of flavor or texture, serving instead as a delivery system for more exciting ingredients.  The toppings were a somewhat mixed bag but acted as a complementary set of flavor profiles. The shoyu egg, which costs $2 to add, was the perfect consistency, with just a little runniness to its sweet and savory yolk. On the other hand, the slice of chashu pork was bland and tough instead of fatty and tender, making it a chore to consume rather than a harmonious part of the ramen. The pieces of cabbage swimming in the soup tasted fresh and crunchy, and their charred texture created a pleasant balance to the softness of the sliced mushrooms and charcoal grilled chicken.  Not every component was equal in quality, but the whole was greater than the sum of its parts, elevated by a complex broth and a handful of tastefully selected ingredients. The prices for ramen range from $15 to $17, providing above-average ramen at an average price point. If exploring the iconic sites of Downtown LA, 9th St. Ramen provides a delicious way to satisfy ramen cravings with solid appetizers and a one-of-a-kind science fiction ambience.

If copy editors are the readers&#8217; advocates, the Copy chief and assistant Copy chief are the ones making sure those editors have developed the skills to be just that.  Within Daily Bruin, the Copy section has the most editors &#8211; nine in total during the 2019-2020 year. Where most other sections typically have one top editor and anywhere between one and six assistant editors, Copy is led by one top editor, known as the Copy chief,   an assistant Copy chief and an additional   seven assistant editors known as slot editors.     The makeup of the Copy section's leadership is thus markedly different from other sections, and it can be confusing to understand what that difference means. Part of this difference stems from the roles of the chief and assistant chief.  The responsibilities of a copy chief do not differ all that much between news outlets, although the name of the role can differ depending on the newspaper. General responsibilities of copy chiefs, and their differently named counterparts, can   typically include managing workflow at the copy desk and overseeing  rimmers, slots and proofers.   The Daily Californian&#8217;s website, for example, refers to what appears to be its equivalent to a copy chief as a night editor. This is the person who is also at the head of the copy section and comes in at night to help oversee paper production.  For some newspapers, there is no distinction between a slot editor and a copy chief. But at The Bruin, there are a few additional duties the chief and assistant chief undertake.   In general, when the chief and assistant chief are on shift, their roles do not diverge that much from those of a slot editor. Just as slot editors are assigned one to two shifts in the office per week, so too are the chief and assistant chief.  Besides day-to-day shifts, though, there are a few unique pieces of content the chief and assistant chief are responsible for editing.  Generally, the Copy chief and assistant Copy chief split these additional   responsibilities, from alternating editing breaking football stories &#8211; which is often a six-plus-hour endeavor &#8211; to proofreading special issues like Daily Bruin&#8217;s quarterly magazine PRIME.   The chief and assistant chief are also typically the ones who meet with other sections' top editors to keep workflow as smooth and efficient as possible, and to ensure that sections are meeting Copy&#8217;s deadline and Copy is meeting the printer&#8217;s deadline.   Additionally, each week &#8211; and every other week with proofers &#8211; the chief and assistant chief meet with the slots and go through critiques. During critiques, slots pick up one to three print papers throughout the week, read through the same section of the paper for each day and look for any inconsistencies or copy errors we&#8217;ve missed. Going over critiques during meetings provides a forum to discuss and establish new style rules to avoid future   inconsistencies.  The Copy chief, though, has the added responsibilities of overseeing all hiring decisions within Copy, scheduling slots, rimmers and proofers   on all their shifts, evenly designating stories to slots when there are special issues and organizing the occasional Copy-wide meeting.     Copy-wide meetings provide an opportunity for the chief and assistant chief to address key topics and to give advice to the entire section. At one of this year's Copy-wide meetings, Saskia Lane, the 2019-2020 Copy chief, went over search engine optimization and how to utilize it to write an effective headline.  Apart from the many day-to-day roles, one of the most important jobs of the Copy chief and assistant chief is to facilitate the transition from one   year's editors to the next.   When I was hired as assistant Copy chief, one of my main goals was to ensure that I, along with Saskia and those who   had been in Copy for a while, passed down all the institutional knowledge we had accumulated over the years to new editors.   By their very nature, student newsrooms have quick editor turnarounds, and so much of being a copy editor is learning on the job. But this can be difficult when editors only have one or two shifts per week. So, it is essential we utilize our time wisely to guarantee this year&#8217;s interns and staff members are fully prepared to become next year&#8217;s editors.  Typically, because the Copy chief and assistant Copy chief will have had more experience editing than the slot editors, proofers and rimmers, they can act as a resource when staff members have style or wording questions and can help ensure Daily Bruin is maintaining a consistent style throughout the years.  This year, one of the ways we tried to achieve this was by developing a style guide &#8211; similar to what The Associated Press has &#8211; that is customized to the needs of the Daily Bruin and UCLA. This would include entries on topics ranging from what we would call buildings like the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on first and second references, to how stories like Q&amp;As should be formatted in print.  Slots this year and last year   have also worked on pet projects, such as walk-through guides for rimmers and proofers, for editors during intern training and for interns to refer to when on shift.   Although it can often be time-consuming for slots to undertake pet projects on their own time, having slots record as much of their knowledge as they can  &#8211; from which AP rules we don't follow to the design errors proofers should look out for  &#8211; ensures the learning curve is not as steep for incoming editors.  At the end of the day, as the Copy chief and assistant Copy chief, our jobs aren't just about being the readers' advocate; it's also about being the copy editors' advocate. And the way we can do that is by making sure the next crop of editors are well-trained, consistent and, most importantly, prepared to take over our jobs when the time comes.

From Jackie Robinson Stadium to the Rose Bowl, we selected our favorite uniforms from the special edition line worn by the Bruins.       Men's Volleyball   Jack Perez, Sports editor    [caption caption=""(Emily Dembinski/Illustrations director)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385435"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]      Classic looks always take the cake.   When Under Armour went to create the centennial jersey for UCLA men's volleyball, they had no shortage of options to take inspiration from. As one of the most successful programs in Bruin history, there is a multitude of former men's volleyball jerseys that signal an era of winning.  The white shorts and top combo gives a blank canvas for the designers to work on. Under Armour put a simple scheme together, but simple schemes work when the colors mesh as the Bruins' colors do.  Along with the letters ""UCLA"" on the front of the centennial design &#8212; the yellow that slowly trickles into a blue &#8212; the sleeveless uniform accentuates the numbers that would be flying around the court in Pauley Pavilion.  The cherry on top is the lining at the bottom of the shirts. While most of the other teams have this design on the sleeves or the front of the jersey, the blue and yellow trim works better as a separator between the layers of white. Crucially, it does not go overboard like a similar pattern on the men's basketball uniform.   The team could have gone crazy and thrown lots of wacky patterns onto the jerseys to try to show a bold new direction that would thrust UCLA into the future.  They instead decided to look into the past &#8211; at the history of this team's 19 national titles &#8211; and take pride in the longstanding traditions of the unit.   Gymnastics   Jon Christon, assistant Sports editor     [caption caption=""(Emily Dembinski/Illustrations director)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385436"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]    Among all the UCLA centennial uniforms, only gymnastics&#8217; leotards truly stand out.  What makes these uniforms unique is how complex they are, as they have multiple layers starting with the blue and white gradient base layer.  The blue shown in this base layer spans through every shade of UCLA blue before eventually turning into a white that perfectly compliments the rest of the colors on the uniform.  The next layer is the blue and yellow trim on the leotards that matches the rest of the uniform and makes them stand out even more. The trim also matches the UCLA lettering across the front chest &#8211; the best part of the uniforms.  As opposed to some of the regular leotards the gymnasts typically wear, the centennial versions have a big, proud &#8220;UCLA&#8221; across the front, written in half blue sequins and half gold sequins with a thin layer of white in between. The pattern makes the wordmark stand out just enough without being overbearing.  Any time you have the four iconic letters, it&#8217;s a positive, and they are something that should be on every Bruin uniform regardless of the sport.  As if all of that wasn&#8217;t enough, the leotards are loaded with sequins and glitter throughout to make each and every gymnast literally shine when she is on the mat.  The only negative associated with these uniforms? The fact that we only got to see them once all year.   Women's Volleyball     Taiyo Keilin, assistant Sports editor       [caption caption=""(Emily Dembinski/Illustrations director)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385437"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]    Aside from gymnastics, women&#8217;s golf and the soccer goalkeepers, none of the commemorative jerseys have material past the elbow.   Enter women&#8217;s volleyball.  There is something inherently elegant about long sleeves in sports, and these uniforms exemplify this elegance.   What&#8217;s more, is the sheer amount of white. The designers had plenty of canvas to work with but chose to leave most of it plain. Call me boring, but these jerseys aren't missing anything.   On the front, you have Under Armour&#8217;s logo, &#8220;UCLA&#8221; in the beautiful gold to blue gradient featured on all of the centennial uniforms and the player&#8217;s number. On the back, there is the centennial patch and the number, and on the right arm, nothing more than a small Pac-12 logo. Understated? Yes. Inadequate? No.  Most of the designs for the other sports incorporate a pattern of a speckled yellow strip sandwiched between two speckled blue strips somewhere on the uniform. For the basketball teams, it&#8217;s on the shorts. It appears on the back of the necks for baseball and softball, and down the sides for beach volleyball and cross country. I personally am not a huge fan of this pattern, which is why I like that on the women&#8217;s volleyball tops, it&#8217;s hidden away beneath the arms.  I&#8217;ve been focusing on the tops as that is where the special centennial design is, but the blue shorts &#8211; which are the same ones the team wears with all its other tops &#8211; complement the white jerseys perfectly. If they were white, it would be too much and any other color wouldn't make much sense.  The simplicity of these uniforms is what makes them the best. They check off all of the essentials of a uniform, display the centennial design and that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s enough in my book.  Baseball        Michael Waldman, assistant Sports editor    [caption caption=""(Emily Dembinski/Illustrations director)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385438"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]    From the simplicity of the Milwaukee Brewers&#8217; navy blue and yellow lettering to the classic green and gold script of the home whites of the Oakland Athletics, you can&#8217;t go wrong with a two-toned, white baseball jersey &#8211; and UCLA baseball&#8217;s centennial uniform is just right.   Featuring the four-letter, blue-and-yellow gradient across the middle, the white is clean and shines nicely against the rest of the field and lends itself well to a pair of white cleats.   The freshness of the diamond that you get when catching that first glimpse of the playing surface at a baseball game is underscored by the bright white, emphasizing a cleanliness that is as proper as a freshly cleaned home plate.  The Under Armour logo stays out of the way nicely, peaking out in the corner and complementing the darker shade of gold on the more finely chiseled number on the front.   The advantage of a baseball jersey &#8211; besides how it looks that much cooler after the shortstop makes a diving stop up the middle (with dirt, it&#8217;s two jerseys in one!) &#8211; is the hat, and this 'fit doesn&#8217;t disappoint in that category at all.  The white hat shies away from the gold-domed football helmet and replaces the traditionally blue Bruins&#8217; baseball bucket with the same centennial look and eye-popping UCLA lettering across it.   After all, the goal of these jerseys was to honor 100 years of sports in Westwood, and there is no better way to do that than to give baseball the sparkling white jersey it deserves.      Men's Soccer   Kyle Boal, assistant Sports editor       [caption caption=""(Emily Dembinski/Illustrations director)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385439"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]    The classic white uniform with a deep sky blue, sun gold gradient is clearly the basis for all of the centennial special edition uniforms.  As the rest of the editors focus in on minor details separating different white looks for the Bruins, the black, gold-striped goalkeeper jersey sets UCLA men's soccer far above the rest of the crowd and highlights a need for an alternative color combination.  The Bruins are no strangers to the tops of uniform lists. UCLA ranks No. 2 in Sports Illustrated&#8217;s top 10 uniforms in college basketball, and they come in at No. 21 for college football top 25 team uniforms according to NBC Sports Washington.  The Bruins&#8217; biggest program &#8211; men's basketball &#8211; stuck to the cliche centennial look and UCLA&#8217;s second-biggest program, football, did nothing more than adding the same centennial patch to already-vintage uniforms.   While the traditional blue, gold and white looks good on any Bruin, perhaps it&#8217;s time for UCLA to expand its color palette.  The Bruins have produced black, navy blue and all-white uniforms in the past but rarely seem to put them on for game day. In the case of the goalkeeper uniform, the traditional blue-and-gold gradient color scheme pops on a black background and not only gets the UCLA theme across but does so in a unique, eye-catching manner.  And with the department facing a deficit for the first time in 15 years, UCLA Athletics could use a new instrument to bring attention, aesthetic and life to all of its athletic programs &#8212; not just to soccer.  The men's soccer team may have rolled the dice on a black uniform, but it paid off.  It is time for other sports to take a chance to incorporate bold, contrasting colors in their uniforms to broaden the reach and appeal of athletics at UCLA.

Copy editors adjust capitalizations all the time. But rarely does that decision play a role in righting injustices.  Here at the Daily Bruin, we firmly believe that the nuances of language and words make a difference, which is why the recent protests following the death of George Floyd and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have sparked a particular conversation among The Bruin's Copy staff about whether or not to capitalize ""black"" in reference to race.  At The Bruin, we typically default to the Associated Press Stylebook, as many journalistic organizations do. Until Friday, AP dictated keeping Black   lowercase. However, after much deliberation, we decided June 5 to change our own style to be Black  with a capital B.  While the discussion and resolution at The Bruin occurred before AP's recent decision, AP's development reinforces The Bruin's and realigns our styles.  In a statement Friday, John Daniszewski, AP's vice president for standards, announced the change.  ""APs style is now to capitalize Black in a racial, ethnic or cultural sense, conveying an essential and shared sense of history, identity and community among people who identify as Black, including those in the African diaspora and within Africa,"" Daniszewski wrote. ""The lowercase black is a color, not a person.""  Previously,   it   has been Bruin policy that if a source were to ever ask to be referred to as Black, capitalized, we would honor that. It is, after all, our job as a news organization to represent our sources as accurately as possible.  For example, we did this when UCLA women's soccer alumna Kaiya McCullough preferred Black be capitalized in her senior signoff.  At The Bruin, in accordance with AP, we capitalize races such as Asian, Hispanic, Latina/o, Native American, etc. So, since we could come up with many reasons Black should be treated the same, and none   why it shouldn't, we decided to make the change.  This hasn't been the first time there has been discussion about the relationship between race and language at the Copy desk, either.  Last year, a topic of much discussion in Copy was APs elimination of the hyphen when referring to people of dual heritage, preferring, for example, Asian American over ""Asian-American."" A hyphen may seem like nothing more than a small mark between words, but to those who bore the brunt of nativist rhetoric deeming immigrants hyphenated Americans, they carry quite a bit of weight.  The same can be said for capitalization. To capitalize a word that isnt at the beginning of a sentence suggests it is more important than uncapitalized words    thus, in this situation, granting it a critical role in conversations about race.      As a student newspaper, we feel it is our responsibility to keep our fingers on the pulse of not only what the campus community is requesting, but also   what the global community is asking for.  And we aren't the only ones who have felt the need for a reevaluation on this particular issue of capitalization. The Los Angeles Times recently changed its style to Black, as did the Seattle Times.    The LA Times wrote they decided to make the change, ""As part of a commitment to our readers and our staff to document and fight racism whenever and wherever we encounter it.""  Though modern-day publications are making changes in an attempt to better represent Black people, the desire for respect and recognition through capitalization has been sought for decades.  W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, in the 1920s campaigned for ""Negro,"" &nbsp; when that was the preferred term, to be capitalized in publications. He even got The New York Times to change its style. His contribution, however, was essentially erased when the newspaper transitioned to using lowercase ""black.""  So, while it became clear that we would capitalize Black, what was   much foggier and contentious was what to do with ""white"" in reference to people who are racialized as white.  Other copy editors brought up equality as the main point in favor of capitalizing white. If Black is capitalized, some may believe that white should be capitalized as well  to do otherwise could imply bias.  Additionally, some have suggested   that leaving white   lowercase could create problems in its societal implications.      ""To not name 'White' as a race is, in fact, an anti-Black act which frames Whiteness as both neutral and the standard,"" Ann Thy Nguyn and Maya Pendleton wrote in the Center for the Study of Social Policy's explanation of why it capitalizes white. ""Moreover, the detachment of 'White' as a proper noun allows White people to sit out of conversations about race and removes accountability from White peoples and White institutions involvement in racism.""  AP has not made any change to its stylization of white, leaving it lowercase for now.  ""As a global news organization, we are continuing to discuss within the U.S. and internationally whether to capitalize the term white,"" Daniszewski wrote.  After much deliberation and research, we at The Bruin came to the conclusion to capitalize Black and leave white lowercase. Capitalizing white, we believed, is unlikely to be the solution to complacency among white people in racial injustices. Additionally, its ties to white supremacist groups in the capitalized form are too strong for us to be comfortable   adopting the same style.  While this could seem like unequal treatment, the fact is that white people and Black people have vastly different histories in America   that make the considerations that go into decisions of this kind less obvious and more nuanced.  Many Black people in America today are descendants of slaves who   involuntarily had their cultural history  including the country in which they were born  rendered indiscernible. They don't necessarily have the privilege many white people do of knowing their precise heritage and being able to be referred to specifically by the country their family   is from.  However, within these discussions, it is important to note   that at The Bruin, we only refer to someone's race if it is entirely relevant to the story we are reporting on. And, we always defer to how sources self-identify and try to be as specific as possible. For example, we wouldn't refer to a Somalian immigrant in the United States as a Black person, but as Somalian, unless they told us they identified as Black.  Language is ever-evolving. Every year, those of us at the Copy desk have to adapt to AP's new rules and decide which ones we agree with and best suit the community we serve.  That community we serve is ever-evolving, too. And in the future, it wouldn't be surprising if capitalizations of Black, white, etc. all fluctuate. But for now, we believe the most respectful and considerate step we can take is to listen to Black Bruins who are advocating for a capitalized Black.  Sure, our job in Copy does not involve directly reporting on   issues of racial inequality and injustice, but we still have an important responsibility in representing the Black community and righting wrongs where we can.",['cap-sara-hubbard'],"['copy-shop', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/11.9.quad_.copyshop.illoheader.NN_.png

UC, UC, youre no good, treat your workers like you should, chanted dozens of unionized employees outside the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Wednesday.    The strike at UCLA involved union members from American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299 and Teamsters Local 2010. AFSCME Local 3299 also held protests at medical centers at UC San Diego, UC Irvine  ,   UC Davis and UC San Francisco. Other unionized UC employees held virtual pickets Wednesday.&nbsp;    AFSCME Local 3299 is the UCs largest labor union, serving around 26,000 service and patient care workers across all 10 UC campuses. Teamsters Local 2010 represents about 14,000 UC and California State University administrative and clerical workers.&nbsp;    The UC    announced    April 2 it would not lay off career workers for COVID-19-related reasons until June 30. However, the UC has already told over 200 workers they will be laid off, and notified union leaders that it plans to lay off over 3,000 systemwide, said AFSCME Local 3299 spokesperson Todd Stenhouse.    UC campuses have less need for workers because of the shift to remote operations, and has had to lay off workers without on-campus work, said UC spokesperson Sarah McBride. Most of these layoffs are temporary, and the UC may rehire these workers once on-campus activities resume, she added.    The UC lost $1.54 billion from   mid-March to May because of the pandemic, McBride said.    The UC could use up to about $6 billion of $15.9 billion in several of its investment pools, according to a May    UC Coalition of Unions report   .    The UC has already used some of its investment funds to pay for pandemic-related costs, which include refunding students housing payments and reducing the volume of patients in hospitals, McBride said.    The UC cannot use its endowment funds due to pre-existing requirements that set how the funds are used, McBride said. The UC currently holds around $12.5 billion in university-administered endowments, according to the coalition report.    However, about $5.2 billion of the endowments are in unrestricted assets that could be used to offset pandemic-related costs, according to the coalition report.&nbsp;    California Gov. Gavin Newsoms revised state budget    proposal    also cut up to $372 million from UC funding. Additionally, the UC froze salary increases for staff and faculty, while UC chancellors took a    voluntary    10% pay cut.&nbsp;    In response to economic concerns, the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act gave about $550 million in funding to the UC and UC hospitals.&nbsp;    Teamsters Local 2010 spokesperson Tanya Akel said UCLA should use its reserve funding  ,   like the unrestricted assets, to prevent layoffs.    Many workers live in households in which they are the only ones working, and layoffs could be devastating to them and their families, said AFSCME Local 3299 member Rosalyn Williams, who attended the protest.&nbsp;    The Wednesday protest followed nearly three years of protests for a new labor contract, which the union approved earlier this year.&nbsp;    [Related link:    UC patient care and service workers ratify wage increases, more in new contract   ]    We stressed continuously for almost two and a half years to get this contract to make sure our jobs are secure, Williams said. And now they come to us, telling us that we're laying off 3,000 across the UC board. That's not good. They shouldn't be laying off anyone during the pandemic.    The newest layoffs will be   a step back on recent progress on labor issues, union members said.&nbsp;    The only way to make change in society and the University of California is for people to have their voices heard, Akel said. We will continue to have our voices heard, until they are heard. Were not going to stop.

Heres episode two of The Online Edition, which were calling The Creativity Show.

I read all my books. I caught up on all the good TV shows. I even caught up on all the podcasts I listen to when I go for walks. I had been struggling to find ways to fill my time  until I realized how much fun painting adult coloring books could be. Since then, Ive been trying to do one creative thing each day  even if that just means watching Phineas and Ferb be creative because Im too busy with other things.  Its helped me feel less bored  especially because coming up with something creative to do can feel like its own creative project sometimes. Its also helped me focus on some of the ways other people are expressing their creativity right now: be it putting together zoom concerts for their friends, finding new and innovative ways to virtually engage with people or creating new podcasts and YouTube shows for others to enjoy.  But its also shown me that sometimes, creativity can be hard, and sometimes its a lot easier to watch someone else do something creative than try and find the energy to do it yourself. Thats why our show today is all about the creative projects people have taken on during isolation.  From the Daily Bruin, this is ""The Online Edition."" Im Omar Said, and were calling this episode The Creativity Show. Stay tuned, were bringing you stories about UCLA, Minecraft, music and TV reviews, and cooking  and just what it all has to do with being creative.  &nbsp;   Does anyone remember what UCLA looks like?    Omar Said:  Page One: Does anyone remember what UCLA looks like? Being away from UCLA has left students taking virtual classes, missing friends and scattered across the globe. As a result, most Bruins arent able to walk around campus and take advantage of its views and historic buildings. But some students are trying to change that, block by block, as they build a one-to-one scale replica of UCLA in a communal Minecraft server. The server is run by co-administrators Noah Molloy and Chris Ko  both second year electrical engineering students  with funding from Bruin Gaming, a UCLA student organization. Heres Noah with more details.   Noah Molloy:  My name is Noah Malloy, I'm a second year electrical engineer. A UCLA Minecraft server has always been like a big ask from our community for a while because Minecrafts one of those, like, really ubiquitous games. Like everyone has Minecraft so it'd be a really great game to have everyone like kinda join in and play around other Bruins basically. So that's kind of why  that was the real impetus for us to launch it, I guess.   OS:  The server has gotten a bit of help from Sunny Yen, the co-founder and former president of Bruin Gaming, who also founded UCLA eSports.   Sunny Yen:  My name is Sunny Yen. I work at UCLA recreation. My official job title is eSports engagement coordinator. Basically anything to do with eSports at UCLA, gaming at UCLA  the odds of that coming from our office is pretty high. There was the one video that went super viral of a Japanese high school doing their graduation ceremony. They rebuilt their high school in Minecraft. And they did their graduation ceremony. And it was like, it was a joke when obviously, it's not like, an official (one). But it was for fun. And that went super viral. And then so suddenly, you see a lot of people going, Oh, we should do that for colleges now. Especially with, you know, the school shutdowns and all that kind of stuff. That was something that we started seeing on a Reddit page for UCLA. The community there was like, Oh, well, I want a Minecraft server. I want to build. I want to do something now that we have a lot more time.    NM:  I feel like when we're all kind of denied access to campus, our immediately  we immediately want to, like, recreate it so that we can go back in that sense. I know. One of the talking points was like, oh, because now we're doing all online classes like Commencement is going to be  and graduation is going to be  online. So were like, well, if the school is not going to give us graduation, we'll make our own graduation. so that was kind of like kind of like a half reason for why we decided to make campus.   OS:  But timing is also important  it helps that people are generally stuck at home right now.   NM:  The reason why we did it was, in this period of isolation of our campus, the community has really become disconnected. So we wanted to make UCLA community whole again, by reuniting the divided. We wanted to rebuild campus and so we decided the medium that we would rebuild UCLA in was through Minecraft because it had a lot, that sort of sandbox world that gave us a lot of tools, to recreate campus, but we needed a lot of help from others because our goal was to make a one-to-one scale replica of it.   OS:  One place the server has gotten help from others is its model of Schoenberg Hall, where the Herb Alpert School of Music is housed. Students of that school found out about the server and began working to recreate the building they normally spend all their time in.   Carmen Voskuhl:  My name is Carmen Voskuhl. I am a junior. So, yeah, I'm a, I guess a third year. And I am a music major, but specifically vocal performance. So pretty much I sing opera, and I'm also a math minor. But yeah, my friend ended up reaching out to me and she was like, oh, like they're making you know, a whole Minecraft replica of UCLA. Like, we should build Schoenberg, the Music Building. So, me and a bunch of voice majors pretty much used it to, you know, we could hang out and but then also like to make this, you know, pretty accurate version of Schoenberg.   OS:  While this is the most popular attempt at building UCLA within a Minecraft server, it isnt the only one. UCLA eSports once wanted to do the same thing  albeit with a different approach.   SY:  So, UCLA eSports when they started their own server, they were like, we want to, like do this very methodically, like, we want like, a leadership hierarchy with like foremen, like very traditional construction. But I think for us our focus was Who gives a crap? Just, its were building UCLA in Minecraft. This should be fun, you know, we're not here to set up a leadership hierarchy, and make people actually feel like this is a chore. So right now, obviously, some buildings are insane. And its just looking at them and it's just like, I don't know how you did that in Minecraft.    NM:  People just kind of come in and they contribute wherever they want to. I know like a lot of the South Campus is like, each individual building of South Campus has kind of been started and they're not necessarily joined together to kind of just floating around in space, just waiting to be joined together. But I've seen people like they'll add their own little touches to various buildings just to really polish certain features of buildings that might have been overlooked by the original builder or something like that.   OS:  But focusing on fun doesnt mean the Bruin Gaming server has completely forgotten accuracy. The people working on it still want to build a one-to-one model of UCLA  a replica that matches both UCLAs size and shape.   CV:  I think, it was Jazz, ended up finding somehow on Google, a floor map of Schoenberg. So we really tried to base it off of that. And I think even at one point, there was like a significant chunk of our map that was gone, so that was, that was not fun, and then we had to like readjust things. But other than that it's been pretty smooth sailing.   OS:  Of course, the server has had some issues. But fixing those issues has been just another part of the process for those involved in running it.   SY:  I think some of the most rewarding things that I've heard come out of what we've done is  okay, here's the thing: The server was the lagging. And so actually what happened was a lot of people were like, I will donate money to you to upgrade the server, because, like, I've met so many good friends through the server.   OS:  Aside from issues with lag, the server has also had to deal with players engaging in vandalism.   NM:  In the early days, you had a lot of people from UCI and UC Berkeley come in and try to like, destroy and damage a lot of the various buildings and landscapes. So that was like one of the things that we had to keep an eye out for. So the reason why they probably came is they're probably on the UCLA subreddit as well, because it's not a private forum. Anyone can view it. Anyone can go on it, and so the advertisements there are visible to anyone. That's why we had a lot of people from there come. In terms of how we knew it (was) from UCI and UCB, we can basically track where they're connecting from, and tell that they're from Irvine or from Berkeley. And we can see that oh, well, if they're near there, they're most likely that's the school they're going to.   OS:  Nowadays, people who want to build on the server need to request edit permissions using a UCLA email address, to help minimize vandalism. But its not just students using the server to virtually walk UCLAs halls. The server is widening access to the campus  or at least a facsimile of it.   NM:  Probably the most interesting thing that I found cool about this was the fact that a lot of the players on the server aren't actually UCLA students. They're usually like UCLA prospects. We had a lot of high school students actually come in and play. And it's cool because the Campus Recreation basically was online, sort of like a campus tour. And so we got to have, those kids got a lot of like opportunities to talk to UCLA students, got to, quote unquote, see campus, in person, since we did have that one-to-one scale.    SY:  Yeah, I've heard that there's a lot of really young, young guys and girls just walk around campus in there. Yeah, we have a lot of kids from Geffen Academy, but also just a bunch of random, people  13, 12 year olds who just joined the server because they want to taste the college life or they want to, I guess, interact and see what it's like to be a college student. And I'm just like, all power to you, man. Like this is the best thing to do for now.   OS:  All things said  this model of UCLA has given students something to work on or look at, but its also helped give them hope for the future and cope with the current situation.   CV:  Maybe it could be possible that future music majors could actually almost experience what it's like to be in those halls. But it's a creative outlet too, to be around them and still chat and just build the music library and stuff like that. It's honestly a good coping mechanism for all this chaos.  &nbsp;   Opinions on the Arts    OS:  Page Two: Opinions on the Arts. While some people are picking up new hobbies or learning new skills, assistant Opinion editor EJ Panaligan has been using his free time in another way. Hes used his skills as an opinion writer to recommend TV shows, movies, songs and albums that he likes to his friends on Instagram  something hes considered doing in one format or another for a long time. As we record this, hes posted 43 recommendations in total. With me now to discuss his recommendations is EJ, as well as assistant Arts and Entertainment editors Paige Hua and Brooke Cuzick, who just might add some of their own.   EJ:  So yeah, it's been really exciting, putting out these recommendations on Instagram and getting some of my thoughts out there. This is something I've wanted to do for a while, but with everybody stuck at home, it just felt right to share some recommendations since we all have some extra free time. And I figured that since the Arts editors normally sit at the desk right behind mine, Id invite some of them to come on with me.  The first recommendation I put on was the song Venice Bitch by Lana Del Rey. To this day, Im still not entirely sure what attracted me to this song or how it became my most listened to song of all time on Last.fm, which would be 417 scrobbles and counting, or about 2.75 days of my life, but I think I made an attempt to explain it in my recommendation. Its a song that embodies so many different feelings for me  Lana gives an interestingly somber reflection on some of the emotional peaks of a relationship, while also acknowledging that fleeting time turns those moments into distant memories. I think the length of the song and the instrumental progression, particularly the 5:50 mark onward with its booming guitar solo, this almost orchestraic feel of just extreme maximalism, thats all the work of Jack Antonoff who helped produce this track with Lana, and I think that part, in combination with the length of the song, really capures that theme of fleeting time extremely well, because it genuinely feels like this reflective, end-of-summer, end-of-the-good-times kind of song, and to me its both calming and trance-inducing in that sense. Its easily one of my favorite songs of all time and I could go on and on about it or, as Lana would put it, over and over, honey. That being said, Brooke, youre the music editor: How do you feel about it?   Brooke:  I really just think the song itself is too long. Im not even saying I dont like it, theres just too much of it. There are some really good songs, like Chlorine by Twenty One Pilots, that can take a longer-than-average song length and run with it to create multiple narratives as the song goes on, but this one doesnt do that. As a listener, I wouldve gotten the point if it was condensed into four minutes instead of nine.   EJ:  Another recommendation I had was the Hayley Williams song Simmer. Most know Hayley as the lead singer of Paramore, and fans know even better that Hayley has been hesitant throughout most of her career to release music away from the band. And although what she tried to avoid for the longest finally came to fruition, shes getting the best of both worlds. Her Paramore band members Taylor York and Zac Farro have production credits all over her upcoming album Petals for Armor, and I think Simmer was such a strong starting point for her solo work. When we last heard from Hayley and the rest of Paramore in After Laughter, that whole 80s pop aesthetic was in full swing, but lyrics of depression, loss of hope and hard times sharply contradicted the quirky dance-ability of that particular era of music that that album embodied. This time, the darker production matches the lyrics  Simmer boasting this brooding, rumbling bassline throughout as Hayley meditates on the complicated feelings surrounding anger and trying to keep it in control. This is another one of those songs that has that ability to just consume the listener like ""Venice Bitch"" has  it was very easy for me to just get lost in the instrumentation and Hayleys vocals, which were pretty amazing.   Brooke:  Yeah, I agree. Hayley Williams is doing exactly what artists should do when they separate and pursue solo projects. Each song she has released from her upcoming album Petals for Armor so far has offered incredible emotional nuance that steps just far enough away from her work in Paramore to stand on its own, but it doesnt shock listeners to the point where they wont want to listen.   Paige:  And while I love hearing you guys pop off with music recommendations, I'm gonna pop in with some screen-friendly recs as the Theater, film and television editor. So for anyone who is more of a movie person, like me, Ive been personally drawn to nature documentaries on Disney+ these days. After all, we cant go out right now, so might as well pretend you can immerse yourself in nature, right?   EJ:  Or, you can immerse yourself in political documentaries. Another recommendation I had was the recent Hillary Clinton documentary series that released on Hulu. As someone whos trying to learn a bit more and immerse myself into the world of politics, I really appreciated how thorough the documentary was in detailing Hillarys life story and her foray into the world of politics. It also chronicled some of the major events of her 2016 presidential campaign with some really intriguing behind-the-scenes footage, which I don't think has really been shown anywhere else before, and I found that to be a really cool tool in humanizing such a prominent political figure like Clinton. Ultimately, I really enjoyed how the documentary overall didnt lead into all the cheap drama and all the scandals that kinda plagued most of her political career. To me, this documentary just felt informative and intriguing and engaging, which is something that I think most documentaries should aim to do.   Paige:  Oh, speaking of intrigue and suspense, Ive been dabbling with unsolved murder mystery podcasts that I think you might be interested in. Your Own Backyard is a great one to start off with. And for anyone living in California, the podcast really brings the mystery to your own backyard. Set in San Luis Obisbo, the podcast has actually brought in new evidence to the missing persons case of Kristin Smart.   Brooke:  Yeah, I love this podcast, too. It hits especially hard because I am from San Luis Obispo County, so I grew up watching it all unfold. Since I was so young, the most I remember from it was the Missing Cal Poly Student sign outside of my dads work in the Village of Arroyo Grande, so its great that the podcasts host, Chris Lambert, goes into so much detail about all aspects of the investigation.   EJ:  So let's get into some of the TV shows I recommended. One of my favorite recommendations Ive done so far was Phoebe Waller-Bridges Fleabag. I think anyone who knows anything about me knows just how much I absolutely adore this show, and a lot of that adoration is in regard to Phoebes incredibly sharp pen. And while her acting is no joke  like some of her facial expressions are nothing short of amazing  her capacity for joke-writing, conversation-writing and scene-building is to me, just other-wordly. And that's the reason shes an incredibly hot name in the industry at the moment, and that reason resides within this show and all of the heart, and all of the humor and charisma that it encompasses.   Paige:  OK, I dont have Amazon Prime Video so I have yet to hop on the Fleabag bandwagon. But what I do have is Hulu, and if you love Phoebe Waller-Bridge, you have got to start watching Killing Eve. Or, if you dont have access to the show, feel free to keep up with the weekly recaps of the episodes weve been doing too on dailybruin.com. Its a completely different vibe but Phoebes dark humor underlies so much of the script, and I mean, come on, who doesnt love a female power couple?   EJ:  Speaking of powerful female leads, lets talk about Little Women, one of my more recent recommendations. This was one of my most anticipated films of last year because to me, Greta Gerwig quickly became a must-see director after Lady Bird, but this movie in particular showed off her capacity to take on a larger cast, a book adaptation and a period piece all at the same time, and handle it with absolute grace. But I know Brooke has a lot of thoughts about this one. Brooke?   Brooke:  Little Women was probably my favorite movie from last year. Even as someone who hadnt read the book before I saw the film, the emotional evolution of all of its characters left me thinking about it long after I left the theater  and led me to see it again the next week. It perfectly balances Jos grappling with her want for independence, which is unfortunately paired with her craving for companionship. Im torn when it comes to picking my favorite part of the movie, but Jos monologue where she talks about how women are more than just objects for romantic affection and then ends by accepting how lonely she really feels always leaves me in tears. Between that moment and her sister Amys struggle of feeling like she will always be second best to Jo, Little Women leaves me feeling extremely self-reflective. And as the self-proclaimed Amy of my family, I felt so seen.   EJ:  Yeah, just going off of what Brooke said, theres just a lot to love about this film. I found one of the final scenes in particular, in which Jo finally gets her book published, as one of the most poignant in the film  to me it was just this kind of a cathartic resolution to the emotional peaks and valleys that the narrative journey brings the viewers on leading up to it. I think much of the films success was to the credit of Gerwigs direction and screenwriting. She was able to adapt the classic Louisa May Alcott novel for the screen with a refreshing pair of eyes that ultimately made the film feel like her own. And I also recommended Gerwigs solo-directorial debut, Lady Bird, which Im sure hits close to home for Paige.   Paige:  As a native of Sacramento, you know I have to stan Greta Gerwig. I was able to watch that movie in the theater that was featured in the film. But that movie also came to me during a very transitional time in my life  just as I was getting ready to leave home for college. And that, combined with how familiar the setting of the film was for me, made it hit that much harder. I think Greta Gerwig made this amazing choice to focus on something that isnt seen much with college coming-of-age movies, which is the fact that sometimes, distance can improve the relationships we have at home. I certainly found that true for me, as I think my parents and I are the type of people to drive one another up a wall whenever we spend just a bit too much time together. Overall, Lady Bird is just a great movie to look back on, and other movies like it are always good tear jerkers. In fact, The Perks of Being a Wallflower recently started streaming on Netflix, and I just watched it the minute it came out. Parts of it didnt age as well as they could have, but it carries a great message about optimism for the future and boasts a wonderful soundtrack, which I think are two things we all need in our lives right now.   EJ:  Another coming-of-age-type movie I recommended was Olivia Wildes directorial debut Booksmart. I watched this movie from the hours of 3 to 5 a.m. over winter break and Im still in awe that I didnt wake up my family with all of my cackling. I thought this movie shared a lot of similarities to Lady Bird, particularly Beanie Feldstein having prominent but similar roles in both, but Booksmart I think leans more into the comedy as opposed to Lady Birds focus on the drama and emotion of the film. And I wouldnt even say the differences in tone are entirely distinct  I think both films do the comedy and drama combination incredibly well. You couldnt really go wrong with either  in fact, itd probably serve you well to do both.   EJ:  One of my more recent recommendations was Taylor Swifts False God. Ive been a Taylor fan on the low for most of my life, like I definitely remember singing along to Tim McGraw when I was like 5 or 6, but only in the past two years or so did I really buy into her talent and artistic vision, because she definitely has a lot of both. False God was an immediate standout during my first listen of Lover  to me, it was just so sonically different from any other Taylor song Ive heard before. The sensuality and maturity in her tone carries this incredibly smooth production combination of atmospheric synths, a slow-tempo beat and some well-placed saxophone moments. This song showed me that Taylor has an incredible amount of potential with this sensual, synth-R&amp;B-atmospheric pop sound, whatever you want to call it, and she needs to continue pushing this sound in the future, because she has a lot of potential at it.   Paige:  I definitely think False God is one of the best songs on Taylors new album. But, personally, I love diving into her old sounds with Speak Now and Red, even more. Those are two of her best albums in my opinion, and it doesnt hurt to return to some nostalgia in these uncertain times. God knows Ive been listening to my fair share of One Direction again, and, honestly, the choice couldnt have come at a better time. My 12-year-old self is screaming at the rumors that theyre getting back together for their 10-year anniversary. Of course, it all still seems quite up in the air, but for anyone who loved the boys as much as I did, SiriusXM Hits 1s Twitter account is popping off with their daily tea caps for this rumored One Direction reunion, and its a wonderful way to cure some boredom.   Brooke:  Yeah, I'm definitely excited about One Direction's possible comeback too, but kind of getting back to Taylor Swift. She's one of those artists that Ive loved since childhood, so obviously I loved Lover, but False God is probably the track I skip the most. I can definitely appreciate its diversion from Taylors usual sound and I like the horns that are featured on it, but its place on the track list between Soon Youll Get Better and You Need to Calm Down feels thematically jarring. After I listen to a song about her mother, I definitely dont want to listen to a sensual song about her and her boyfriend. Theres definitely a place for it on the album but she could have set it somewhere it would have continued the albums story more smoothly. There are albums like I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it by The 1975 that balance this really well, where every song tonally and sonically bleeds into the next; False God stops Lover from achieving the same thing.   EJ:  Alrighty then, Omar is letting me know that our time is almost up, so for my last recommendation I wanted to talk about King Princess 2019 album Cheap Queen. I think to me shes really this particularly exciting new artist in pop music, and she showed throughout this album that she can take on a wealth of different sounds and leave her mark on them incredibly well. And its not as if shes trying to have a sampler taste of all these sounds either, theres a lot of depth and evident effort put into embodying them. Whether its the synth-laden, anthemic Tough on Myself, or the infectiously disco Hit The Back, I think King Princess has firmly entrenched herself as a new artist to keep an eye on moving forward.   Paige:  Im a huge fan of King Princess too, but, honestly, whats most surprising to me is that I feel like she seems to be part of a large trend toward soft, chill soulful indie music. For me shes a blend of Rex Orange County and Oh Wonder, two artists that really epitomize that sort of cool, not-so-hidden, small artist music vibe people seem to be gravitating toward these days.   Brooke:  Yeah, I cant say that I listen to a lot of soft, chill music, but what I can say is that the band Waterparks has that same authentic, rising musician feel to it. I feel like the music industry has definitely been moving for a while in a direction where it feels trendy to listen to artists with a smaller following. I definitely play into that, and Im glad I found Waterparks before the band became too mainstream.   EJ:  Alright y'all. So listen, I really loved talking and hearing about all these songs and albums, different films and shows that we all admire for one reason or another. And I even the disagreements were fun. Thats kind of been my favorite part of sharing these recommendations on Instagram  I've been getting a lot of DMs in response to my stories, and I've been having little short discussions with people about whatever I recommended that day. And to me, that's the best part of doing this, to kinda like facilitate discussion about art that we love, art that we admire, and just hearing out the different reasons why we love what we love. And to me, especially during a time like this, I think it was really important to, for me to at least think critically about the things that I love and have that kind of discussion with others, even with people I haven't really heard from that often. So that was really nice. I really appreciated hearing some of your recs, it was incredibly fun to be part of Arts for a short while. Thanks, you two!   OS:  Yeah, its been great to hear what you all have to say. Thanks everyone!  &nbsp;   Daily Bruin says bon appetit    Omar Said:  Page Three: Daily Bruin says bon appetit. With people spending more and more time at home, Americans everywhere have taken up new experiments in cooking, be it working with starters and baking sourdough, learning basic cooking skills or trying new recipes. Staffers at the Daily Bruin arent immune  which has given rise to a new channel in our Slack workspace: DB Bon Appetit. Its given us a chance to share recipes and talk about our luck trying them out. With me today is Quad editor Molly Wright, whos going to bring us some recipes that she and other members of DB Bon Appetit cooked up at home.   Molly Wright:  Full disclosure, I started the DB Bon Appetit channel. Im a big fan of cooking and of the Bon Appetit Test Kitchen on YouTube, so I was looking for a way to share that with everyone at the office. Its been a big hit, and were all eager to share our recipes with you. Now, obviously, were all amateurs, but we had a lot of fun with this and it all turned out pretty well. Our first recipe comes from Kimia Azad, a Daily Bruin Quad contributor. Kimia is one of the most enthusiastic members of DB Bon Appetit, and shes excited to share her take on pasta with arrabiata sauce.   Kimia Azad:  Hi everyone, my name is Kimia, Im a contributor at Daily Bruins The Quad, and today I will be sharing with you guys my recipe for pasta with arrabiata sauce and a lemon drizzle.   Arrabiata sauce is a spicy sauce made from garlic, tomatoes and dried red chili peppers, cooked in olive oil. Im a big fan of spicy, but the amount of red chili peppers you add to your sauce is totally up to you.   The sauce calls for garlic, tomatoes and dried red chili peppers. My spicy flavor is coming from powdered red chili pepper, and Im substituting tomatoes for a canned tomato basil sauce. You can also use traditional Italian sauce or tomato sauce. Any pasta will do.   Im going to boil water in a pot, adding a dash of salt. Make sure to leave the pot uncovered.   Now that I am waiting for my water to boil, I can get started on my sauce. On medium heat, add a dash of oil to a separate pot. Once the oil has heated up, I will add 2 tablespoons of minced garlic, making sure to stir.   My garlic has been heating up and sizzling for a minute now, so Im going to add my seasonings. First, lower the heat of your pan. Im adding around a teaspoon of powdered red chili pepper to the pan. Im then sprinkling salt and pepper into my sauce.   After I add the seasonings to my sauce pot, I will add 3 cups of canned tomato basil sauce to the pot. Keep your sauce on a low heat and stir.   My water is now boiling, so Im adding six servings of rotini pasta to my water. Make sure to mix your pasta around so it doesnt stick to the pan. As my pasta cooks, Im going to check up on my sauce. Make sure to stir your sauce around as it heats up. Give your sauce a quick taste, add whatever you want. Im grinding up some more salt and pepper into my sauce.   Its now time to make the lemon drizzle. The lemon drizzle is totally optional, but I feel as though it helps lift the sauce and add flavor. The drizzle calls for lemon, salt, pepper and olive oil. I am juicing two lemons and mixing the juice to a dash of olive oil, salt and pepper into a sauceboat. And thats it for the drizzle, its really easy to make.   My pasta has been cooking for nine minutes now, it tastes done, so Im turning off the stove. Get a pair of tongs, and transfer your pasta into the saucepot. Naturally, some water will follow your pasta into the saucepot. The added pasta water will then help thicken your sauce. Keep your pot at a low heat, and continue mixing. Once your sauce and pasta are well incorporated, youre ready to serve. Add salt, pepper, parmesan or basil for garnish.   My pasta is done, and its pretty fresh and warm, and Im excited to eat it. Dont forget to add a splash of your lemon drizzle for flavor.   MW:  Up next is Andrew Warner, who was last years Quad editor. Hes vegan and he knows a lot about how to combine different ingredients to make food thats vegan and delicious. Here he is making a chickpea potato matzah stacker.   Andrew Warner:  Hi, my name is Andrew Warner and I am a Daily Bruin senior staffer, and today I will be just going through the pantry at my parents' house and seeing what we've got in the kitchen, seeing what I can cook and trying to figure out how to make a coherent dish out of it.   Im thinking what I can do is make a chickpea potato matzah stacker. I have a lot of matzah, which I think is probably going to go bad so I'm going to try to use that. I have a lot of herbs. I have garbanzo beans, or chickpeas, whatever you want to call them. I think I'm going to use those. Just a can of chickpeas and then I have some lemons, I have some potatoes. I'm thinking what I can do is do, maybe do like an herb vinaigrette-type thing with the lemons and the herbs, so I have chives, oregano and mint. And I was thinking I could do like a, I have some olive oil, too. So I was going to do like a, like a dressing with those, and then kind of roast the potatoes with maybe some dill and salt and pepper.   And then do this thing that I've been wanting to try with garbanzo beans. I saw a guy on YouTube. I don't remember his name. I don't even remember the video, but he made these fried garbanzo beans with garlic and spices that looked really good. So I think I'm going to do that and see if I can do it with the matzah. I think I'm going to try to do like a, like a stacker kind of like the flatbread stackers at B-Plate, and kind of toast the matzah a little bit and then stack everything on top of it and then pour the dressing over it.   So yeah, let's, let's get started. So the first thing I'm going to do is the potato, because that's going to take the longest to cook I think, since the garbanzo beans are already cooked, since they're in the can. So I just have a Yukon Gold potato, so I'm just going to slice that. I scrubbed it and cleaned it. And then I'm going to toss it with some olive oil and I have an oven preheating to 425 F, just because I think that's a good temperature to roast vegetables. It's what I always use. Yeah. So I'm going to cut it into bite-size cubes. Because I think that's like a good size. It will kind of complement the size of the garbanzo beans and they'll cook faster, which is, that's really what I want. I don't want to have to wait for an hour for this potato to cook.   OK, so I, the fresh herbs that I have are chives, mint and oregano, but I also have some dried dill and I think dill goes really well with potatoes and it goes really well with lemons, so I'm also going to use that. So this is just like a pinch of dill, a pinch of salt and like a half a tablespoon of olive oil, and one medium-size Yukon Gold potato. This is not like a big potato. So I have the potato and the dill and stuff. I have it on a baking sheet, I'm going to put it in the oven. I think I'm going to roast them for about 20 minutes, maybe 25. We'll see how things look. But I'm going to set the timer for 20 minutes.   And now I'm going to do the garbanzo beans. So this should be pretty simple. I basically, the, I'm opening the can right now. The video that I saw this guy, he took the can of chickpeas, he rinsed them and then he basically just toasted them in olive oil for a little bit, and so I'm just going to fry or like toast the chickpeas on their own and maybe add some salt and pepper and some paprika maybe. But we'll see. Let me rinse them first.   OK, and I also have three cloves of garlic that I'm going to add in while I toast the, the chickpeas. When, this is something that happens a lot with garlic, is if you cook it too hot or too much oil or if it's too fine, it burns really fast and it gets bitter and it's not very good. What I do, and this helps, is I don't, I don't chop the garlic, I don't, I don't slice it or do anything like that. I just crush it with a knife to peel it and then I crush it more times with the knife, so it stays in pretty big chunks of garlic so it doesn't burn as fast. It kind of softens up and it gets a little creamy, like when you roast garlic almost, but you're frying it now. So that's what I'm going to do here. I'm just going to crush it up with a knife a couple times.   OK, so I have a nice large nonstick pan. I'm going to add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil here, and then Im going to add in the garlic and start to heat it from the cold oil so that kind of, the garlic kind of steeps into the oil and it kind of infuses it with a nice garlic flavor. So I'm going to do that right now. I'm going to turn it up to, I'd say a medium high heat, so it doesn't burn.   All right. And then while it's heating, I will grab the chickpeas and let it get warm.   OK, so the oil is getting hot, I'm going to toss in the chickpeas. And then while I, while that was happening, I grabbed some paprika, some ground coriander and some cayenne pepper and then I'm also going to add some cumin to this and let the chickpeas and garlic kind of do their thing right now. And then I'll add in the seasonings in just a bit.   Alright, so I'm going to do a half teaspoon of coriander and a half teaspoon of paprika, and a full tablespoon of cumin because I think that's a really good flavor to go with chickpeas, and then I'm going to add just like a really small pinch of cayenne pepper, because I don't want it to be spicy but I want it to have a little kick, like a very tiny kick.   OK, so the chickpeas are starting to get a little bit crispy, so I'm going to add in the spices now. The garlic is not burning, and these have been going on medium high heat for about five minutes now. So if I had used a garlic press, I think these probably would have just been burnt to a crisp by now. So I also forgot, I'm going to add a little bit of salt, just to taste. I like my food on the saltier side, generally. I think everybody likes salty food, but I like my food to be especially salty, yeah. OK, so while the chickpeas are going, I'm going to make a quick lemon herb vinaigrette with what herbs I have. And that should be really quick. So I'm just going to chop those up right now and then juice the lemon.   OK, so I just finished chopping up the herbs. I have about half a cup total of finely chopped herbs. You can really use like whatever you have for this, I think. I have, like I said, I have mint, oregano and chives. And I just kind of use them in equal parts. There might be a little more mint, because I like mint more. So yeah, I'm going to add the juice of two lemons  oh, the potatoes are ready. So I'm going to add the juice of two lemons and some olive oil to the herbs and that'll be kind of like a vinaigrette.   OK, so the potatoes and the chickpeas are all done. I'm just going to add some oil to this vinaigrette, which right now is just lemon juice and herbs. And then I'm going to whisk that all together and then stack it all on top of the matzah, and I think we should be good to go.   Yeah, the potatoes taste really good, the chickpeas taste good and I'm sure the vinaigrettes going to taste good. So it should be a really good meal, a really nice dinner.   All right, so I'm just going to take one matzah, one square matzah, and these are pretty decent sized. Yeah, they're square. And then I'm going to, first I'm going to add the potatoes, I think. Then I'm just going to add some of those chickpeas and then drizzle over a little bit of vinaigrette, and it should be ready to eat. The chickpeas did actually get fairly crispy, by the way. I was kind of surprised. Not as crispy as they would in the oven. But they're like  they have a very good texture that I appreciate because they're crispy, but they're still a little creamy inside, which is perfect. Now I'm going to pour over some of this dressing, and then it's ready to eat. I don't want to add too much of this vinaigrette, because I think if I do, it's going to get, it's going to get to the matzah, and the matzah is going to get soggy and gooey, which I don't really want, so I'm just going to add a very thin application of this dressing and try to get a little bit more herbs than I do get actual vinaigrette.   Alright, now time to taste it. Matzah is holding up better than I thought it would, and it's very delicious. That's delicious. Truly, truly impeccable. No, but it's really tasty. The chickpeas are really good, the matzah is good, the potatoes are good. Everything is nice. If I had more time. I would have toasted the matzah maybe. But other than that, this is a really good meal. A nice, quick dinner. And yeah, everything tastes really good. It looks pretty, and yeah: Yeah. This is a nice chickpea potato matzah stacker.   MW:  So funnily enough, our next recipe comes from me. Like I said, Im really into cooking. I decided to make a recipe my family has been using for a long time: chicken tikka masala. We all love Indian food, but I think British-Indian food is a close second, too. Here goes.   MW:  Hi, Im Molly Wright, the Blogging editor for the Daily Bruin, and I am making my familys version of chicken tikka masala today. Its just my familys adaptation of a recipe my mom found on Pinterest, and weve been making it ever since.   Step one: Cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces and put them in the pan   Next, marinate the 1-inch pieces with 2% Greek yogurt, garam masala spice, fresh lemon juice, black pepper and ground ginger.   Move on to a tomato base sauce. In this sauce, we include minced garlic, julienned red peppers, heavy cream, chickpeas and 1 tablespoon each of cayenne pepper, garam masala spice, paprika and turmeric.   After marinating the chicken for about 30 minutes or more, add the tomato base sauce to the marinated chicken, where we simmer on low for up to four hours on the stovetop.   After simmering on low for at least two hours, we prepare a box of jasmine rice according to the package instructions.   Finally, take the chicken off the stovetop, serve it with the jasmine rice and there you go.   MW:  Finally, heres Kristin Snyder, the Daily Bruin Arts editor. She decided to take on dessert and bake lemon sugar cookies. Lets see if shes up to the task.   Kristin Snyder:  Hi, Im Kristin Snyder, the Daily Bruins Arts editor, and today, were making Bon Appetits lemon sugar cookies.   For the cookie itself, youll need 3/4 cup of sugar, half a cup, or 1 stick, of unsalted butter at room temperature, one large egg, 2 tablespoons of finely grated lemon peel, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour. For the optional icing, Im pulling from Bon Appetits lemony slice-and-bakes recipe, which calls for 1 1/4 cups of powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice.   First, youll want to preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and then youll want to combine the first six ingredients in a large bowl using an electric mixer.   And once all of those are well-combined, youll beat in the flour.   Afterward, youre going to want your dough to be firm but not overly hard, so youll want to chill it for what the recipe calls for two hours  personally, it only took about 30 minutes to reach that state.   Once your dough is chilled, youll take about 1 tablespoon at a time and shape it into balls, and youll place them about 2 inches apart. And then youll take a glass or a measuring cup and youll flatten each of the cookies until theyre about 2 inches round. And then you will bake them for roughly 14 minutes. Youll know theyre done once the bottoms are golden brown, and youll take them out to cool.   As your cookies are cooling, you can start working on the icing, which is pretty simple. All you have to do is whisk the powdered sugar and the lemon juice in a small bowl. If you find that the mixture is too thick, all you have to do is add in a bit more lemon juice. Typically by half teaspoons, but you can add more if you would like  that will make sure that the mixture loosens up a bit  and you can also add in food coloring if you so desire.   Now for the taste test: Overall, the cookie itself isnt too lemony which is why I think the icing does a really good job of adding that extra pizazz that elevates it from being a pretty typical sugar cookie. Its fairly sweet, it makes for like a fun treat once in a while, but you wouldnt want to eat more than one or two at a time.   OS:  Thanks, Molly. Ill be sure to keep an eye out for those recipes.  &nbsp;   Checking in with the family    Omar Said:  Page Four: Checking in with the family.

And like you, Im aimlessly scrolling on Facebook, even though there hasnt been anything new to see on there since 2015, probably. But honestly, Im enjoying the sunshine and the mild weather here before it becomes an inferno, and constantly wondering when theyll lift the stay at home in Illinois. The dates keep shifting, as does the data, and theres so much uncertainty surrounding it all. But until then, Im relying on true crime biographies and comedy shows to keep me sane.    Jeong Park:  Hi, Im Jeong Park. I was the managing editor for Daily Bruin 2015-2016, assistant News editor 2014-2015 and a senior staff 2016-2017. Now I work at a local newspaper for the Orange County Register, out of Anaheim. But right now, Im in my home in Long Beach, California, about seven blocks from the ocean, so Im getting a nice breeze here. What I do right now in my free time? Not so much productive stuff. Playing a lot of Civ-V, which is a phenomenal video game, but also a huge time suck. Lot of doom-scrolling on twitter, trying to find the latest news thats going to make me depressed or upset or mad or whatever it is. Watching some Korean variety shows and sitcoms and catching up on some things that I missed. Lot of just scrolling Facebook which is not productive at all. I pretend that its for work, but it is really not for work, it is just a way to kill time. I do try to get some fresh air. I mean I go outside, take walks a couple times a day. I drive around to random places once a week. I went to Hemmet last week, and I went to - where did I go to - I think I went to Malibu the week before - just as a way to kill time. I dont go outside my car - i just get in my car, put on my gas pedal, drive and come back. Its (a) waste of money, but also its kind of fun, and its good to get some outside breeze once in a while. But, you know stay safe, really okay, I hope. And yeah, hoping things go okay.    Ani Gasparyan:  Hello, Im Ani Gasparyan, I graduated from UCLA in 2019. I was an assistant Opinion editor and editorial board member at the Daily Bruin from 2018 to 2019, and an Opinion columnist the year prior. I currently work as a news reporter at Beverly Hills Weekly, where I cover Beverly Hills, Beverlywood and Los Angeles. During quarantine, Im actually still going to work since newspapers have been labeled essential and were a small office. My commute has improved though, since it used to take me two hours to get to work and now it takes less than 40 minutes. At work, Ive been writing lots of articles on the virus, for instance how small businesses have been impacted by mandatory closures and how the pandemic is affecting the school district. Things were slow at first since a lot of city activities were understandably canceled, but now a lot of groups have started live-streaming their virtual meetings and finding ways to continue their business amid the pandemic. Other than work, though, Ive been spending more time with family when Im home, catching up with friends and watching TV shows.    Rupan Bharanidaran:  Hi, my name is Rupan Bharanidaran. I was the News editor at the Daily Bruin during the 2017 to 2018 academic year. Like most Americans, and really most people around the world, Im working from home. I work for an accounting firm doing tax returns and other tax-related work, and Im lucky enough that I can do my work virtually. I dont have to go out and go to an office or go to a store or anything like that. I can do anything I need to do from my computer at home, so Im lucky enough for that. But you know, its not easy of course, being socially distant, but I guess we dont really have much of a choice. I spend more time now with my family. I live with my parents, so I hang out with them, watch Netflix. I do yoga with them, so thats one, I guess, positive of staying at home all the time. But other than that, I dont have much going on with my life. Im just, taking it one day at a time and hunkering down and hoping for the best and hoping that this situation doesnt last too long, and hopefully if we all comply with the social distancing guidelines this wont last much longer. Anyway, keep staying at home and keep maintaining social distancing, and thank you.    Sara Randazzo:  Hi, Im Sara Randazzo. Im a 2008 graduate. I wrote for the Arts and Entertainment and Sports sections and was a copy editor back at the Bruin. Quarantine life has been interesting for me because I had a baby in January, and so Ive been on maternity leave this entire time. And so, in a lot of ways, the start of quarantine felt like the beginning of maternity leave: Real clothes were optional, it was hard to get out of the house every day or accomplish much because of having a newborn around. So, in a way, I feel very lucky because Ive just been able to play with my baby, whos now three-months old, and fully devote my time to him while being at home. And its even been a little bit nicer because now my husband is home working from the kitchen table and so he can see our son whenever he wants instead of being stuck on a train for an hour and a half coming home from Culver City, which is what hed been doing before. So, Im trying to, you know, count ourselves lucky and be grateful. I know that a lot of people have it a lot worse than we do. So for me, quarantine life equals baby life, and Im enjoying it for now. Good luck everyone.   OS:  Thats our show. Well be back again soon with another episode of The Online Edition.

But standardized testing isn&#8217;t going anywhere if the UC can help it.   The Board of Regents voted to suspend standardized testing in the UC admissions process May 21, following dozens of other schools in the decision.   But unlike Amherst College, Vassar College and Williams College &#8211; all of which have dropped standardized testing in admissions &#8211; the UC will attempt to create a new, system-specific test by 2025. If they fail to do so, standardized testing in UC admissions will be scrapped altogether.   COVID-19 has acted as a catalyst for change in many sectors. Considering the conversation around standardized testing and educational inequity, it&#8217;s no surprise that the UC took this moment in history to reconsider its approach.   What their new approach is, though, remains unclear.  The UC may or may not be right to cut the ACT and SAT from the admissions process &#8211; but if it&#8217;s going to put standardized testing on the chopping block, it needs to do so definitively. The decision to pour resources into creating a standardized test for the UC isn&#8217;t just an unnecessary addendum to an otherwise clear decision, it&#8217;s a waste of resources at a time the University doesn&#8217;t have much to spare.  Beyond that, an entirely new test provides a laundry list of foreseeable issues, specifically regarding financial and geographic accessibility.  A test is a test is a test. And even a world-class research university can&#8217;t fix the underlying issues the ACT and SAT have long faced &#8211; not because of poor design, but because of the inherent flaws with standardized testing.  The financial barriers within standardized testing aren&#8217;t going away &#8211; they&#8217;ll just be taking on a new form. Standardized testing, even from the UC, will likely require registration fees and costs to administer that will come out of students&#8217; pockets.  There&#8217;s no guarantee a UC-specific exam will be any more accessible. International students might know this better than anyone. Even in the largest cities abroad where students are aiming to take well-established exams like the SAT and ACT, testing centers can be extremely limited. If students struggle to find centers that provide tests that have been around for decades, distributing a UC exam might end up pushing away applicants from all over the world.  Not that the UC is even in the position to be creating a new test amid a pandemic and a catastrophic higher education budget. The UC was hit with  $558 million  in unanticipated costs from the coronavirus crisis, and the state&#8217;s education budget has limited room for even the bare necessities at the moment. Spending drastically limited resources on an exam that isn&#8217;t guaranteed to benefit students &#8211; or even be implemented &#8211; is a cost no one can afford.  Granted, it&#8217;s not a bad idea to have a backup plan if a testless world goes wrong. But besides that being unlikely, the UC could have used what it already had at its disposal &#8211; that is, the long standing testing models with existing infrastructure &#8211; instead of planning to spend five years trying to beat an unbeatable problem.  They may be valiant in their efforts.  But the only way to beat the problem at this point is to let it go entirely.

Q:  Is there a link between environmental issues and the COVID-19 pandemic?   A:  Habitat destruction, wildlife markets and climate change may be linked to zoonotic spillovers like the one that's caused the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the link between biodiversity loss and the pandemic is less clear.  SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a zoonotic virus that likely came from horseshoe bats in China, said Amandine Gamble, a postdoctoral researcher in the Lloyd-Smith Laboratory at UCLA.  Zoonotic viruses spread from exclusive animal hosts to humans in a zoonotic spillover event, said Thomas Smith, an ecology and evolutionary biology professor at UCLA.  Zoonotic disease outbreaks are a result of increased contact between humans and wild animals due to processes like deforestation and habitat destruction, Gamble said. For example, if fruit trees in the forest disappear because of deforestation, bats are more likely to go into peoples gardens to feed on cultivated fruit trees, creating opportunities for more zoonotic spillovers between wild animals and humans, she said.  A  2007 study  by University of Hong Kong researchers warned that horseshoe bats naturally house viruses similar to SARS-CoV and the practice of eating wild animals in southern China was a time bomb for the reemergence of another SARS-like virus.  This study was published after the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. Thirteen years later, the COVID-19 outbreak happened.  It is unclear how SARS-CoV-2 started infecting humans, but researchers think an intermediate host enabled the transmission from bats to humans, Gamble said.  A popular theory for the SARS-CoV-2 intermediary is pangolins, which are common in Chinas wildlife markets, but there is little evidence to support this theory, Gamble said. The virus detected from the pangolin was closely related, but not the same as the one responsible for the pandemic, she said.  These types of spillover events are not exclusive to coronaviruses. Henipaviruses, another type of virus found in fruit bats, are transmitted directly from bats to humans in Bangladesh through the palm sap they drink, Gamble said. In Malaysia, henipaviruses are transmitted from bats to pigs in pig farms while the bats eat fruits there, and people get infected by the pigs, she added.  Wildlife markets are also a hotbed for transmission, since wild animals from all around the world are put in small cages in close proximity to each other, Smith said. Animals defecate on each other and are often slaughtered next to each other, creating optimal conditions for the transfer of the virus from one animal to another, he said.  The link between biodiversity loss and zoonotic spillovers is less clear. Biodiversity loss can broadly be defined as the decrease in the number and variety of species. The Earth is currently undergoing its sixth mass extinction event, caused by human factors, according to a study supported by the National Autonomous University of Mexico and Stanford University.  It remains unclear whether the extinction event and zoonotic spillovers are correlated.  We dont know if having more species actually creates a better environment for the virus to replicate and evolve. ... So you could think that having more biodiversity will result in more zoonotic spillover events, Gamble said. But theres also what we call a 'dilution effect'  the more species you have available for parasites, the less likely it will end up in humans.  However, zoonotic spillovers are ultimately hard to detect, making it difficult to quantify the correlation between biodiversity and spillovers, she added.  When speaking about biodiversity loss and habitat destruction, it doesnt take long for climate change to enter the conversation, Smith said. As the planet warms, both humans and animals move to cooler places, he said.  It means theres going to be a lot more mixing  animals going to places where they havent been before, and humans as well, Smith said. From a pandemic standpoint, I think theres the potential to see much more spillover of these sorts of diseases. Thats sort of the hook between climate change and pandemics.  There have been reports of improved air quality as a result of decreased human activity during the pandemic. However, when carbon emissions dropped sharply after recessions in the past, they rebounded and negated any short-term decrease in emissions, according to an article by BBC Future. To achieve any long-term effect, there needs to be large changes, such as a move toward clean energy, according to Glen Peters of the Center for International Climate and Environment Research in Oslo.  I think as soon as theres a vaccine discovered, people are going to go back to driving their cars and doing as much as they did before, Smith said. The hope is that this pandemic will be a wake-up call to people to think about how theyre changing the climate and the biodiversity that we all depend on.",['cap-lauren-man'],"['news', 'science-health']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/Covid19diversity.jpeg

Just this week, the Daily Bruin&#8217;s upper management announced that the Daily Bruin would  cease print production  through the end of the 2019-2020 academic year, in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.   After all, it doesn&#8217;t really make much sense to print 6,000 copies of a student newspaper every day when most of the student body  has left campus  and instruction is entirely remote.   Originally, management&#8217;s plan was to cease printing until April 10 in line with the school&#8217;s  initial plans  to return for in-person instruction by week three. But the ever-changing nature of the pandemic has lead to the extension of remote instruction and, consequently, the extension of digital-only production for the Daily Bruin.  The Daily Bruin staff had to make a similar decision regarding print production back in the 1940s, when the United States entered World War II. In April's updated letter from the editors, The Bruin's upper management notes that this is the first time since World War II that the paper has ceased to be printed five days a week. However, this is the first time in our entire history that the paper has ceased printing entirely &#8211; during the war, the paper continued printing three days a week, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  While the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on The Bruin certainly draws parallels to that of World War II, the situation necessitated different responses in the way the paper scaled back its print production. The response to the current situation came relatively swiftly, but in the 1940s, the shifts in the paper&#8217;s production cycle were much slower and evolved throughout the course of the war.   As UCLA alumnus George Garrigues noted in his  history of the Daily Bruin , the U.S. entered World War II right around the same time students were gearing up for finals. Late in the evening on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, the paper&#8217;s staff scratched its original layout for Monday&#8217;s front page and replaced it with a number of articles about the bombing of Pearl Harbor from the United Press wire service with the bold-faced headline &#8220; Japan Declares War! &#8221;  Print production didn&#8217;t slow down right away. Through the end of the semester &#8211; this was  decades before  the university switched over to the quarter system, of course &#8211; Garrigues writes that &#8220;war news blanketed The Bruin&#8217;s front page.&#8221;  The paper did produce a shortened version on Dec. 11 &#8211; this was, however, unintentional. During wartime, governments across the world used to impose &#8220; blackouts ,&#8221; during which lights would be shut off for short periods of time, in an effort to prepare for potential attacks as well as to make it more difficult for bombers to navigate urban areas that would normally be well-lit at night. Garrigues writes that the first U.S. blackout of the war struck Southern California on Dec. 10, 1941 and the Daily Bruin editors had to publish a shortened three-page paper, composed of a broadsheet front page and two compact tabloid pages following it.  &#8220;Due to the loss of time during last night&#8217;s blackout the Daily Bruin today appears in a form unique in the annals of journalism &#8211; a three-page paper,&#8221; wrote the then-Editor-in-Chief Malcolm Steinlauf  on the front page of the paper .  It wasn&#8217;t until 1943 that the paper&#8217;s print format began to change for good. As staffers were drafted into the war, the size of the staff shrank, and so did the paper.  On Jan. 4, 1943 , The Bruin switched from the lengthy broadsheet layout it had been printing for decades before &#8211; and as it is typically printed today &#8211; to a smaller tabloid one, comparable in size and shape to that of papers like LA Weekly.  Later that year, the paper shifted to printing only three times a week. Following the publication of the paper&#8217;s 1943 Registration Issue, The Bruin began publishing three times a week during the week of July 5 (Interestingly, The Bruin only publishes a paper once a week during summer sessions nowadays).  In terms of wartime content, Garrigues notes that The Bruin took a largely liberal stance, with especial opposition against the internment of Japanese Americans; conservative groups &#8211; in particular, those investigating communism at UCLA &#8211; did not look upon The Bruin favorably. Then-dean Earl J. Miller even went as far as saying that UCLA would be better off without a school newspaper entirely, Garrigues writes.  Luckily, Miller didn&#8217;t get his way &#8211; as we all know, the paper survived opposition from conservative admins and readers. Following the end of the war, the paper resumed daily production, and has consistently published five days a week since fall of 1945. Until today, that is, when the pandemic once again puts us in a situation in which print production is not in the best interest of our students or staff.  Fortunately for the UCLA community, we&#8217;re living in an age in which cutting print production doesn&#8217;t hold quite the same weight that it would have in the 1940s &#8211; had the Daily Bruin&#8217;s then-upper management decided to cease printing the paper entirely, it's possible there would have been no Daily Bruin at all. It goes without saying that temporarily switching to a digital-only media source would have been, well, impossible without any sort of internet to get things going.  While reading Daily Bruin stories online might not have the same novelty as picking up a paper and skimming through it on your daily walk to class, it's a reminder that we're all going through different adjustments to the current pandemic and doing our best to get through this safely and sanely. Just like The Bruin returned full-time in 1945, the paper's staff is excited to come back to Kerckhoff Hall 118 and get the printers running once it's safe to do so again &#8211; whenever that may be.

Composed of   both students and alumni, participants in the project were randomly separated into groups of four to work on their own   original track. Each band   was provided with the same backing drum track created by the club's co-president, Dylan Coe. With this foundation, each group member layered their own instrumental   or vocal contribution to pass along to the next member until a full song was produced. Graduate student   Martha Kriley said Telephone Jams granted her an interactive way to maintain her connection to music   during the pandemic.   &#8220;Music has always been a big part of how I relax and express myself, so finding a way to do that during virtual learning and social distancing was really important for me,&#8221; Kriley said.   As a vocalist, Kriley said   she wrote the song and recorded the   lyrics. After hearing what her bandmates had added before the track reached her, she said the track's dreamlike tone served as lyrical inspiration. The   song&#8217;s title   ""Sun Glitter"" refers to the effect of the sun when it hits the water, which Kriley said   underlined the surreal tone   of the music and lyrics.  The hypnagogic   style she strived for hopefully allows listeners   to escape the chaos of the pandemic by imagining themselves somewhere else, Kriley said.   [Related Links:    UCLA Music Club bands together hobbyist and seasoned artists, creates community   ]   Contributing to the imaginative tone was Kriley&#8217;s bandmate, alumnus Justin Loera who said he saw Telephone Jams as an opportunity to share his music with the UCLA community. Loera was the first of his group to add to the track, and he   said his contribution was inspired by Fleetwood Mac. His guitar layer utilizes similar chords as those played by the band's lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, which encouraged Loera's group to follow in his footsteps with the song's dreamlike tone. Although Loera said he was able to produce his musical contribution in his ministudio at home, not everyone involved had the same advantage.  &#8220;The hardest part about Telephone Jams is since everybody's at home, not everyone has access to the same equipment,"" Loera said. ""The sound quality is going to vary a lot depending on different people and what they have available to them.&#8221;   While   the sound quality could be perceived as an issue, alumnus   Sinan Cem Cetin, said the variability is   exciting   because of the mystery of the final product's sound. Because he was first in his group to hear the track, Cetin said he was able to experiment with his sound. He initially dipped into the sounds of jazz but realized   the genre's style did not fit the drum track's rhythm. After trying various styles, he said he decided to go for a garage rock approach, characterized by the bashing of guitars.  &#8220;Because I went first, I   didn't know what other people are going to record on top of my track,"" Cetin said.   ""It's pretty exciting to hear what even happened to the guitar part and what they came up with.&#8221;    [Related Links:    Band Night allows students to explore new musical sounds in stress-free environment   ]   Though Kriley said Telephone Jams are an innovative way to make music, there are some disadvantages to this process of composing music. Kriley said   Telephone Jams lack   the   back-and-forth aspect of collaboration, as each person adds their own part without much input from others. Similarly, Loera said he values sitting in a room with other musicians to bounce off lyrical and musical ideas while songwriting, but   for now, Telephone Jams are the closest way to   work together musically  .    However, while the members are not interacting in person, graduate student Swapnil Sayan Saha said producing work with people from diverse musical backgrounds adds to the project's thrill. Every member has their own distinctive sound, and the activity allows the musicians to put their own touch   on a shared piece while still working collaboratively.       ""We talked about our process and what we all liked about each other's tracks, so that was a really great way to bring that social and collaborative aspect back to the process,"" Kriley said. ""It's a great way to just get away from our typical studies and collaborate on something else.""

I&#8217;m an unapologetic fan of silver linings and signs from the universe &#8211; often nonexistent ones.   But, as much as I hate to publish this sentiment, one of the many truths about my Daily Bruin experience is that it tested my capacity for optimism like never before.  To address the elephant in the room, I&#8217;ll say at the outset that one of the key instances I&#8217;m referring to is the 2019  strike  against UCLA&#8217;s Communications Board. When about half of our active staff jumped ship, innate hope didn&#8217;t come as easily as it usually does. By continuing to publish, I was standing against some of my closest friends and pissing off staffers I&#8217;d never even spoken to, all while taking on an unprecedented amount of responsibility. The understandable state of polarity within the newsroom made it difficult to follow my instincts &#8211; how could one best go forward?  Step one was to stomach the troubling reality that there would never be a perfect solution in response to that fateful endorsement hearing. We had to work with the damage left behind.  But the primary essence of Daily Bruin, and any respectable newspaper, is to keep its community informed. And so I was decidedly more concerned with doing right by our readers than I was with the ongoing fight against the board over a bylaw we&#8217;d already consented to as a collective staff.  I recognized from the get-go that my stance was a controversial one, but I received no shortage of reminders in the strike&#8217;s aftermath. Pokerfaced as I may seem &#8211; which my contributors have teased me about at every possible opportunity &#8211; it&#8217;s not easy walking into the newsroom you once called home, only to feel unwelcome for doing what you knew was the right thing. But where bridges were burnt between staffers, new bonds rose from the ashes.   Like I said, silver linings.  The strike, with the onslaught of negativity, also brought me a renewed sense of integrity and competence &#8211; something of marked importance given my struggle with the notion that I wasn&#8217;t good enough as an editor, journalist and human being. Leading the Arts section came with the constant pressure to be perfect, and consequent self-criticism. Marginally missing Copy's deadline twice in the same week would send me spiraling. Having to reprimand a writer made my heart clench with guilt and minor corrections that I had no way of preventing would keep me awake during unholy hours of the night. (Fortunately, those hours corresponded with daytime in Madrid, where  Pablo Mu&#241;oz , a precious newsroom friend, was studying abroad and simultaneously playing therapist.)  It took constant recalibration and weekly reminders from my boss, former Editor-in-Chief  Jacob Preal , to accept that my legacy would be based on the big picture, not the unfavorable minutiae that are inevitable in student journalism. After all, we&#8217;re just a bunch of kids trying to keep it together like adults.   Only after noticing some 30 gray hairs on my head did I finally settle upon different metrics to measure myself &#8211; my conviction to stand on the side of publishing, for one, or even the way my contributors would confide in me about their non-newsroom issues.  I was fortunate enough to establish these close connections with my writers, each of whom taught me something about journalism, the arts or simply about life. Coming full circle felt important, seeing as I flourished under the mentorship of former Arts editors  Lindsay Weinberg  and  Nate Nickolai , who continued to provide me with counsel even after they went on to write for the Hollywood Reporter and Variety, respectively.  They fall into my category of silver linings, as does former Music   | fine arts    editor  Andrew Warner,  who gave me so much to smile about throughout our stressful editorship. With us was former Lifestyle editor  Linda Xu , my close confidante and the final authority on the dress I wore to the  Oscars , representing Daily Bruin at the red carpet for the first time in its 100 years of publishing.  Better yet, I was able to pursue a passion project on the cultural and cinematic impacts of Marvel&#8217;s "" Black Panther  .""  As my beloved colleague  Alexandra Del Rosario  once told me, this story is the gift that keeps on giving; she was referring to the awards this piece sent my way, but I am even more thankful for the opportunity I had to speak with some of my cinema idols. Understanding their storytelling process shaped my creative sensibilities profoundly, sparking the life-altering realization that I didn&#8217;t want to be a journalist but rather a producer of similarly meaningful films.  As I set out to do just that, I realize this journey would be impossible without my spontaneous decision to join Daily Bruin as a freshman. If the takeaway from my senior column is the clich&#233;d &#8220;glass is half full&#8221; spiel, then so be it. The windowless newsroom of Kerckhoff 118 &#8211; complete with its leaking pipes, littered coffee cups and indecent wall quotes &#8211; built me from the ground up into who I am today. In this organization, I found not only myself, but also the fiercest friends, including one who doubled as a leader I&#8217;d follow into journalism&#8217;s jaws of death.  And so, here&#8217;s another truth about my Daily Bruin experience &#8211; the most important one, perhaps. Depending on where you&#8217;re standing, these four years can technically be represented by a splash of silver on a canvas that&#8217;s largely painted in gray.  But I&#8217;m inclined to believe it&#8217;s the other way around.

Council meetings take place every Tuesday at 7 p.m. and are open to all students. Spring quarter meetings will take place virtually on Zoom; links for the meetings can be found on the internal vice presidents Facebook  page . Watch a livestream of the meetings on the  USAC Live! channel  on YouTube.   Public comment     	 Sithara Menon, a third-year biology student and chair of the UCLA chapter of the California Public Interest Research Group, said the group has shifted to remote meetings and will focus on its New Voters Project campaign for spring quarter. The goal of the project is to make voting for the United States presidential race easy and accessible. The group plans to make absentee ballots available so students do not have to risk their health and safety to vote.     Special presentations     	 USA Election Board chair Navi Sidhu said his office is working on finding opportunities for online election events through Ballotpedia, Zoom and additional websites. Sidhu asked the council to approve Regulation 4, which implements temporary guidelines that will expire at the conclusion of the spring election to regulate the online election. He added that 35 candidate applications were submitted, and all noncommission offices are contested. This means that each position has a prospective candidate, and there will likely be no special election in the fall.     Agenda     	 The council approved the addition of Regulation 4 to the Social Media Guidelines for the election. The regulation specifies that candidates who use novel social media platforms or online media without approval from the election board may be subject to suspension from campaigning.   	 The council approved a proposal for the election board to use $10,000 from USAC to purchase gift cards to help incentivize voter turnout.   	 The council approved the ballot for the upcoming USAC election. Students can vote from May 4-8 on MyUCLA.   	 General Representative 3 Brandon Broukhim allocated $690 from his office to Books for Bruins, a USAC group.   	 The council allocated a total of $544.34 from Supplemental Fund for Service to a non-USAC group.   	 The council appointed Jenny Wang, a second-year economics student, as Finance Committee vice chair.     Reports     	 President Robert Watson said his office has had weekly meetings with administrators about commencement, elections and the health of students. He added that he is working to develop a transparent report for student fees, which would detail how student fees are used.   	 External Vice President Johana Guerra Martinez said she has weekly calls with the University of California Student Association about COVID-19. She added that her office is working to support students through the pandemic in any way that they can.   	 General Representative 2 Orion Smedley said his office is working on an elevator simulation to improve productivity during move-in and move-out.   	 Academic Affairs Commissioner Naomi Riley said her office is creating infographics to inform students of policy changes regarding dropping impacted online classes. She added that her office is continuing its work with Books for Bruins.   	 Campus Events Commissioner Tara Steinmetz said her office will host weekly yoga classes via Zoom.   	 Student Wellness Commissioner Mihika Sridhar said her office will launch a COVID-19 relief grant and will release more information soon.    &nbsp;",['cap-samantha-fredberg'],"['news', 'student-government']",

[caption id=""attachment_379483"" align=""alignright"" width=""300""]  Council members were evaluated in these areas on a scale from one to five, with one being poor performance and five being excellent performance.[/caption]  The CSC is the largest student-led nonprofit service organization in the country, with over 4,000 students directly involved. Wisner had modest platforms when he ran for CSC last year but managed to accomplish them well and expand in some areas, despite some unexpected setbacks.  CSC hosts a Day of Service each year, where the group organizes and mobilizes an all-day volunteering event. This year, Wisner expanded the day to include a series of several panels to learn about service and its associated skills. This allowed those still interested in service but unable to participate in the daylong project the chance to get involved.  CSC also suffered a substantial loss this year, with four out of 12 vans in its fleet breaking down near the start of the school year. The vans are very significant for service organizations, which use them to transport volunteers to and from projects. This means these projects dont have to pay for transportation costs or find student drivers with viable transportation, removing a significant barrier for student service organizations.  Four vans down is a significant drawback, even more so as the vans were unable to be replaced at any point during the school year. However, Wisner has managed to replace and expand the fleet for next year, to up to 14, which the commission has been attempting to do for several years.  Beyond CSC, Wisner has also maintained adequate relationships with fellow councilmembers. Hes been generally respectful of everyone on board, recognizing that they are all students and all people.  Wisner has some regrets about this year. He has some platforms for next year that he wished that he had been able to get started on sooner. He wants to provide insurance for student service members in the case of accidents and wants to continue improving CSCs transportation service.

At the time, I expected to see my friends and floormates within a few short weeks. But I was wrong, and I never had the opportunity to bid them a proper goodbye. Instead of sharing this first spring quarter with friends, basking under the warm California sun, I found myself enrolling for online classes and packing up my dorm room.  Given the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, I know that self-isolating is the best course of action. Nonetheless, the abrupt change from a busy life in Westwood to Zoom discussions at home means that many of us Bruins are now facing the same conundrum: how to stay in touch with our peers during the quarantine.  Upon leaving Westwood, my friends and I promised one another that wed stay connected. From social networking platforms to video chat services, there are a   world of apps to help us do so.  Yet, consumed with life at home, our transition to online classes and the stress of the current pandemic, many of our promises to keep in touch have fallen through. Even though I often find myself bored or lonely throughout these unproductive days, I still wonder why I havent reached out to those who mean most to me.  Josh Cohn, a first-year business economics student, said that between managing school work and helping out at home, it can be difficult to maintain friendships.  It's an unfamiliar circumstance for everyone, so people are needing to spend more time looking after themselves, Cohn said.  One of the ways that Cohn has stayed connected with friends is through social media. Common online platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat have allowed users to keep in touch with one another and connect over the shared struggles of social distancing. For example, one popular Facebook group called  Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens  boasts over 525,000 users.   [Related:  Students, professors adjust to different time zones with online instruction ]   Now that life has shifted to the safer at home model, virtual hangouts have become the social distancing activity of choice for many.  Cohn mentioned that many of his friends use the app Houseparty to keep in touch. Houseparty is a popular social networking app that allows for up to eight users to video chat with one another. Mirroring reality, users can then crash parties of mutual friends and join their calls.  Those in quarantine seem to recognize the merits of apps like Houseparty, too. The popular app is now ranked number one in the Apple app store in 17 countries, including the United States.  First-year human biology and society major Pritesh Patel said that social networking apps have helped him stay motivated with academics while at home.  ""My coping mechanism back in school was to hang out with friends,"" Patel said. ""I relied on social interactions as a reward system for the amount of work I was doing.""  Patel also mentioned that he uses GroupMe, a mobile messaging app, to remain involved with extracurriculars and Greek Life. Despite these efforts, it can still be difficult to feel present from behind a computer screen.  Back on campus we would be forced to run into one another, Patel said. At home, were doing work and feeling isolated.  Similar obstacles have driven second-year American literature student Jessie Elovitz to get creative in staying social.  Elovitz said that she has used online games, such as Club Penguin and Game Pigeon, to have fun with friends. She added that she is working with her roommate to plan a virtual game night for their friend group.  However, Elovitz said that it takes effort to remain connected.  Its relatively easy to put down your phone and ignore the messages, Elovitz said. We dont have to be accountable anymore. Theres definitely less of a social mandate to participate.  Staying in touch with friends and campus life may require a touch of creativity but also heaps of proactivity.    As easy as it is to download an app or call a friend, taking that first step remains difficult for many.  Leaving spring quarter behind at UCLA has been tough. I meant it when I promised my friends I would stay in touch, but figuring out how to stay connected online is quite a learning curve.  While Zoom will just have to do for now, Cohn said that our return to campus in the future will be one to celebrate.  I anticipate next year to be even better than what we thought it could be,"" Cohn said.

550,/2020/06/10/the-quad-how-the-pandemic-has-uniquely-impacted-bruins-in-different-grade-levels/,135.0,131.0,264,95.0,0.9158,0.7481,$0.00,The Quad: How the pandemic has uniquely impacted Bruins in different grade levels,https://dailybruin.com/2020/06/10/the-quad-how-the-pandemic-has-uniquely-impacted-bruins-in-different-grade-levels/,"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 01:31:04 +0000",Camayak_4da5f3aa5f," Incoming first-year Eva Danesh has dreamt about attending UCLA her whole life. But, it's hard to imagine that ""Zoom University"" was exactly what she had in mind.    When Danesh was accepted into UCLA as a psychobiology student in March, she couldn&#8217;t help but picture her first day as a Bruin.   &#8220;I imagined walking outside, looking at the beautiful campus, meeting new people and being able to participate in activities,&#8221; Danesh said.   However, as the pandemic continues on and the future of in-person instruction remains tentative, the life Danesh pictured for herself on campus has slowly faded away.      Admittedly, Danesh and her class of fellow incoming first-years are not alone in feeling the effects of the pandemic on their UCLA experience, rather, the coronavirus has left its mark on all students &#8211; regardless of graduation year. But, though campus closures and online learning do affect all students, it is interesting to examine how students from different class levels have experienced and processed these same changes a little differently.     To begin, these differences in experience can first be seen through the eyes of a class we might accidentally overlook: the new Bruin class of 2024. For a typical incoming first-year like Danesh, concerns about entering college are manifold, and can include navigating large class sizes, living with roommates and moving far from home. However, though these concerns have been ably managed by many previous classes of Bruins, having to navigate the first-year experience during a pandemic is rather unchartered territory.   &#8220;When acceptances were released, we were still in the beginning phases of quarantine,&#8221; Danesh said. &#8220;I had no reason to think that school wouldn&#8217;t start for me in the fall.&#8221;   As time passes, however, the reality of having a traditional fall quarter seems further and further out of reach. When picturing her first day of university now, Danesh has a very different vision.  &#8220;I see myself as a very nervous girl in my bedroom, not really having a huge transition from my high school classes online to my college classes online,&#8221; Danesh said.   Like Danesh pointed out, the remote format of teaching can further exacerbate the worries that incoming freshmen already have about transitioning to college coursework. Being unable to interact with professors, teaching assistants and peers in person only amplifies these feelings of insecurity and uncertainty.  Nonetheless, while the incoming class of first-years may be grieving over what could have been a great first quarter, the current first-year class is reminiscing over their short-lived experience on campus.  First-year pre-psychology student Caleb Kalu said that though he got to experience two quarters at UCLA, he was especially disappointed to miss the last one.   &#8220;Everyone keeps on telling me that spring quarter is amazing at UCLA,&#8221; Kalu said. &#8220;Not being able to experience that is hard.&#8221;   It's true: Many say that freshman year at UCLA is supposed to be filled with exciting new experiences on a campus with a nearly perfect climate, felt most distinctly in spring. But, because of this year's circumstances leading to a shortened introduction, many first-years feel cheated out of the beginning they thought they were supposed to have.  For example, Kalu said that in addition to missing out on a sunny spring campus, he has also been denied his first season on the club rowing team.  &#8220;Our entire season was supposed to be this quarter,&#8221; Kalu said. &#8220;We missed five major tournaments and duals along the way.&#8221;   Even so,   in spite of these missed experiences, Kalu said he was thankful for the time he spent on campus. Like most of us, however,  Kalu remains skeptical that we will get the fall quarter in 2020 that we had hoped for.   &#8220;With the way things are shaping out, fall is not going to be the quarter I was expecting,&#8221; Kalu said. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to having some sense of normalcy, especially after this long period of being inside for most of the day and working.&#8221;   As reflected by the sentiments of students like Kalu, seeking a sense of control and normalcy during the age of quarantine is proving to be a common struggle for many of us Bruins. Yet, we all have our different ways of coping.  For second-year business economics student Binat Gousinov, knowing that she still has plans for fall helps her stay optimistic.   &#8220;I&#8217;ve been pulling myself through this by thinking positively &#8211; thinking of the fall and moving into my own apartment &#8211; I&#8217;m really holding onto that as motivation,&#8221; Gousinov said.   But, despite her positive outlook, the second-year acknowledged that it can still be hard to reflect on the people we left behind on campus.  &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to reach out to my graduating senior friends,&#8221; Gousinov said. &#8220;I completely don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;m going to see them again.&#8221;   For many of us, not being with the people at UCLA makes at-home learning extremely difficult. Not only are we losing the experience of learning on campus, but we are also missing out on the chance to maintain close relationships with the friends we have made along the way.  However, these setbacks aside, Gousinov said she is still looking forward to finishing finals. For Bruins like Gousinov, the end of finals week is a familiar light at the end of the tunnel from years long before the onset of the pandemic and remote learning.  &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll all let out a breath of relief when we start summer,&#8221; Gousinov said.   Though summer promises the long-awaited release from remote learning for many students, for graduating seniors, the new season marks the end of their time as Bruins.  Fourth-year human biology and society student Jessica Rauch said she hoped spring quarter would help her prepare for life after college. Unfortunately, though Rauch looked forward to spending her final quarter at UCLA with friends, her highly-anticipated farewell to college did not go as planned.      ""I wanted to let loose and have fun with my friends,"" Rauch said.   &#8220;I wanted to take this quarter to reminisce and celebrate.""   But, instead of a memorable quarter of fun, Rauch's time at home has left her feeling sentimental about her premature departure from campus.  &#8220;I was imagining myself smiling for pictures in front of Royce Hall, taking my parents to Powell Library and taking graduation pictures with my friends,&#8221; Rauch said.   Regrettably, the loss of familiar pre-graduation rituals is not the only thing soon-to-be graduates have to grapple with. Along with learning how to accept an abrupt end to college, Rauch said she and her peers   are feeling overwhelmed with having to navigate the unique financial burdens stemming from the spread of COVID-19.  &#8220;Right now the job application process is really tough,&#8221; Rauch said. &#8220;I think most people in my graduating class are dealing with a lot of anxiety and depression over difficulties with finances.&#8221;   If things were not difficult enough already, adding an uncertain job market to the mix definitely did not help. Nonetheless, even though Rauch and her classmates face this added challenge, Rauch has taken the time at home to seek silver linings.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve definitely been trying to think positively about the future,&#8221; Rauch said. &#8220;I think (in the future) I&#8217;ll recognize that I was privileged to have healthy family members, a roof over my head and food on the plate in front of me.&#8221;   Moreover, as Rauch applied the same process of seeking a silver lining to her reflections on   her   university life, she said her experience as a Bruin has given her positive insight on the world around her.  ""From an upperclassman's perspective: Take advantage of the moment, go do things and be spontaneous, care about your relationships and make memories,"" Rauch said. ""This has taught me that life is fleeting, you never know what's coming next. It's important to stay positive, take advantage of what you have and go with the flow.""   We can see from these various stories that the student experience is not always uniform, even when the student body faces the same broad changes. Though we may each experience our own unique woes, we can find some semblance of peace and acceptance in knowing that every perspective is valid and helps to create a  more interesting narrative.  So, to the nervous incoming first-year, the soon-to-be graduate and everyone in between: The future may be uncertain, and the way we experience things may differ, but one thing is for sure and remains the same &#8211; we will always be bound as Bruins.

Days blend into the next. Friendships have become nothing more than images and text messages.   Life has changed in a way unlike ever before.  It&#8217;s no surprise that mental health is a topic of increased focus with the rise of COVID-19. Anxiety, distress and feelings of uncertainty  have all been exacerbated by the pandemic and ongoing isolation.    Protests  against stay-at-home orders  are becoming increasingly common as well, with groups taking to the streets in large numbers. And with speculative reports that  lifting quarantine soon may be a mistake  and the theory that COVID-19 could become a part of life, the laundry list of upsetting news shows no signs of stopping.   The next crisis people are coming to face is safeguarding their mental health. However, the recent virtualization of society can also offer a resource for people in these trying times in the form of telehealth services.  The implementation of telehealth services for patients seeking mental health resources has become a growing focus for clinics and psychological services, especially in times of social distancing   when providers are unable to meet their patients in person. At UCLA, the Counseling and Psychological Services center has transitioned to Zoom calls for students seeking therapy and counseling services.  CAPS has also suspended session limits, extending its telehealth services for students up until the start of the next academic year.  In the time of widespread quarantine and social unrest, telehealth is a necessary benefit and resource for people. And for CAPS specifically, the implementation of telehealth services could be more than just a temporary fix during this pandemic &#8211; it could also help it address its capacity issues well into the future. In order to continue to help treat mental illnesses and promote mental health, UCLA&#8217;s telehealth services must be provided throughout quarantine and well into the readjustment period as lifting stay-at-home orders comes into consideration. Otherwise, COVID-19 won&#8217;t be the only concern people will have to worry about.  Life has changed radically since the onset of stay-at-home orders, and it&#8217;s undeniable that issues stemming from the pandemic will have a long-term effect down the road.  Sneha Thirkannad, a third-year biology student at UCLA and the   director of the housing reform platform at the Undergraduate Students Association Council Office of the President, said that the changes brought by the pandemic and the shift to online have been difficult in multiple ways.  &#8220;So not only am I disconnected from UCLA, but since my schedule is almost the exact opposite of my parents' work schedules, I'm disconnected from my family too,&#8221; Thirkannad said.  It&#8217;s clear that along with the physical threat of the virus, the change of daily routine is also a source of disruption for many people &#8211; especially students and workers. And the impact of this continued isolation will continue to have an effect, especially on mental health.  Robert Bilder, a professor-in-residence of clinical psychology at UCLA,   said that patients diagnosed with mental illnesses constitute an at-risk group.  &#8220;People suffering from mental health issues will only have their problems exacerbated by the ongoing stresses of the pandemic,"" Bilder said. ""PTSD and the fear of death are examples of symptoms and conditions that can get worse.""  Steps must be taken to protect and serve at-risk patients   during the pandemic &#8211; including the potentially increased population of those with existing mental illnesses and those with an onset of new symptoms   as a result of the change in lifestyle. And for college students the problem could be especially severe, considering that severe depression and anxiety have  risen sharply  over the past decade.   More so than before, it&#8217;s clear that telehealth services will need to account for this growing demand in health care. At-risk groups cannot be left under-resourced months down the line, as people are readjusting and unpacking the changes in their routines, when life is expected to return to a sense of normality.  For UCLA students, CAPS currently   provides psychotherapy, psychiatry, group therapy and clinical coordination services for students, through remote platforms such as Zoom, and are available five days a week as a standard of care for students during the pandemic.  Nicole Green, the executive director of CAPS, said that the transition to online services has been effective and met with a positive reception.  &#8220;Students that were already receiving treatment prior to the pandemic are able to continue getting help and with more frequent treatment,"" Green said. ""And our crisis line is always available for students.""  There are also legitimate concerns about the effectiveness and security of telehealth resources, especially with doctor-patient confidentiality. However,  growing research shows  that telehealth opportunities have been therapeutic for patients and an attempt at care and attention must be made. As such, the resources that are going into expanding telehealth opportunities must also include the security measures necessary.  Telehealth programs such as those offered by CAPS are examples of strong efforts that must be taken seriously by schools, clinics and governments across the world in order to deal with the inevitable fallout of the stress and anxiety caused by this pandemic. And as time goes on, these services should become a part of the standard for treating mental illness.  The pandemic has changed many aspects of life into a landscape of uncertainties and existential crises, but there is still hope to be found that life can get better and that there is support to be found.  It may just be in the form of another Zoom invite. ",[],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ns_.engineeringcaps.file_.jpg

Our country's long record of police brutality against Black Americans is evidence to their point.    Though it has been more than   50 years since the civil rights   movement of the 1950s and 1960s, we are confronted yet again with the racial injustice that has shaped our nation's history to the present. George Floyd&#8217;s death at the hands of now ex-police officer Derek Chauvin has sparked nationwide demonstrations reminiscent of past efforts to end police brutality against Black individuals in the United States.    Today, The Quad is looking into   the Daily Bruin&#8217;s contemporary coverage of some of these past demonstrations &#8211; specifically, the unrest following the verdict of the   Rodney King trial in 1992 and   the death of Michael Brown at the hands of white police officers in 2014 &#8211; in an attempt to examine   the different ways that individuals have   participated in the struggle for racial justice over the years and to compare them to the events unfolding in our country today.  Varied Nature of Protests  One similarity between these three sets of uprisings is the varied nature of the protests themselves. The current protests condemning police brutality against Black individuals have been both peaceful and violent in nature, much like the demonstrations in 1992 and 2014.  According to a 1992  article  written by then Daily Bruin staff member and alumna Christine Strobel, rioting and looting erupted in Westwood Village in the wake of the verdict that acquitted the four officers charged with using excessive violence against   King.   Looting and property destruction also occurred during the unrest following Brown's shooting, according to a  2015 LA Times article .   However, it must be noted that many peaceful protests are also currently taking place, just as they have in the past. A  June 5   LA Times article  stated that authorities believe that it is people not participating directly in the protests, but who are using the crowds as a cover, who are responsible for much of the theft and vandalism.      Nonviolent demonstrations also took place in 1992 and 2014. However, a 1992 Daily Bruin article said that the LAPD arrested even peaceful protesters, inciting frustration among community members toward police. Similar tensions arose between peaceful protesters and police in the wake of the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri.    Views on Violent Tactics   Though protesters today have condemned the LAPD for its failure to separate   peaceful from   violent forms of protest,   some individuals saw the dramatic social disruption caused by destruction in past protests   as the only way to bring about real change.  In an  article  written in 1992, then Daily Bruin staff   writer and UCLA alumna Heather Skinazi   reported on a talk given by   Cornel West, a Princeton University professor and director of Afro-American studies who was visiting UCLA as a speaker. He   said that the riots acted as a wake-up call to &#8220;spark positive change.""  Protesters in the wake of Brown's death in Ferguson were also divided on the kinds of tactics to use in order to advance their cause, with some encouraging the use of more aggression. A group of protesters in an  LA Times article  from 2014, for example, supported a fellow protester as he threw a bottle at police, saying that both violent and peaceful methods were necessary to advance the cause of social justice.  Others, concerned that looters and rioters would damage   the credibility of protesters and threaten the support of their audience, claimed to support the struggle for racial equality, but not violent tactics. Elan Lee, a woman protesting the nonindictment of the police officer who shot Brown, told the  LA Times in 2014  that she was worried such tactics would give a reason for media outlets to generalize the demonstrations as violent.   Community members also expressed various views on the tactic of aggression in these protests. Some used their negative judgment toward the violence to express racist sentiments.  For example, in 1992,   UCLA student Sanjay Sabarwal said in an  op-ed piece  that   some people who condemned the riots expressed anger that African Americans ""had the nerve"" to hurt white people, even though not all the rioters were African American. He said further that many people had expressed ""more emotion over that scene than over Rodney King.""    Government Response to Protests   Regardless of protesters' or other community members' beliefs on the merit of violence as a tactic, there is a common theme both today and in the past of some government officials failing to recognize and support positive activism.   For example, political science professor Victor Wolfenstein said in a 1992 Daily Bruin  article  that governmental authorities were quick to label even peaceful demonstrations as riots. Similarly, some police officers in the wake of the 2014 shooting in Ferguson   arrested protesters who weren&#8217;t violating the law,   thereby   adding to the image that any kind of protest, peaceful or violent,   would be met with penalizing force.  The LAPD has been under fire recently for arresting peaceful demonstrators and failing to differentiate between nonviolent activism and criminal activity.  ""We didn&#8217;t have protests last night, we had criminal acts,&#8221; LAPD Chief of Police Michel Moore said.  Moore went on to say that Floyd&#8217;s death was on the hands of those causing civil unrest, sparking even more criticism from protesters.  Not surprisingly, UCLA students have also had their fair share of run-ins with police during protests in the past. The LAPD arrested UCLA student protesters in 1992 and 2014, just as they have in the present.    Then Daily Bruin staff member Mimi Nguyen reported in another 1992  article  that at least four UCLA students had been arrested by the LAPD   when they failed to disperse from a peaceful protest, although the students claimed they hadn't been asked to leave. Then, in a 2015 Daily Bruin  article  that looked at the 2014 protests retrospectively, staff member Amanda Wilcox said that UCLA student Tala Deloria ""used her shoes as a pillow the night she was arrested"" for participating in a protest against police brutality.  In response to the current protests, the LAPD    used   UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium to hold arrested protesters , including UCLA students. Although UCLA was initially unaware that the LAPD would be processing arrests there, it did understand that the stadium would be used as a staging area and didn't take action to stop this arrangement, despite the current protests. On June 4, however, UCLA issued a statement condemning and prohibiting the LAPD's use of the stadium to process arrests   UCLA Student Involvement on Campus   Finally, as is demonstrated by the arrests of student protesters in all three of these instances, it is clear that UCLA students have been active in the fight for racial justice for a long time. One version of this activism can be seen through the work of UCLA   students from the past and present who have highlighted and condemned racial inequities and police discrimination on our own campus.  A Daily Bruin  editorial  from May 1992 reacting to the &#8220;not guilty&#8221; verdict of the King trial described one such instance of discrimination on campus when a university police officer violently confronted an African American UCLA student and yelled racial epithets at him for ignoring his request to step onto the sidewalk.  According to the article, such instances of police harassment on campus were routine.  The editorial then encouraged Bruins to take action against such institutionalized racism from within the university.     Bruins also embraced this spirit of action in the wake of the Ferguson shooting.  Following the nonindictment of the police officer who shot and killed Brown, hundreds of students gathered on campus in a protest organized by the Afrikan Student Union calling for the UCPD to require sensitivity training for all of its officers.  The protesters succeeded in pushing police and university officials to meet their demands, and subsequently, the Undergraduate Students Association Council formed a committee in collaboration with campus officials to address issues of racial profiling on campus.   Many UCLA students today are also taking action to   combat   racial inequities on campus and to look out for their fellow Bruins.  On June 4,   the Black Graduate Student Association of UCLA and ASU held a demonstration on campus to demand that the University of California modify final assessments and bring attention to incidents of racial profiling by the UCPD.  Furthermore, students led by USAC and USAC Office of the External Vice President asked that the state withdraw National Guard troops from Westwood because of concerns that their presence disturbs and creates fear in the community.     Thus, it is clear that examining the responses to these three historical examples of police brutality reveals similarities of the riots, protests and other actions that occurred in their wake &#8211; but why do these similarities matter?  On one hand, learning from the history of activism against police brutality may help us to better understand and process the situation our country is experiencing today. But also, police brutality isn't anything new, and though there may be similarities in the responses to injustice, it is the repetition of injustice itself &#8211; the senseless loss of life and recurrence of police abuse &#8211; that remains the most important commonality to remember.   UCLA students have been admirable in the social action they have taken, but the fact that our community is again upheaved by the death of Black individuals at the hands of police is a reminder that we still have a  long way to go to stop history from repeating itself once again.

With films, video games and even books being flooded with sequels, remakes and spinoffs, audiences in recent years have appeared to embrace familiarity over novelty. In Recent Rewinds, columnist Phillip Leung explores the entertainment industrys inclination toward reimagining and building on old stories.   Disney's new streaming strategy is apparently subtracting content from Disney+.  Disney has come under fire for removing supposedly mature content from its new streaming platform. Recently, the decisions to cancel the Lizzie McGuire revival and move the Love, Simon series to Hulu have been viewed as cases of overt censorship. However, such choices are more likely a calculated risk from Disney to distinguish Disney+ in a crowded streaming market as it tries to establish its platform as a family-friendly and nostalgia-driven vault of content.  The main appeal of Disney+ when it was first announced was having access to nearly all Disney content. Everything from Marvel to animated classics to ""Star Wars"" would be on a single platform. Unlike other streaming platforms, such as Netflix and Hulu, which benefit from a wide variety of content, Disney+s strategy highlights an abundance of one type of content  its own childhood classics.   [Related:    A quick guide to some of Disney+s original content   ]   The platforms approach to original content follows a similar vein. Some of Disney+'s originals include a Lady and the Tramp remake, The Mandalorian, a prequel to the live-action Beauty and the Beast and eight Marvel shows. Looking at the platform's content, it is clear Disney is betting more on nostalgia and entertainment rather than originality to sell its streaming platform. Netflix, on the other hand, is trying to establish itself as a platform for serious filmmaking, with Oscar-winning films such as Marriage Story and Roma.  Disney+s overall strategy sheds some light on why the Love, Simon'' television series, titled Love, Victor, was moved to Hulu instead. According to Disney, the series fit better in Hulus catalog for its inclusion of adult themes such as alcohol use and sexual exploration. Disney also owns most of Hulu, meaning the company benefits regardless of which service the show is on. In fact, the decision may help Disney profit even more, as it separates Disney+ and Hulu as platforms for different types of content, incentivizing customers to pay for both.  The type of content Disney+ is aiming for also explains the canceled revival of Lizzie McGuire. After two episodes were filmed, the  show was supposedly axed  for being too mature and not family-friendly. Given the shows close alignment with Disney, the revival wouldnt quite fit under Hulus content either. Disney may have also wanted to maintain the family-friendly appeal of Lizzie McGuire, meaning the companys only choice was to cancel the show.  While Disney+ may have a strategy of capitalizing on nostalgia-driven content, the Lizzie McGuire revival demonstrates the line that defines family-friendly content is arbitrary. A common example that many use to show hypocrisy from Disney+ is The Simpsons being on the platform. The show has attracted controversy for its mature content, with Hank Azaria recently stepping down from the role of Apu over concerns of whether the Indian character reinforces racist stereotypes. Despite being noticeably less family-friendly, the show is a staple on Disneys streaming platform.   [Related:    Recent Rewinds: Unclear whether Vines successor Byte will have a lifespan as short as its videos   ]   The show, however, is not completely free from Disneys meticulous efforts to maintain its image. An episode from 1991 containing several references to Michael Jackson is not available on Disney+. Additionally, old Disney films with explicitly racist content, such as Song of the South, have either had scenes removed or are entirely absent on the platform. Disney clearly is not afraid to remove any content that could taint its family-friendly image, but the grounds for doing so are inherently subjective.  Such is to be expected, as Disneys track record of respecting marginalized communities has been spotty at best. Many viewed the decision to move Love, Victor to Hulu as  catering to homophobic viewers ,   while media arguably containing more mature content including The Simpsons and Star Wars: Episode III  Revenge of the Sith resides on Disney+.  Disney also seemingly embraces diversity as a mere marketing ploy, with films such as Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward being publicized as containing LGBTQ+ representation  only to reveal such roles were given to insignificant side characters. As one of the worlds largest media conglomerates, Disney likely prioritizes profitability over sensitivity when categorizing its properties.  In the end, such small decisions likely play a minuscule role in Disneys profit margins. Disney has a stake in or entirely owns so many other companies that a decision to cancel a single show or move one to another platform  one that it also partially owns  is of little consequence. Shutting down Lizzie McGuire or moving Love, Victor, as upsetting as it will be to some audiences, ultimately will not be detrimental to Disney+ in the long run.  One can only hope Hillary Duff has a picture-perfect plan to keep the Lizzie McGuire revival alive.",['cap-phillip-leung'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/final.png

The layoffs came in early February, just months after TFT&#8217;s former dean Teri Schwartz stepped down Dec. 31. Her replacement, interim dean Brian Kite,  made the decision  in order to address a $2 million deficit in TFT&#8217;s budget. The move also eliminated some stipends and contract appointments, along with a reduction in spending budgets and an increase in staff responsibilities.  Students and faculty were never even made aware of the deficit in the first place.   Kite&#8217;s lack of communication surrounding the deficit speaks to a blatant disregard for employees and students alike. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is UCLA&#8217;s decision to proceed with the layoffs despite  pulling in  a $5.5 billion windfall during the Centennial Campaign. The university can&#8217;t control what areas Centennial donors contributed to, but it can control its publication of where those funds ended up, and, as of now, no one has that information &#8211; including those affected by TFT&#8217;s layoffs.  While TFT claims its actions had no impact on faculty and student services, students&#8217; educations have suffered and will continue to suffer as a result of these changes.  Graduate students &#8211; many of whom are already  striking  for a cost-of-living adjustment &#8211; say winter is TFT&#8217;s busiest quarter, as they run a large number of film productions. But with many departments now left shorthanded, graduate students are working more.  And that&#8217;s to say nothing of the effects on staff members who were laid off.  Liz Gerds, a former wardrobe stitcher, was let go Feb. 3, a week before her first full year as a full-time employee in the department. For TFT to claim these firings have no impact is naive at best and a blatant lie at worst.   There&#8217;s no denying that $2 million is a substantial deficit and that it could lead to some difficult financial decisions. But the $5.5 billion from the Centennial Campaign is also a substantial profit &#8211; and it&#8217;s the university&#8217;s responsibility to make sure the allocation of donations is accessible, public information. In a perfect world, improving transparency wouldn&#8217;t only come on the heels of massive deficits and layoffs.   But in this unideal situation, the university owes these employees that transparency, at the very least.  The Centennial Campaign donations aren&#8217;t a long-term solution to TFT&#8217;s budget problems; they might have served as short-term solutions while the university found a better way to fix the issue. If the TFT donations were there, it seems fair to think the university would have used them before firing long-term employees. But without any funding transparency to turn to, faculty and students alike have no way of understanding the situation fully.  Now, 11 people are out of their jobs, and everyone left behind is scrambling to cover them because the university opted for sudden change.  But at UCLA, that&#8217;s just called a director&#8217;s dozen. ",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/edi-art-1024x618.jpg

The Undergraduate Students Association Council 2020 election is underway. Voting began Monday and will end Friday. After UCLA  transitioned to online classes , the USA Elections Board had to amend many sections of the election code to accommodate for the new online election.  USA Elections Board Chair Navi Sidhu said that social media regulations had to be especially adjusted to allow candidates to use platforms outside of Instagram and Twitter.  &#8220;(We had to) change rules so that the elections wouldn&#8217;t be in direct violation of our guiding principles,&#8221; said Sidhu, a fourth-year psychobiology student. &#8220;We&#8217;re amending regulations as we need to be able to support candidates. ... Candidates have to really up their presence on social media and come up with creative ways to engage with voters on virtual platforms&#8221;  Sidhu added that one of the elections board&#8217;s main priorities in amending these regulations was to engage students and inform them of the running candidates.  The elections board moved up the start date for campaigning by two weeks, allowing candidates to run for a total of four weeks.   To help inform students of the candidates, the elections board decided to keep the scheduled candidate debate which was co-hosted by the Daily Bruin on April 30.   [Related link:    USAC candidates discuss referendums, use of student fees in online debate   ]   However, unlike previous elections, the elections board canceled the &#8220;Meet the Candidate&#8221; event, where students could meet candidates and ballot proposition representatives.  Sidhu said an online version of the event would not have been conducive to engagement because of the number of individual video discussion rooms required, and the board did not know how many people would be interested in attending. Instead, the elections board created more ways to present the candidates and raise student awareness about the candidates online, like creating interactive websites where candidates answer questions asked by students.  Despite these drastic changes, candidates remain optimistic. Many candidates have come up with new and creative ways to engage voters, such as creating short videos on TikTok or streaming on Instagram Live. At least two candidates had celebrities appear in videos about the election.  Some of the candidates expressed mixed feelings about these changes, especially about the strict guidelines for posting on social media. The guidelines state that candidates must end every social media post with &#8220;#MyVoiceMyVote #BruinVoices @uclausaeboard For more information on USAC Elections, visit uclaelectionsboard.org.""  Breeze Velazquez, a candidate for the Academic Affairs commissioner, said it&#8217;s very unclear to her what hashtags need to be included with every social media post.  &#8220;I&#8217;m so confused because I see people post &#8216;My voice, my vote&#8217;, &#8216;My vote, my voice&#8217;, &#8216;Your voice, your vote.&#8217; ... What is the hashtag?&#8221; said Velazquez, a second-year public affairs student. &#8220;I got sanctioned (when I reposted someone) because I guess someone reported the fact that I hadn&#8217;t written a hashtag.&#8221;  Velazquez also added that she thinks the two-week extension for campaigning was too much time.  &#8220;People are going to get annoyed seeing the same thing and people all the time,&#8221; Velazquez said. &#8220;And if you think about it, presenting everyone at the same time (in the &#8220;For the People&#8221; slate) is difficult to separate (us). I don&#8217;t want to post and spam people.&#8221;  However, Carl Illustrisimo, a candidate for external vice president, said that he thinks starting the campaign earlier was the correct choice.  Illustrisimo, a third-year sociology student, said the extended period helped candidates and voters transition to the new, online interface.  Similarly, Aidan Arasasingham, another candidate for external vice president, said that his team is using the extended campaign period to broaden the scope of what it means to campaign.  &#8220;Ideally all of us, whether they are candidates, or referenda, or student voters in general, should be focused on building voter turnout,&#8221; said Arasasingham, a third-year global studies student. &#8220;The additional time really allowed us to really focus on engaging new voters who haven&#8217;t voted before.&#8221;    Students are able to vote through the MyUCLA website until Friday.

But for graduate student protesters, that sentiment applies tenfold to them.  In the lead-up to the statewide COVID-19 shutdown, graduate student protests were gaining steam. Their cost-of-living demands crisscrossed the University of California and protests, including the possibility of a  wildcat strike , put the pressure on administrators to act.  Then COVID-19 hit.  Graduate student advocacy efforts are more low profile now, but make no mistake: while their demands are less visible, theyre not any less necessary.  This is no time for the UC to kick back and appreciate that no one is picketing outside its door. For administrators, it is comfort and privilege that allow expenses like rent and food to fade from mind  but not all graduate students can afford to have that luxury. The UC must actively engage with the demands of graduate students, as their cost-of-living needs transition from urgent to imminent under the strain of an economic lockdown.  The economic lockdown is looming over every member of the UCLA community, but for graduate students  many of whom were already experiencing financial instability before the pandemic  the coronavirus has jeopardized their living conditions even further.  And for the many graduate students working second jobs, social distancing has  severely limited  their ability to supplement unstable incomes.  UCLA and universities across the UC rely heavily on these students during the transition to online education. For all intents and purposes, they are the backbone of Zoom University  theyve helped establish the adjusted-for-online course structures, support students during discussion sections and office hours, and continue to operate the day to day of online schooling for many professors.  International graduate students may be even further disadvantaged regarding available finances. International students are already limited by the number of hours they can work per week because of visa regulations, and now are suffering without steady employment during this time of crisis.  To be fair, the UC isnt  doing too well financially . But if it had given graduate students a cost-of-living adjustment when they asked months ago, they wouldnt be in their current position. And if the UC is continuously demanding full tuition from all of its students, then it most certainly needs to keep an open dialogue with students who are in desperate need of financial answers.  UCLA and the UC cannot sweep the COLA movement under the rug just because theres a lot on their plate at the current moment. While there are plenty of hypotheticals to worry about, one thing the UC cant do is ignore its graduate students working around the clock to carry their online universities.

However, the organization has larger issues than its mispronunciation with so many film screenings and classes being canceled and moved to a virtual format at UCLA because of COVID-19. The&nbsp;graduate student organization Cineposium    focused on film and media programming  was no exception. While Cineposium was able to host screenings on campus before UCLA went remote, the organization was forced to transition into a podcast format. In the organization's new online format, co-host and graduate student Alexx Apicella said each week members watch a suggested film that's available on a streaming service, later discussing and analyzing it through the podcast.  We (transitioned) to the podcast because something we tried to do with our screenings was critically engage with the film and really get to talk about it,"" Apicella said. With asynchronous digital viewings there's no great way to do that, so our solution was the podcast.   [Related Links:    Transition to online class poses unique challenges for TFT students, instructors   ]   The podcast episode content is similar to the introductions at an in-person screening where they discuss what they did or didn't enjoy about the film said chair and graduate student Reed Williams. The organization explores what members find interesting about a film, which can spill over into Cineposium's   social media posts to further spark new conversations, he said.  Cineposium was originally created by   cinema and media studies students who wanted to practice presenting their work, Williams said. Many students in the program are seeking job opportunities outside academia while still searching for a space to practice critically engaging with films, Apicella said.  [caption id=""attachment_380078"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""741""]  Alexx Apicella, a graduate student and co-host, said the podcast is a chance to engage critically with films while exploring an opportunity outside of strictly academia. (Alex Driscoll/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  The initial structure of Cineposium allowed students to pull films from the UCLA archives in their original format and discuss the content in an academic manner with an audience. With this new format of watching a films online and listening to an analysis later via the podcast, guest speakers   are able to make their commentary as analytic or personal as they desire, said another   co-host and graduate   student Martin Ibarra-Ramos.  Its important for us to apply the academic element to (the analysis). This is something that (were) trying to design around our personal interests, Ibarra-Ramos said.  However, he said they had to contend with new challenges such as audio quality, accessibility and audience reach. Accessibility was a particular concern for Ibarra-Ramos because they had to ensure listeners could also watch the recommended content at home without barriers stemming from lack of finances or subscriptions.  [caption id=""attachment_380079"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Ibarra-Ramos said even after the pandemic ends, he hopes he and the organization's co-hosts will be able to continue the podcast and hopes it will act as a supplement to the films the organization screens in person. (Alex Driscoll/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  For Apicella, however, the main challenge with the transition online has been audience reach. Prior to the quarantine, their screenings consisted of a small, comfortable group of about 10-15 graduate students on campus. The team now must learn how to effectively utilize social media marketing on Instagram and Twitter to develop its online presence and expand its audience reach so that anyone  not just UCLA cinema and media studies graduate students    can access Cineposiums content, Apicella said.   [Related Links:    Theater students improvise virtual methods to replace in-person productions   ]   Were not just a podcast anymore, Apicella said.

Were hoping to be able to continue to expand.  While transitioning to a podcast and expanding audience reach has been an unexpected challenge, Ibarra-Ramos said he hopes to continue the podcast even when social distancing ends to   supplement their in-person screenings. This gives students the chance to mimic film festivals, so they can actively practice curating content alongside critical analysis, Williams said.

The third-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student will be one of the soloists performing in the annual event, which will be conducted virtually for the first time in its history. Anand said he is taking the new format in stride by being open-minded, exploring the creative freedom it provides to make a music video that captures his songs bittersweet message. He will be performing the first song he ever wrote, Years, which he said catalogues the emotional journey of his first breakup.  The lyrics were about accepting the fact that some things just aren't meant to be, Anand said. You went through what you went through, but there's so many good parts of it that you should focus on, and the bad parts will always be there. (The song) is just about moving past it and honestly learning from it.  Anand is no stranger to performing through a digital platform, having started his own quarantine livestream show called ""Concerts at the Kitchen Table."" He said he relies on music even more now as a form of escape and has been using his free time to develop his lyrical skills by writing from different perspectives. His most recently penned song, for example, is based within the viewpoint of someone who has been heavily affected by the quarantine and is not able to come to terms with it, he said.  He is also spending his free time creating a music video for Spring Sing, which Anand said is a completely new and unfamiliar process to him. Where live streams and performances allow for a degree of spontaneity, he said he has never lip-synced or done any performances that require a more planned out approach. Since he sings songs differently every time, it may be difficult to match up his lips to the prerecorded soundtrack, he said.  But aside from concerns about video editing, Anand said his main objective is for his video to reveal his emotional authenticity, hoping to emulate how the song would be performed to a small group of friends. He had the choice to embellish his music with additional instruments and backing tracks, but said keeping the performance acoustic was crucial to capturing the track's raw emotions. Even his wardrobe choice was methodically limited to a casual pair of joggers and hoodie, helping to convey a quality of realness to the performance.  Nothing will be a live performance because you're there in the moment and you can see the artist's reactions to the song, Anand said. But I want to do my best to make the video as realistic as possible and kind of just focus on my playing, try to get really into it to show it really means a lot to me.  This commitment to authenticity is what Nick Rodriguez, a second-year theater student, said makes Anands music resonate so deeply. He writes and sings from the heart, Rodriguez said, and the charisma and conviction he saw in Anand's livestream performances indicate that the song's genuine emotions will also not be lost in a video format.  He's not afraid to be himself in a business where a lot of people put on facades, Rodriguez said.  For filming, Anand said his choice for the videos backdrop further integrates the songs message with his aesthetic preferences. He filmed the video in Pacific Palisades overlooking greater Los Angeles, and he said the sunset helped provide natural mood lighting to match the song's melancholic tone. Anand said the scenery ties back to his memories from freshman year  having to mend his first heartbreak in an unfamiliar city alone.  Regarding Anands creative process, Emily Kohl, a third-year human biology and society student and one of the Spring Sing talent directors assigned to support Anand, said he always had a clear vision of how to pair his stripped down performance with a suitable video concept. The Spring Sing Executive Committee is also doing what they can to support the artists, such as connecting Anand to a professional audio producer in its alumni network to help polish and mix his prerecorded track.  It's hard with (the virtual) process to do something alone in terms of creating an entire video, Kohl said. If you're in a band or in a larger group, you have other people to support you.  However, Kohl said she was glad to see Anand eagerly take on the difficult process by changing up his content and finding creative workarounds to get his vision across. The prospects of navigating uncharted waters is quite exciting, Anand said, and he hopes the video will allow others to understand the story hes trying to tell and tie it back to their own lives.  I feel so honored to have the opportunity to play and share the song that I wrote freshman year, Anand said. Its kind of cool to be the first set of performers that are able to do a new iteration of Spring Sing.",['cap-alyson-kong'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Akshayanand-1.jpg

And the response has been clear:  Zoombombing  will not be tolerated.  Zoombombing is a type of cyberattack by which individuals hack into and interrupt Zoom calls, often using racist, crude or hateful imagery and speech. In the wake of an online-only world, these attacks have occurred at universities, elementary schools and in workplaces  at UCLA, multiple online classes have been hacked by individuals spewing racial slurs.  College students already face a turbulent transition to online education, and hateful acts like these only serve to make the web feel more unwelcoming.  At UCLA, student organizations like the Afrikan Student Union have stepped up and offered measures to condemn discriminatory speech and implement practical solutions. ASU addressed the problem Tuesday during an Undergraduate Students Association Council meeting and compiled a list of preventative tools available to teaching staff  including easy fixes like adding a meeting password  on a  recent Instagram post .  ASU also provided a clear statement calling on UCLA to respond to the issue  and administrators eventually did.  In the days since, university officials met the issue  head-on , working alongside law enforcement and providing support to those affected by such incidents.  Although it took some time, administrators had a commendable response to a situation on which they are no experts. In the coming months, there will be a lot the university doesnt know  and students can help to fill that knowledge gap. Following this situation and moving forward, the administration must engage with the work of student organizations such as ASU  not by simply taking their suggestions but by providing them a platform to reach a community that is already spread thin.  Chancellor Gene Block noted Wednesday in a campuswide email that many of the Zoombombing comments were ""anti-Black and anti-Semitic"" in nature. That makes consulting affected student groups all the more important. Those directly affected by hate often have the best grasp on the gravitas of the issues at hand, and the university should jump at the opportunity to take their guidance.  ASU has already gone above and beyond in approaching both USAC and the administration directly. But addressing these incidents is not ASUs responsibility  the real onus lies with UCLA.  The universitys  Incident of BIAS Reporting Form  is a good start in seeking student complaints, but these incidents demonstrate that theres a great distance still to go. UCLA could learn a lot from uplifting the work of students representing historically marginalized groups  and in the wake of Zoombombing incidents, that work could help bring the community together.  Punishing those who disrupt students access to equal learning opportunities with racist comments is important. But so is providing a comfortable environment that facilitates learning.  Students affected by Zoombombings may feel out of place or on edge during future classes, jeopardizing their education. Including the perspectives of student organizations in the ensuing conversation will put real weight behind claims that all students are welcome and valued.  UCLA should be pulling out all the stops to ensure its campus  whether virtual or physical  provides an inclusive education for everyone.  And whatever they do to achieve that should involve the students most affected.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/op.edi_.zoombombings-e1586302721945.jpg

Gavin Newsom&#8217;s initiative to shelter vulnerable, unhoused populations in hotels and motels.  Newsom collaborated with the state and county in early April to create Project Roomkey, which sought 15,000 hotel and motel rooms across the state of California to house individuals experiencing homelessness either above the age of 65 or medically at risk in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   As of May 29, Project Roomkey secured 3,510 rooms, out of which less than 3,000 are occupied, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. LA County continues to work with local hoteliers and real estate experts to identify more potential sites.  The NWWNC convened May 27 for a special board meeting to discuss the progress and future of Project Roomkey.   Councilmember Noreen Ahmed proposed to submit a Community Impact Statement to the LA City Council to expedite the room-securing process by coercing hoteliers to take in more people experiencing homelessness.  &#8220;(The council) was recognizing that there is more that the city could be doing towards talking with these businesses and trying to figure out more ways of creating solutions,&#8221; Ahmed said. &#8220;It just seems that (Project Roomkey) is moving a bit too slow.&#8221;  Ahmed&#8217;s CIS passed with a deciding vote and will be submitted to city council for further consideration.  Council president Michael Skiles proposed an amendment to Ahmed&#8217;s CIS, which would encourage city council to financially incentivize hoteliers rather than coerce them. The amendment failed at a margin of 6-5.  Skiles said past measures tried to address the homelessness crisis failed because of NIMBYism and the city should not place this financial burden unfairly on hotels.  Hoteliers may be reluctant to house people experiencing homelessness since they may violate franchise agreements and corporate contracts set in the past, said Kevin Crummy, a business stakeholder.   &#8220;You can&#8217;t have the government unilaterally come in and just rip up the agreement because two parties are depending on it,&#8221; Crummy said.  Homeless shelters around LA County experienced an increase in coronavirus cases, especially in Skid Row shelters, since early May. The Union Rescue Mission reported 99 positive cases and three deaths as of June 3, according to the LA County Department of Public Health.   The crowded environment of some of these shelters contributes to increasing rates of infection, Ahmed said.  The Westwood Recreation Center continues to shelter people experiencing homelessness. Councilmember Andrew Lewis said he would like to see local hotels participate in the initiative since most small businesses have taken huge financial hits as a result of the pandemic.  Ahmed and Skiles agreed that it is wrong to assume that housing people experiencing homelessness will harm a hotel&#8217;s reputation.  &#8220;If the issue is stigmatization of their hotel and this concern that people aren&#8217;t going to want to stay there, I think there&#8217;s a lot of other people who would see (sheltering the homeless) as a heroic step forward,&#8221; Ahmed added.  In Downtown LA, luxury hotel franchises JW Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton kept their doors closed as large homeless populations gathered in tight shelters by skid row.   Council members said some luxury hotels, such as the Ritz-Carlton and the InterContinental, received significant tax breaks and public funding in the past and thus should have a stake in this crisis.  &#8220;There needs to be greater dialogue that will make these (hotels) who have received public funds to see themselves as entities that are about the greater good, especially at a time like this,&#8221; Ahmed added.  Hotels and motels will receive 75% reimbursement for operational costs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a  statement  from the Office of Governor Gavin Newsom. The LA City Treasury will also benefit from added hotel revenue, according to Ahmed&#8217;s CIS.   The hotel industry in LA experienced an 80% fall in room occupancy and an 85% drop in revenue per available room as of May, according to a  hotel forecast study  by Phocuswright, a travel research company.   Lewis said the pandemic is crushing the hotel industry and the initiative should not make the process more difficult for hotels.  &#8220;This is a business issue but it&#8217;s also a humanitarian issue,&#8221; Lewis added. &#8220;If we need to financially incentivize them, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s an issue with that.&#8221;  Ahmed said she finds it important that the council addresses this initiative and has the necessary conversations on the homelessness crisis.  &#8220;There&#8217;s still some very real stigmas that exist around homelessness in the city,&#8221; Ahmed said. &#8220;Unless those get addressed properly, we&#8217;re going to keep seeing this kind of pushback.&#8221; ",['cap-arif-abd-aziz'],"['california', 'los-angeles', 'news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.news_.nwwncroomkey.DR_.jpg

The recent Black Lives Matter protests have brought about a necessary reckoning with institutional racism and policing in every corner of our culture. It&#8217;s time for Hollywood to consider the part they&#8217;ve played in valorizing the police through the decades.   The range of police shows, from the obviously problematic &#8220;Blue Bloods&#8221; to the more innocuous &#8220;Brooklyn Nine-Nine,&#8221; have warped public perception of justice in our society and insulated a harmful institution from scrutiny.   The relationship between the film industry and the police began in the 1920s when the industry quickly realized a partnership   with the latter could be  beneficial  for securing filming permits and ensuring leniency and discretion for law-breaking movie stars.  [caption caption=""&#39;Cops,&#39; a police reality show, has been on air since 1989, running for 33 seasons until it was recently canceled amidst the protests against police brutality. (Courtesy of ViacomCBS Domestic Media)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_386002"" width=""828""] [/caption]   Such friendly dynamics served as the backdrop for the creation of &#8220;Dragnet,&#8221; a 1950s procedural that began each episode with the words, &#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true.&#8221; Though &#8220;Dragnet&#8221; emphasized its supposed authenticity, each script had to be approved or altered for objectionable content   by the   LAPD's Public Information Division in exchange for story ideas and logistical resources.     The censorship resulted in a specific vision of law and order where police were community stabilizers &#8211; good people fighting criminals with measured and precise investigative tactics.   But the same year &#8220;Dragnet&#8221; debuted on television, the real LAPD beat seven civilians in custody in an event called  Bloody Christmas  which left seven men, at least five of whom were Latino, with broken bones and ruptured organs.   By projecting a positive image of police without the brutal realities and injustices, &#8220;Dragnet&#8221; effectively functioned as a public relations arm for the LAPD.  Though modern-day police procedurals aren&#8217;t as enmeshed with law enforcement, the majority of them still portray law enforcement in a largely uncritical manner. The best example of this is CBS&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Bloods,&#8221; a show about a multigenerational law enforcement dynasty that frequently depicts and justifies brutality. Protagonist detective Danny Reagan (Donnie Wahlberg) seems incapable of making it through an episode without roughing up a suspect, but is rarely questioned by his colleagues or superiors and   always rationalized by   a ticking clock.  &#8220;Blue Bloods&#8221; isn&#8217;t just at fault for   legitimizing extreme violence, but also for its biased and demeaning portrayal of Black activists and movements.   In one specific episode, a Black man is vilified when he throws himself out a window and falsely claims that Danny pushed him. In the aftermath, a prominent Black reverend leads a community campaign to get Danny fired and goes as far as encouraging a young witness to lie in his testimony.  Such convenient plot twists in ""Blue Bloods"" actively undermine the reality of the situation   &#8211; that   Black Americans are routinely subjected to police brutality and are oftentimes murdered because of it. It&#8217;s particularly galling and irresponsible to see a show actively take steps to discredit the very real systemic violence in the country.  And while &#8220;Blue Bloods&#8221; normalizes police brutality and suspicion of Black people, &#8220;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&#8221; renders them invisible through a veneer of diversity and cheerful optimism. The squad is a family of loveable, relatable dorks led by two Black men, but those features are what make the show sneakily problematic.  In the critically acclaimed episode &#8220;Moo Moo,&#8221; Sergeant Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews) is stopped in his own neighborhood by another police officer, leading to a conversation about racial profiling. While the episode is certainly thoughtful and moving, it presents racism as a bug in policing rather than a   feature.   The criminal justice and law enforcement systems are fundamentally broken, and no number of 'good' officers like Terry can mitigate that.   For their part, the cast of &#8220;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&#8221; did   collectively donate $100,000 to the National Bail Fund Network, but while the action is meaningful, it doesn't change the fact that optimistic feel-good TV utopias have dangerously skewed public perceptions of real-world police functionality and violence.   A  2015 study    found that people who watched crime dramas were more likely to believe that the police only used force when necessary and that police misconduct doesn't lead to false confessions.   On top of that, a  2020 study  looking specifically at police shows in the 2017-18 TV season found that many normalized and justified police misconduct, often depicting police officers of color performing such actions while also failing to accurately depict the impact of race on the system.   Together, the studies troublingly demonstrate how police TV shows simultaneously drive public perception   while overwhelmingly   portraying   a whitewashed, idealized version of reality.  There are no easy solutions, but with so much at stake, the responsible move would be to phase out police procedurals in media and find fresh ways to tell stories and uplift   new heroes. The process has already begun with the cancellations of controversial reality police shows &#8220;Cops&#8221; and &#8220;Live PD."" That kind of change will be slow to come, and in the interim, shows must do more to bring writers of color into writers rooms and approach law and order   stories with a critical eye. At the very least, they can no longer glorify cops who break the law in the name of justice.  With purposeful change, the film industry could and must become a crucial ally for activists and scholars by   helping audiences imagine what a world looks like without police. Rather than creating shows that actively feed into misleading narratives about law enforcement, the film industry could help illustrate the end goals of the movements   &#8211; seeking to defund or abolish the police &#8211;   by showing   teams of social workers   approaching   challenging situations with the training and restraint police officers lack.  Hollywood doesn&#8217;t hold the magical answer to solve the issues of police brutality and racial inequality in America. But media can be a crucial piece to undo the cultural entrenchment of law enforcement and help envision a more just future.

Council meetings take place every Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the Bruin Viewpoint Room and are open to all students. Watch a livestream of the meetings on the  USAC Live! channel  on YouTube.      Public comment    Delaney Ivey, a senior student supervisor at the now closed Kerckhoff Coffeehouse, said she was given paid administrative leave. However, after submitting a request for unemployment aid, she said she was given about $6 a day for the spring quarter. She added that she and her co-workers are confused about the policy, and asked the council to advocate for more funding for remote job opportunities. She also asked USAC to allocate money toward an emergency fund for students without jobs.  Numerous students gave their stances on the council&#8217;s recommendation for a universal pass- or no-record system to the Academic Senate. Those in favor of the universal grading system said since students impacted by the novel coronavirus might not have the same access to resources at home, a universal grading system would be the most equitable. Those who were against the universal grading system advocated for an opt-in pass- or no-pass system and said the lack of grades may affect students who would want to improve their GPA or want to go to graduate school.    Agenda    Election Board Chair Navi Sidhu said the election board calendar for the spring election will remain largely the same, but added that there will be modifications to the events to move them online. He also said in order to move marketing materials online, the board may ask the council for more funds.  Josh O&#8217;Connor, assistant director of leadership and involvement for Residential Life, said the university got hit hard by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and around 85% of Hill residents have moved. He said he expects more people to continue trickling out, and refunds, which many requested, will take a couple of weeks. Those who are off campus can request contract cancellations over the phone.  Dean of Students Maria Blandizzi said task forces to strategize how to best deploy resources are being created and are mobilizing.  Michael Deluca, assistant vice chancellor of campus life, said Student Organizations, Leadership &amp; Engagement is working to connect with registered campus organizations to communicate as the campus moves online. He added that administrators are still working on planning commencements. He also said UCLA is planning on using on-campus housing for students, including in a situation where a student may have to be isolated on campus. However, the university is offering space in the UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center and the UCLA Guest House in case the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center reaches capacity.  Abey Philip, Yale College council senator, said students at Yale University started a grassroots campaign for a universal pass- or no-record system, which resulted in an opt-in pass- or no-record system. University leaders are set to take a vote on the universal pass- or no-record system soon. Philip advocated for a universal pass- or no record system because not all students have access to the same resources at home, so it would equalize grading.

To start its MicroTransit Pilot project, the Metro Board awarded a $29 million contract to RideCo, a ride-sharing company that provides on-demand transit software and solutions, during a Board meeting Thursday.   Over 50% of trips in Los Angeles are short and driven solo. The MicroTransit Pilot project plans to offer an alternative for such trips by extending ride-hailing technology to regular and potential public transit customers.  Metro CEO Phillip Washington said in a press release that he expects the pilot project will help ease traffic congestion in LA County.   &#8220;This pilot project is the perfect way for us to test out a new, more flexible way for riders to make short trips to the store, to school, to the doctor or to connect with our bus and rail lines without adding to congestion on the roads,&#8221; Washington said.  The MicroTransit Pilot program service offers rides between 1 and 5 miles. Customers can order rides through a mobile app and pay with their credit, debit or TAP card. Metro&#8217;s MicroTransit Pilot&#8217;s fares will most likely be less expensive than ride-hailing companies, such as Lyft and Uber, but more expensive than regular bus fares.  RideCo conducted a case study with VIA Metropolitan Transit in San Antonio, Texas, in May where they replaced underperforming bus routes and complemented busy transit hubs with last-mile services.   RideCo reduced the waiting time for buses from an hour to 12 minutes and connected 40% more passengers to major transit hubs.  A Metro  press release  listed six designated zones where the MicroTransit Pilot project will operate &#8211; the first operational zone will be in effect this summer in the Watts/Willowbrook zone. The service will monitor demand and collect results during its successive operations between this summer and fall 2021 in the San Fernando Valley, Inglewood, Highland Park, Altadena and also around UCLA.  Before approving the MicroTransit Pilot project, the Metro Board offered a chance for public transit representatives and advocates to voice their opinions on the service.   Sebasti&#225;n Hern&#225;ndez, the senior planner for the city of Pasadena, said he felt frustrated that Metro staff did not incorporate input from several meetings with his office.  &#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed to see that the input we have provided is not reflected in what the board is voting on today,&#8221; Hern&#225;ndez said at the board meeting. &#8220;We asked them that Pasadena be considered as a true partner in this effort and that the process be transparent and that our input be thoroughly considered.&#8221;   Hern&#225;ndez did not disclose his office&#8217;s inputs during the board meeting, but Pasadena is one of MicroTransit Pilot&#8217;s six designated stops rolling out in summer 2021, along with Altadena.  Diana Chang, the Culver City transportation planning manager and a UCLA alumna, said she supported the MicroTransit Pilot and that Culver City would replicate a similar model.  &#8220;As part of the west side, Culver City is one of the most congested areas in the county,&#8221; Chang said at the board meeting. &#8220;Culver City has been exploring piloting a micro transit service as one of the strategies to enhance mobility service options and getting people out of their cars.&#8221;   Representatives from Altadena and the neighborhood of Westwood expressed support for Metro&#8217;s endeavor and applauded the promises of its last-mile services for schools, hospitals and senior citizens. However, some wanted the board to address the protests against MicroTransit Pilot&#8217;s implementation, such as Hern&#225;ndez's.  Eli Lipmen, president of EmpowerLA's Board of Neighborhood Commissioners, said he was going to use the service a lot with his family in Westwood. EmpowerLA serves to better connect LA&#8217;s 99 neighborhood councils' needs with the city government. Lipmen encouraged Metro to establish private contracts with larger institutions, such as Cedars-Sinai, Universal Studios and USC.  &#8220;There&#8217;s so many opportunities for an enterprise, for Metro, to actually make money off this program by contracting with big employers like USC, for instance,&#8221; Lipmen said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s move this forward.&#8221;  The MicroTransit Pilot service is the first project of the Twenty-Eight by &#8216;28 Initiative created by LA Mayor Eric Garcetti. The initiative hopes to finish 28 transportation projects in Los Angeles County before the 2028 Summer Olympics.

Velazquez wanted to advocate for more one-on-one support for students with disabilities from the Center of Accessible Education and worked closely with Facilities Commissioner Lily Shaw. They had meetings with CAE representatives to discuss needs for students, collaborated on campus events for students with disabilities, particularly film screenings tailored for them.  Shaw took the lead on these initiatives and eventually  secured funding  for renovations to the CAE space. While Velazquez didnt wish to take most of the credit away from Shaws work, the Board recognizes his offices work in facilitating those meetings and collaborating with Shaws office to secure funding and provide for students with disabilities.  Implementing different sensitivity trainings with Counseling and Psychological Services to better support marginalized communities was another platform on Velazquezs list, and he made progress throughout the year toward better serving them.  He collaborated with Student Wellness Commissioner Mihika Sridhars office to create a survey and feedback form for students and student organizations from marginalized communities to directly let CAPS know how their services are helping or not helping them. The data will be shared with CAPS counselors so they can tailor their services better for marginalized communities. His goal before his term ends is to get CAPS counselors to attend all of the sensitivity trainings for different groups like LGBTQ or undocumented students.  His office was relatively transparent and available to student organizations on campus, which helped his platform of increasing funding for cultural events on campus. There wasnt much pushback from administration to get these events funded, so all it took was his office directly asking for the funding, in which the editorial board commends Velazquez for taking initiative in helping serve students.  Velazquezs final platform involved waiving study list charges for low-income students to increase accessibility. While the COVID-19 pandemic derailed much of his offices work toward fulfilling this platform, Velazquez pointed out that the almost instantaneous manner in which the school waived study list fees for spring quarter indicates that it should be able to continue doing so in a more permanent sense.  Ultimately, Velazquez and his office made significant progress toward each of his platforms throughout the year, and the Board commends their work for fulfilling them while being an open resource to student organizations on campus.",['camayak_113'],"['editorials', 'opinion']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.Eduardo.LK_.jpg

Columnist Alissa Evans puts her cognitive science degree to use in Silver Screen Psychology, comparing movies and shows that boast accurate depictions of mental health to those that sacrifice authenticity for drama.    Real-life therapists have much more to say than &#8220;How do you feel about that?&#8221;   In fact, licensed therapists are  highly educated  professionals who often utilize a wide range of therapeutic approaches &#8211; including cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based interventions &#8211; to treat their clients. But popular films and television shows like &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook,&#8221; &#8220;50/50,&#8221; &#8220;You&#8221; and ""Big Little Lies"" overlook   such professionalism, instead portraying therapists as friends without boundaries or unhelpful, stoic listeners. Margaret Hunt, a clinical psychologist and faculty at the UCLA Psychology Clinic, said some of her clients are shocked when they actually acquire new life skills after a therapy session.  &#8220;The way (therapy) is portrayed in shows often makes it seem ... either cold and evaluative, like mind reading, or overly chummy and boundary-bending to the point of abuse,&#8221; Hunt said.  Cold and calculating portrayals are prominent in shows like &#8220;Big Little Lies,&#8221; where the therapist alienates a mother who's mourning the death of her abusive husband in season two. Shaming or criticizing people does not help change their behavior, Hunt said, and evidence suggests it can actually have the  opposite effect . In contrast, she said an ideal depiction of therapy would feature a caring client-therapist relationship that is guided by appropriate boundaries.  But even the friendlier fictional therapists often blur the line between professional and personal relationships with their clients. For instance, the therapist in &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook&#8221; goes to his client&#8217;s house and attends his dance recital. Although his actions may not seem problematic at the surface, such dual relationships can be  potentially harmful   , as alternate correspondences outside the office may result in exploitation or interpersonal conflicts.  Hunt said therapists can terminate sessions for something as minor as attending their client&#8217;s gym, so the overly intimate friendship in &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook&#8221; would likely be considered  unethical  by many mental health professionals.   [Related:    Silver Screen Psychology: Looking into often inaccurate film depictions of dissociative identity disorder ]     Duality is an even more serious violation when it involves a romantic or sexual client-therapist relationship, as seen in the series &#8220;You&#8221;   and the film   &#8220;50/50."" Hunt said therapists who engage in these types of relationships with their current clients will have their licenses revoked and can also be sentenced to jail in some states.  Although films rarely delve into these consequences, viewers who are familiar with therapy will likely understand that unethical therapists often serve as mere plot devices, said Donald Hiroto, a clinical psychologist and faculty at the UCLA Psychology Clinic.  But viewers less experienced with therapy may judge such depictions as representative of reality, thereby accepting unprofessional or ineffective therapists as the norm  , he said.    &#8220;Many people ... who have not been exposed to or have no sense of what constitutes therapy ... have the common view that therapy is just when you talk to someone, like talking to your neighbor,&#8221; Hiroto said. &#8220;They don't have the full appreciation for the power of psychotherapy.&#8221;  The efficacy of psychotherapy is apparent in films like &#8220;Good Will Hunting,"" which features Sean, a competent therapist who helps his client release childhood guilt using techniques like reparenting.   But even this well-regarded film is not a flawless portrayal of therapy. While conducting a session on a park bench is merely unconventional, putting the client in a chokehold is clearly unethical. Although he does cross some unambiguous boundaries, Sean's effective treatment methods and his dedication to the client make him one of the  better  cinematic therapists.   [Related:    &#8216;Killing Eve&#8217; season 3 recap &#8211; episode 7: &#8216;Beautiful Monster&#8217; ]     Unfortunately, less sympathetic film therapists who freely breach confidentiality still pervade popular media. In reality, Hiroto said most therapists work hard to protect a client's essential right to privacy. There are certain offenses &#8211; such as child and elder abuse or credible threats to harm oneself or others &#8211;   that require therapists to break confidentiality to report, Hunt said. But the therapist in the recent film ""Swallow"" breaches ethical conduct by accepting a bribe to divulge the client's personal trauma.  Despite such immoral portrayals, the  majority  of therapists will not commit any serious ethical violations throughout their careers. If a therapist&#8217;s vast array of strategies, exercises and coping mechanisms was more accurately represented on screen, Hunt said it&#8217;s likely more people would feel comfortable seeking help and consider going to therapy.  &#8220;People don't think of (therapy) as &#8216;I could go learn a huge skill set that would help me with all of my relationships and all of my communication and my self-esteem and my ability to tolerate distress,&#8217;&#8221; Hunt said.

I couldn&#8217;t go home for at least five more hours, and I was absolutely losing it when a friend from the office found me.   &#8220;Have you eaten today?&#8221;  &#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t eaten today, but I&#8217;m not hungry. I have to go study for the midterm I didn&#8217;t even know I have tomorrow, and I have to go double check the layout &#8211; &#8221; is what I started to say, but he cut me off by asking if burgers or burritos sounded better to me.  Ignoring my plaintive calls to let me get back to work, he drags me to the nearest eatery and affectionately calls me a moron while I cry into french fries.  This was the second week since I started shadowing the old managing editor to take over her position while still remaining in my previous job as a copy editor. It was thrilling but exhausting. Barring any late-night printer emergencies, which were frequent, I would be lucky to slink back to my dorm room by midnight. Bless my roommates for putting up with my 3 a.m. showers.  The self-righteous energy that I had while applying to be the managing editor dried up like ad revenue in a pandemic. I didn&#8217;t understand the weight or responsibility I would feel at the helm of an organization with so much history and tradition, not to mention that it is run nearly entirely by students who all have classes and jobs on top of the journalistic work they do for free.  With only a vague notion of what &#8220;running a newspaper&#8221; meant, I felt lost and stupid and useless. I felt like a fraud.  As the managing editor, I wanted to be a leader, an inspiration, someone who gave back to the organization that gave me so much &#8211; instead here I was, sobbing in a Veggie Grill, saved by the kindness of my co-workers.  (As it turns out, if you prioritize eating, sleeping and general wellness, you are better equipped to do the work of doing good and helping others.)  I learned the constant and suffocating pressure, and the fear of failing in myriad horrific ways, could be chipped away by tackling one task at a time. That one thing could be doing the job as written in its description: attending meetings, or cutting a story, or having a conversation with a particularly peeved source.  But oftentimes that one task was asking a fellow editor to grab coffee, making sure that we ate (and breathed) somewhere away from the damp, stuffy Kerckhoff basement. Talking to and getting to know editors and contributors was the best part of my job and gave me a reason to try and make the office better. In these conversations, the reason I was at The Bruin and why I felt so compelled to be a part of production every day came into focus.  These moments weren&#8217;t the most important to the organization nor journalistically valuable, but I think about them more than any others. The times when the digital managing editor, Michael, would turn a blind eye to my voracious french fry stealing, which eventually turned into wordlessly leaving fries on my desk after hard days. The weekly parade out to Rubio's for Taco Tuesday, even if we all collectively felt like trash afterward.  It&#8217;s a time-honored bonding tradition to rope someone else into going to Ackerman Union as you both procrastinate on whatever article you can&#8217;t bear to edit anymore, and that will iterate in its own way, COVID or no COVID.  I don&#8217;t want to say I transformed into a perfect manager during my tenure, or that my time at The Bruin was &#8220;bad but eventually fine&#8221; by any stretch of the imagination.  What I do want to say is the Daily Bruin is a community that supports each other and challenges each other to be better, by virtue of everyone showing up and working together to make something bigger than themselves &#8211; a daily paper, a newsroom, a friendship. This is something I believe is always true of this paper, no matter the circumstance or the leadership, whether I&#8217;m there or not.  When I felt buried in my own inadequacies, the smart and thoughtful people of the Daily Bruin helped me get over myself, take care of myself and helped me direct my energy where it needed to go.  It&#8217;s hard to fully express how deeply The Bruin challenged me and changed me and pushed me to act in ways I would have never imagined I had the courage to. You all have taught me to acknowledge when I wasn&#8217;t being my best while also treating me and my work with great respect. I&#8217;m grateful I got to work alongside such talented, dedicated, reflective people and break bread with them too.  I have made my fair share of mistakes and my fair share of questionable calls. To be perfectly frank, that sense of being an imposter never fully left me. I feel that I have left so much undone, even a year later. But I hold fast to the moments in between.  Leaving without seeing all my Daily Bruin folks in person is gutting. Right now, I can only look ahead to the time when I really do step into that accursed, time-bending, work-life boundary-blurring swamp of an office one last time.

Over on Hulu, Nick Offerman spouts platitudes about the deterministic state of universal physics in FXs new show, Devs.  And ""Dark,"" releasing its final season on Netflix later in the year, will join the slate of shows grappling with the role of the individual amid inescapable chaos.  When scrolling through streaming options, it can be hard to decide which shows to watch. Sitcoms and musicals provide escapism from the constant bad news, sure, but now is also the perfect time to confront thoughtful science fiction. Between ""Devs,"" ""Dark"" and ""Westworld,"" each reveals one common trend: the dilemma of fate versus free will. However fitting, the theme isn't a reaction to the COVID-19 crisis, as the shows were in development before 2020. But their coincidental releases create space to ask questions about the world at large, acting as a reminder of the power of choice amid a global pandemic.   [Related:    Second Take: Streaming services will saturate already substantial market, overwhelming subscribers   ]   Determinism is a complex philosophical idea that some take to mean that cause and effect are out of human hands  free will and an ordered universe are incompatible. Devs, Westworld and ""Dark"" are all  science fiction thought experiments  that ponder whether or not individuals actually have agency  a topic of eerie relevance in a time of safety regulations, protests against quarantine and looming uncertainty. Ultimately, a handful of characters within their respective narratives suggest determinism   is flawed  a message that, if understood correctly, may help protect our uncertain society in the long run.  Alex Garland  director of 2014's ""Ex Machina  created Devs, a moody miniseries in which a tech company called Amaya and its leader played by Offerman, Forest, construct an all-knowing quantum computer. Guilty and bereaved after his daughter's unexpected death, Forest seeks to prove that people's paths in life exist on ""tramlines"" and no one  because of the nature of cause and effect  can change their fate.  The premise of Devs is unsettlingly close to  actual quantum physics ,   and some might take this as a sign that destiny does, scientifically, exist. But Garland also introduces an Amaya employee, Lily (Sonoya Mizuno), as a counterexample. Her confrontations with Forest prove quantum data doesnt control her life: She refuses to be passive and, in the final episode, a simple gesture she makes of free will alters Forests tramlines forever.  Meanwhile, Jonathon Nolan and Lisa Joy present fate in Westworld through an action-based lens. Earlier seasons focused on androids called ""hosts"" in futuristic theme parks where humans exploit robots for pleasure, and the third season sees the androids break out into the real world. Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) is a host who developed consciousness, rejecting the programmed loop decided for her, and she learns that humans are equally relegated to inevitability.  In ""Westworld""'s dystopia, a supercomputer called Rehoboam charts out everyone's futures and neutralizes the problematic, nonconformist individuals. But, like Lily and her rejection of the quantum system, Dolores attempts to prove divergence is still possible, showing humans how to break their loops  violently if necessary.  Finally, the last iteration of ""Dark"" will further explore if cycles can be broken. Jonas Kahnwald, played by Louis Hofmann, began time traveling while exploring the mysterious caves of his town, Winden. With similar events occurring every 33 years, Dark proposes that destiny cannot be amended, and no matter how hard Jonas tries to change the future, his attempts only fit into the original timeline like an endless loop.  Clues for the upcoming season, however, suggest a solution in which an alternate world intersects with that of Jonas. The showrunners have spent two seasons building up a sad world of fatalism in which Jonas' own existence is inherently tragic, but this recent twist  like the themes of ""Westworld"" and ""Devs""  affords him the power to retake control over his own past, present and future.   [Related:    Silver Screen Psychology: While some films explore schizophrenia sensitively, others perpetuate stereotypes   ]   None of these shows are lighthearted viewing. Concepts of time travel, quantum determinism and surveillance technology are confusing, even depressing. The questions they raise are uncomfortable  yet theyve never been more important. Thinking about the dilemmas within ""Devs,"" ""Westworld"" and ""Dark"" holds a mirror up to our own reactions to life in a global crisis.  The characters of Jonas, Dolores and Lily represent the power of the individual to confront obstacles, and their fictional experiences reveal   the significance of free will, even when small decisions appear powerless against entropy. That said, the methodology of free will and action are equally relevant, and these three shows are more than just reflections. They are parables. The lessons depend on which characters you identify with, but consider this  those within ""Dark,"" ""Westworld"" and ""Devs"" whose decisions make a real difference aren't focused on self-preservation or egoism.  Free will is perhaps our greatest tool to protect the collective good, when we understand what it truly means. Rather than purporting free will for the sake of it, following health guidelines and social distancing represent individual choices that do, in fact, make a world of difference.  Lily attempts to foil Forest's God complex at the expense of her personal revenge over the loss of her boyfriend. Dolores expects to be destroyed for her cause  the liberation of all android-kind. Jonas is willing to stop the tragic cycle of time travel even if it means he will no longer exist. During the anxiety of COVID-19, the sacrificial nature of the characters in ""Devs,"" ""Westworld"" and ""Dark"" certainly provides food for thought.  So maybe God doesn't play dice with the universe. Or maybe he does.  But depending on which shows one consumes during quarantine, power is not completely out of our hands, no matter how overwhelming the circumstances seem.",['cap-nina-young'],"['arts-entertainment', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ae_.determinismTV.secondtake.courtesies.jpg

The UCLA alumnus and co-executive producer said the film's team wanted to emulate the atmospheres of ensemble movies like ""Valentine's Day,"" ""Love Actually"" and ""New Year's Eve."" However, rather than following a primarily white cast through romantic plots, he said   ""4/20"" leans into its comedy, and a multicultural cast aims to reflect modern-day marijuana culture. Masukawa said they filmed the entire movie in December in less than two weeks, and the scheduled release on April 20 was not affected by the coronavirus quarantine.      Masukawa said the film had a successful ""4/20"" premiere with Vimeo On Demand and is now being sought out for an online release by potential distributors.   [Related:    Budding Los Angeles: Intersection of cannabis and educational institutions may soon normalize usage   ]   The film takes place during the annual marijuana holiday in a dispensary and follows the lives of the married couple who own the store, their workers and their customers as they try to keep the store open. Masukawa said he hopes by intertwining the lives of characters from various socioeconomic backgrounds, a wider audience can relate to the film and understand why the holiday is so vital to the marijuana industry.      ""And ultimately, it's about togetherness and meaning and how humans can work together to achieve a lot more than doing things on our own,"" Masukawa said. ""So it's kind of the inspiration behind it, you know, kind of mashing these two different genres together in a unique and fun way.""  Much of the film follows Joy, the co-owner of the dispensary. She is portrayed by Nanrisa Lee, who said Joy is an outlandish and sassy character who becomes the voice of reason, strength and optimism in the film. Lee said Joy ultimately saves the dispensary from collapsing by bringing everyone together despite old rivalries, and the film advocates for unity during difficult times.   [Related:    Film student seeks to tell a human story of resilience in crowdsourced documentary   ]     For screenwriters Andy Bailey and Abraham Nseir, they said this is exactly the message they wanted to send. It was a coincidence that the film resonated during quarantine, Bailey said, as they originally only intended to write a comforting ensemble film.   Bailey said the comedy lent itself to a tone similar to that of ""Half Baked"" or ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" which Bailey sees as movies that are both comforting yet silly and goofy. He said he hopes ""4/20"" is able to entice moviegoers and cannabis fanatics alike as they balanced the jokes with a contemporary message about the reality of the marijuana industry.   Nseir said they hope the film can show a different side of weed culture than what is often portrayed in the media.  &#8220;We wanted to show a side marijuana culture that was more than just a couple of stoners running around,&#8221; Nseir said. &#8220;(The film) has a really diverse group of people and sort of represented what (marijuana culture) looks like today.&#8221;  Now hoping for the film to be picked up by a larger distributing network, Masukawa said he attributes much of the film's Vimeo success to the release during a time when physical premieres and movie theaters aren't an available option. While his team didn't account for the quarantine, he hopes ""4/20"" can provide memorable laughs for those at home who are scouring the internet and streaming services for fresh content.  &#8220;It's a very difficult time for many people,"" Masukawa said.

When the Getty fire threatened UCLA&#8217;s campus last fall,  some expressed concern  over the university's communication efforts. Students were notified about the fires via email but were not told to evacuate.  In contrast, UCLA&#8217;s COVID-19 pandemic response began in late January, with an email notifying students about precautions being taken regarding the coronavirus. The university proceeded to send periodic updates leading up to the  March 10    announcement that classes would be remote for the remainder of the school year.  The stark differences between UCLA&#8217;s response to the Getty fire and the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic underscore the need for a standardized safety procedure the university can follow in light of fast-paced changes to the status quo.   Unlike the Getty fire, students were constantly updated about safety precautions and changes to instruction, which made an overwhelmingly difficult situation a little easier to manage.  Even though the shift to online instruction was days before final exams, safety was put before grades, students' lives before educational continuity. The university's proactiveness and commitment to updating students in this most recent crisis should be used as an example for how to handle future disasters.     And since it's been done once before, it can be done again.      The Getty fire safety response lacked a concrete evacuation plan. Students were first notified about the fire via email in the early morning of October 28. Subsequent emails grew more alarming in tone, but the several thousands of students living on campus were not given definitive answers on whether they should stay on campus or evacuate.  &#8220;Probably the one critique I could have is they could have handled that last alarm better,&#8221; said Walker Subbotin, a third-year political science student. &#8220;Kids didn't know (whether or not) they're supposed to leave when the fire is on campus.&#8221;   Emails were about air quality and the proximity of the fire. There weren&#8217;t any direct orders to  shelter in place  nor were there instructions on how to find a safe location to remain during a disaster.   &#8220;There wasn't a clear solution for that and so that's why we have the shelter in place,&#8221; said   Orion Smedley, a third-year physics student and general representative 2 for the Undergraduate Students Association Council. &#8220;Except I think that worries a lot of students because shelter in place (only) hopefully works.&#8221;  Beyond that, the university failed to provide students with information about safety measures like possible evacuation routes.     &#8220;I don't really know the protocol (for fire safety), ""  Smedley said.  "" I know during the fires, definitely even the RAs didn't know (the) protocol.""  Beyond the immediate danger of the fire, other repercussions followed,   such as concerns about  interruptions of midterms for commuter students .  The university should&#8217;ve considered other options like pushing midterms back a week to give displaced students time to readjust, Subbotin said.   In contrast to the relative chaos of the Getty fire, the university's response to the   COVID-19 pandemic was a slow burn.   Between January and March, about a dozen emailed updates were sent to students, faculty and staff, some of them reaching up to 90,000 people involved with the campus community, Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck said.  These emails reflected the fast-moving pace of decisions and gave students information on the   necessary precautions students and faculty members should take.   They also contained plans for winter quarter finals and beyond.   &#8220;Between the Daily Bruin and the email messages that were going to every student, ... I think students were well-informed with regard to what the issues were, what the campus was doing, how it impacted their education,&#8221; Beck said.   Even though students were informed, they weren&#8217;t involved in the decision-making process. This is especially true of the members of USAC, who felt they were shut out of conversations about students' well-being.  &#8220;(The members of USAC) felt that the decisions were being made without us having advanced privy knowledge of them,&#8221; Smedley said.  USAC leaked screenshots about the campus closure hours before it was announced to the general student body. While this represented a lack of oversight on USAC&#8217;s behalf, the UCLA administration handled the decision well, given the unprecedented circumstances.   &#8220;I think that the entire (USAC) situation shows what happens when students are put in these leadership roles, and they don't handle it like administrators do,&#8221; Subbotin said.    Even though the university was far better in communicating safety precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic than  the Getty Fire, there is room for improvement. The administration must establish open lines of communication with students to enable them to better protect their physical safety and to  plan ahead    during a rapidly changing situation.   The  adjustment to final exams , which was announced on March 12, gave faculty increased options for final exams, such as making them optional, extending deadlines or offering alternate assignments.   This was a drastic measure taken to assuage students&#8217; fears about their grades as many were scrambling to leave campus. It showed a marked improvement over the Getty fire, when the university was  noticeably silent  on what changes students should     expect in their midterm examinations.      Students, at the very least, deserve information about their education.  Granted, natural disasters are unexpected and emergency plans must be adapted to fit the situation as it unfolds.   Additionally, each disaster is different. This,   however, does not negate the need for standardized safety measures aimed at keeping students safe. The university must develop a comprehensive emergency plan that     can apply to a variety of potential disasters so communication with students is clear.  The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that it pays to plan ahead. Other disasters will happen in the future. It may be years or months from now, but we need consistent methods for notifying students of protocols and decisions, as well as reasonable changes to instruction.  Because the last thing students should have to worry about is what to do during a fire.

Beth Smith is a forgettable name but an unforgettable character.  In the season four finale of Rick and Morty, the real Beth Smith returns donning battle gear and a ""Mad Max"" undercut. Having been sent to a ""Star Wars""-esque universe by her father Rick in the third season, Beth discovers   he buried an explosive chip in her neck to prevent her from disrupting his manufactured family dynamic. She soon finds Rick has   replaced her with a clone implanted with her memories and domestic existence.   As Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri progresses, neither Beth is entirely sure which one is real  but both eventually realize two Beths are better than one Rick.    The episode follows in the steps of Childrick of Mort, critiquing Beths unhealthy dependence upon Ricks approval through the resurrection of Birdperson and his undercover wife Tammy. Acting as a morbid homage to the lives he has destroyed, the finale allows Rick to win only superficially, leaving a trail of Gromflomites and smoking portal guns behind him. But in the end, he is left to fend for himself in a meaningless existence of his own creation  and deservedly so.  Opening with a picturesque family meal, the finale begins with clone Beth bullying her husband Jerry over his obsession with puppetry, while Morty and his sister Summer leave to pursue a frivolous invisibility belt subplot. Like the previous episodes, their side quest has little bearing on the plots development and only serves as Ricks personal deus ex machina.  Predictably, Summer uses the belt to infiltrate her crushs home until Morty steals it to spy on undressing cheerleaders. While a useful exploration of their moral regression as characters  their younger selves   wouldve at least batted an invisible eye  their perverse forays into puberty are both invasive and unoriginal.  Across town, clone Beth and Jerry attend family therapy with the quietly incisive Dr. Wong from season three's Pickle Rick, before being attacked by the real Beth.   At a glance, Dr. Wongs two minutes of therapy seem woefully inadequate. But, as Rick arrives and leaves the therapist behind to rescue his family, the sessions brevity becomes cleverly symbolic.    In season three, the family needs Dr. Wong to become aware of their own toxicity    now, because the Smiths have the ability to internalize her observations, Dr. Wong can   no longer be the singular, active force in their improvement.  Speeding away from the therapists office, the family runs into a galactic fleet led by Tammy, who is searching for the   real Beth. While Rick evades defeat with the help of the teenagers invisibility belt, the two Beths are captured    their father still refusing to reveal who the clone is.  In their cell, the two Beths confront themselves as real Beth accuses her clone of becoming a complacent dolt of domesticity, while clone Beth suggests the other uses her gun-happy adventures to emulate Rick. Their conversation demonstrates the Bechdel test in its full glory, providing a reminder of the shows governing law of science: growth is only possible in the absence of Rick.  Meanwhile, Rick battles his former best friend Birdperson, newly christened as Phoenixperson or Pee-Pee."" Decked out with laser wings and cyborg armor, Phoenixperson leaves Rick half-alive and bleeding out. A well-placed shot shows Phoenixpersons claw caging Ricks spilling organs, referencing the myth of Prometheus to foreshadow Ricks perpetual suffering. Luckily, the two Beths find a fatal flaw  an off switch  in Phoenixpersons impenetrable armor after Jerry distracts him with puppetry.  After saving Rick from Phoenixpersons talons, the two Beths demand to know who is the clone  only to find out he doesnt know. Although Rick has a device to show the truth, the Beths walk away. With both having developed separate mechanisms to seek his approval, even real Beth's staunch badassery is merely another version of subservience to Rick. The only recourse is to walk away entirely, to not know the truth, and divest Rick of the power to define their existences by placing them into categories of clone and nonclone.  Alone with himself, Rick uses the device to retrieve the forgotten past and watches himself switch around his daughters like a game of thimblerig. In his final line, Rick almost reaches clarity as he says to himself, Im a terrible father.   However, as he revisits the skeletal remnants of Phoenixperson hanging on his door, the line is not allowed to linger    and is     immediately undercut by, but at least Im a pretty good friend.  In a brilliant conclusion to the season, Rick is alone with himself in a metaphorical mirroring of Beth and her clone    but unlike his daughter, he's unable to walk away from his own self-destructive tendencies. When even self-awareness must be buttressed by irony,   Rick is destined to be alone, no matter how many clones he makes.",['cap-kaia-sherry'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.ae_.rickandmorty.5.courtesy.jpg

The alumnus and current director of the University of Michigan's Master of Fine Arts program received a Guggenheim Fellowship in the field of study of fine arts this year. As of right now, Khan is conceptualizing his newest project   by depicting ""One Thousand and One Nights"" &#8211; a collection of Middle Eastern folktales &#8211;   as well as other Middle Eastern and South Asian mythologies through emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and drones.  ""I realized that society was being affected by (new technologies),"" Khan said. ""I wanted to not just be the maker of this technology but also be critical of it ... to reflect back on society a little bit.""   Khan's projects have included a technological system that ranks   viewers of his exhibition based on the number of Google search hits their name incurs, and now he said he&#8217;s working to partially recreate tales of the past using   AI, drones and contemporary technologies. Media art is an evolving art form just like any other, but Khan said it is nebulous in forms of materiality. Although it is a vast form of artistic expression, Khan said its ability to allow audience participation is a distinctive aspect of media arts.  &#8220;With technology, a certain type of interactivity is allowed that I&#8217;d like to say a painting or sculpture didn&#8217;t allow,&#8221; Khan said. &#8220;You could say the audience completes the work in their interaction.""   [Related Links:    Student paints picture of how science background can strengthen art   ]   But definitions of the evolving art form are quite complicated, said Casey Reas, a professor of design media arts at UCLA. New media arts is an artistic practice that dates back to the 1920s, Khan said. The artistic expression itself in new media arts is much more amorphous and difficult to define than other art forms because of the ever-changing materiality of the technology, Reas added.  &#8220;In the same way that ideas in painting are continuously moving and changing, ideas in media are also changing,&#8221; Reas said. &#8220;But the medium itself, how software operates or works or what it&#8217;s capable of doing also changes. ... (It's) a little more difficult to pin down.&#8221;  Khan said he is concretizing his project by incorporating ancient stories through AI oral storytellers that embody Scheherazade &#8211; the narrator of ""One Thousand and One Nights"" &#8211; and a carpet   that flies with the assistance of drones. As the project is in development, Khan said he is still evolving the specifics of the art, but he hopes digital art can provide him a pre-colonial perspective of Middle Eastern and South Asian history.  Khan's interests are not exclusively technology-based, as he said he was attracted to older tales from the Middle East and South Asia because they capture the native people's pre-colonial imaginations. However, Khan said he is aware of the implications of using these technologies to depict these cultures and their histories.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve been exploring the flying carpet, but it&#8217;s now made with drone technology,&#8221; Khan said. &#8220;But what are drones for a lot of the  se communities in the Middle East and South Asia? It's exciting (technology), but it's also (important to recognize) that same technology&#8217;s role ... in the contemporary.&#8221;    [Related Links:    Student artist combines classical art approach with 3D rendering   ]   His interest in studying humans through a technological lens stems from his studies, Khan said. Victoria Vesna, one of Khan's previous design media arts professors at UCLA, said Khan recognized that definitions for media arts often   describe the relationship between humans, technology and the environment. Khan said he is now applying this ideology to his current project, which relies heavily on the overlap between the past and the present.  &#8220;I appreciated his ability to go back and forth between what&#8217;s right in front of (the artist) and what could be &#8211; with (or without) technology,&#8221; Vesna said. &#8220;He would just seamlessly go in and out of technological (and nontechnological) ideas.&#8221;  By using drones and AI to depict ""One Thousand and One Nights,"" Khan said he plans to memorialize the modern stories of immigrants with those of the past.   However, he said creating time-spanning stories with AI narrators can sometimes pose a challenge as AI must be guided on specific data points, but Khan said he has found similar themes in both ancient mythologies and modern immigrant stories to create a cohesive narrative.  Khan said that many myths are based on occurrences of the everyday and that some immigrant stories can be just as fantastical as the mythologies. Based on practicality and introspection, Khan said he is not placing a time restriction on his work as his plans for the project could change. Regardless, Khan remains committed to sharing both immigrant and pre-colonial stories from the Middle East and South Asia in the finished product.  &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to extract the fantastical and magical and find a way to reimagine (the stories), but not just have a pure technical illustration of what happened,&#8221; Khan said. &#8220;(I want to) ... understand (the stories) in a contemporary condition as well.&#8221; ",['cap-tara-oldenburg'],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/osman.jpg

The first-year ethnomusicology student will be competing in Spring Sing with her original song, Wonderland, which she will be singing with her ukulele. The song reflects on her journey to UCLA and is one of many in her original repertoire, she said. Her first songs date back to third grade and since then, Patel said her songwriting has matured. Rather than forcing out songs for the sake of it, Patel said she now writes from raw emotion as a form of catharsis.  Its gotten to the point where songwriting has become my therapy, Patel said. Its where I go whenever Im stressed or whenever I need to ease my mind off of something and escape. ... Every single day I fall in love with it more.  Patels love for songwriting goes hand in hand with her love for singing, she said. When the time came to choose between orchestra and choir in elementary school, she said she chose the latter and continued to develop as a vocalist, picking up the ukulele along the way. Over time, Patel said music became a vital form of self-expression and emotional relief. Brayden Sutton, a second-year biochemistry student and member of Patels a cappella group, Pitch, Please!, said her passion for music   is palpable through the way she physically emotes while performing.  She very much feels the music that she sings or performs, Sutton said. Even just in rehearsals when were going through music, her facial expressions ... show how much she connects to music.  Emotional connection is at the very core of Patels songs, which she said are usually produced by a rush of feelings late at night. The overwhelming stress and angst of the college applications season led her to write Wonderland, which chronicles the obstacles that stood in her path on the road to her dream college, or UCLA  her wonderland. During the journey, Patel said she reminisced on the past when such struggles, like juggling college applications with an already long list of responsibilities, were not even within eyesight.  Opening wistfully with Ive been trying too hard for this wonderland of gold, Patel said the lyrics are meant to have a tint of irony, since she recognizes that dreams are brought to life with hard work. Such juxtaposition of idealism and reality exists in the musical composition as well. She said her use of a fast-paced rhythm and minor chords  which are usually more somber  are an unexpected combination.  I use a lot of minor chords in the song but I try to keep it upbeat, so you can be jamming along, Patel said. Secretly, theres a little bit more weight to the meaning behind the song. (But) if youre not listening to the lyrics, youre just vibing.  The addition of her occasionally raspy voice  which Patel said is dark with deeper tone  further contributes to the duality in her song. Wonderland is a cheery outlier among her usual compositions, since Patel said she gravitates toward writing more melancholic and slow-paced songs. Yet, the songs light airiness contrasted with yearning lyrics mirrors the complexity of her own emotions during strenuous times, she said.  Not only does the song manage to capture Patels feelings, but it also encapsulates her as a person, said her friend Abbey Dunlap. To the inexperienced listener the deeper undertones of pining and strife of the single may go unnoticed. However, the layers to the song are analogous to the dynamic between Patels bubbly optimism and more sensitive side, Dunlap said.  When you first meet her  to the majority of people  shes just someone who (makes you think) 'How could she ever be sad or upset or angry? Dunlap said. But then when you really get to know her, ... you see shes more than this shining, happy person all the time.  Now that Patel has finally reached her wonderland of gold, she said she is eager to shed her exterior and expose all the intricacies of her personality by performing her   song at Spring Sing. Although being subject to the judgment of thousands of strangers is intimidating, she said having the strength to lower her guard and share music from deep within gives her a surreal feeling like no other.  What I love so much about (performing), and especially what Im excited to do for Spring Sing, is just being vulnerable, Patel said. You just go out there and put all your emotions out to people who dont know your story.

He warned us not to take that route, however, because college provides us with so many experiences that we would not want to miss.   I did not understand what he meant then. In fact, it took me a while to discover what UCLA had in store for me. Trial and error defined my first year of college. I questioned my major multiple times, tried to join clubs that ultimately did not suit me and struggled to find my true home on campus.  Finally, during sophomore year, everything came together. I took chances and explored opportunities I had not previously considered. I took a leap of faith and joined a student theater company, in which I met the friends who I now consider family. That year, I decided to live my life to the fullest with no regrets.  I also began reporting for the Daily Bruin and discovered my love for writing about science and medicine. I bonded with many talented writers in the newsroom. The Daily Bruin taught me the importance of writing with accuracy and honesty. The memories I made as a News writer will continue to influence my work far outside the walls of Kerckhoff Hall. I still remember the pride I felt when I saw my first article in print. Writing about scientific advancements on campus gave me the opportunity to share research and projects that will one day change the world. I saved copies of every article I ever wrote, and I will cherish them for the rest of my life.  I chose to give UCLA my all, even when I felt stuck, and I feel so thankful I made that decision. The classes I took will allow me to change the world after graduation. The mundane experiences, like picnics near Janss Steps and eating gelato at Caf&#233; 1919, hold as much value as the amazing opportunities UCLA has provided me. I participated in the stage adaptation of one of my favorite films, ""The Little Mermaid,"" and even studied for a quarter in our nation&#8217;s capital.  Sometimes, I think back to who I was as a freshman in high school, listening to my English teacher praise the glories of college. And I remember how proud I felt when I walked onto UCLA&#8217;s campus as a student for the first time. I wish I could have prepared myself for the lowest moments, but I also know that without them, I may not appreciate how amazing my life has become. Four years truly pass in the blink of an eye. When a global pandemic cut my senior year short, I realized I had participated in many traditions for the last time. And I feel so grateful I learned to value them when I had the chance.  Since my freshman year, I have also realized that there will be more uphill battles to come. Life will never give me everything I want, and I will continue to stumble and make mistakes. All aspects of life take practice. The most we can do is try to be better than the person we were the day before.  My chapter at UCLA has come to an end. My story was a tumultuous one, and thankfully, it has the best ending I could have possibly written. Even though I lack a cap and gown and a traditional graduation ceremony, I am surrounded by my friends, my family and four years&#8217; worth of memories. The next chapter of my life is waiting to be written, and I already have a pen in hand. So, moving forward, I will continue to cherish every moment because I know the best is yet to come.

After every buzzing tone, we anxiously grabbed our devices, checked our emails and received not only a new campus update, but also the basis for a whirlwind of emotions.  However, behind the scenes of the frenzy that ensued post-email release were officials trying to figure out what to say and how to say it; which, in this case, concerns news of a pandemic.  In light of this, the Quad is here to explore how our university has navigated this task, while also analyzing the differences in various forms of mass communication  specifically, how the source of the news informs its message.  To begin,   one of the first email notifications to the UCLA community marked with the word coronavirus came March 2 from Block. In this early update, Blocks words evoked a sense of calm and matched the sentiment of an  article from the Los Angeles     Times , also posted March 2. At this point, the virus hadnt fully come into force  as both the LA   Times and Block wrote, the risk to the general public was low.  However, as the situation progressed, even if it was only a matter of days, the similarities between the communication from the UCLA administration and other news sources began to unravel.  On March 4, as cases of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County began to increase, Block stressed to the campus community that there were   no confirmed cases at UCLA at the time. Meanwhile,   LA County  declared a local emergency  after six new cases emerged in the county in only 48 hours. Thus, while the UCLA administration tried to diminish the panic, LA County worked to underline the threat of the situation.  Keeping this disparity in mind, the question then becomes: Why did UCLA share such a different message than the county in which it is located?   Well, it looks like it is a distinction rooted in audience.  An  EPJ Data Science  study stated that news outlets usually pick and choose who they wish to reach and who they would rather leave unrepresented. For local newspapers, this is typically based on their geographic reach  as in, they want to cover stories that their reporters can easily access and that are relevant to their local audience.  For instance, a source like the LA Times has a geographic reach within LA County and likely centers much of its content based on this specific audience and the content they're seeking. Universities, however, dont have to think so hard when determining their audience. Block's messages are intended for the UCLA community, and thus have a natural emphasis on the status of the community, rather than on the entire county.  As a result, when discussing the eventual emergence of COVID-19 cases in the UCLA community, Blocks messages continued to be tailored to his specifically chosen recipients. On March 16, Block shared that a UCLA campus community member tested positive for COVID-19. However, his message also contained reassurances.  Above all, please know that every decision we make is guided by our top priority of protecting the health and safety of our Bruin and global communities, Block said in his March 16 email.  Despite having to be the bearer of bad news, this message suggests that Block still aims to boost community morale   where possible. In contrast,   in one of LA County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer's statements regarding coronavirus cases, the delivery of bad news came unaccompanied.  Just because you dont see a case in your community doesnt mean you arent going to see a case there tomorrow,"" Ferrer said in an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News. ""And more importantly it doesnt mean there may not be people in your community who might have COVID-19 but are not diagnosed.  Clearly and bluntly, Ferrer's statement draws attention to the dangers of the virus and its immediate threat to communities across the county.  UCLA communication professor Tim Groeling said that these contrasts in messages and message delivery may stem from the university's deeper connection to its readers: the students, faculty and staff.    The university is not just an organization that is communicating, but it is an organization that is taking on the responsibility for the welfare of the students and the staff and the people who work there, a little more directly, Groeling said.  The responsibility Groeling mentioned carries through in most situations, but particularly when communicating about campus closures. For instance, when Block announced March 10 that all in-person activities would be suspended until April 10, he applied a more hopeful and positive outlook.  ""This will not be a perfect transition; however, it will not change who we are and what we do, Block said in the email.  Additionally, Groeling explained that independent   news organizations typically report things that are observed by them, rather than things that are caused by them. For example, the LA Times posted  an article  that mentioned UCLA officials and their close watch on public health reports, yet at the time no official closures had been announced, and the LA Times was left to speculate. In contrast, any message that comes from the university is not only a message but also a policy that will have a significant impact on the lives of students, faculty and staff, as well as on the broader community.  This impact in turn plays a role in UCLA's determination of its plans for the future, specifically for fall quarter. In Block's most recent update, from   April 28, he refrained from making any definitive plans or promises for fall quarter. Ultimately, his verdict will be consequential for thousands of community members  their travel plans, housing circumstances and even job security.  ""While we are all eager to see UCLA return to normal operations, the health and safety of our entire campus community must continue to guide our decisions,"" Block said in the statement to the campus community. ""We are weighing various factors and scenarios for the 202021 academic year, gathering data and working closely with public health officials before making any decisions.""  Other UC figures and campuses, though, have been quicker in communicating more definite decisions.  ""Every campus will be open and offering instruction, said UC President Janet Napolitano, according to a May 20  Mercury News article . The question will be how much of that instruction is in-person versus how much is done remotely.  Additionally, UC San Diego   offered  a promising proposal  for mass student testing, in hopes of reopening in the fall.  As these different messages from different sources grow and accumulate, so does the impatience and frustration among students. However, behind all the criticism of     indecision, there lies a genuine tension between immediacy and contingency for the UCLA administration.  University of Illinois professor Nikki Usher wrote  in her book  that online news production is largely pressured by immediacy  meaning quick and constant news updates. This pressure has become a value   that is integral to news work and its mission of keeping the public abreast of the latest information.  Although other sources appear to be filling in more gaps   about the future for readers, Groeling explained that what universities like UCSD did and what UCLA will end up doing   will likely be similar  UCSD just runs the risk of overpromising, Groeling said.  In other words, even if some of us are sitting behind our screens anxiously waiting for the next email, we can respect the different factors that go into the UCLA administration's and other universities'   decision making and hope that the delivery of good news for the future will be able to come to fruition.  So, to whoever said communication is easy, that might be so  unless it applies to a university of more than 45,000 students during a pandemic.",['cap-rachel-sarrafzadeh'],"['campus-quad', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/quad.gradissue.covidcommunicationedit01-578x1024.png

Much to the  dismay of a handful of her male listeners    who wouldve preferred a traditional record rollout, the Paramore singer forged her own staggered solo debut release plan. And her 15-track album does what many cannot through its tactful three-part separation and track order. It takes listeners on a deeply personal journey through her nearly decade-long relationship, segmented perfectly to unite and show her independence from the opinions of men, romantic relationships and the pressure of the public eye.  The 10 songs that make up the first two   sections hit listeners ears in the first few months of the year. With the final third releasing Friday to complete the album,    the mainly R&amp;B- and soft-pop-influenced record effectively guides its narrative as Williams experienced it herself over time.  And despite pushback she received from male fans on Twitter, by stretching her release over a span of time rather than all at once, the aggressive tones of album opener Simmer seamlessly   morphed to the darker songs such as the 10th track Why We Ever   and   proved fruitful for storytelling. Rather than bulk listening, listeners were prompted to experience Williams own feelings   as they unfolded slowly in her own life.  But immediately snapping into a clear and tumultuous   storyline, the slow and bass-dominant Leave it Alone finds Williams in a state of self-reflection. Over her creamy vocals, the singer contemplates her own mortality in tandem with those around her. Even while feeling relatively emotionally satisfied, she grapples with loss. Confused and stumbling, she sings Now that I finally wanna live / The ones I love are dying.   [Related:    Album review: Dua Lipas Future Nostalgia wows with throwback disco sound and relevant themes   ]   Such visceral feelings about losing those around her lead Williams into the only place she feels relatively safe  the confinement of her own home. And its moments like these, when the singer is truly alone and contemplative, that she can process her own emotions to unload them on listeners. The third track, ""Cinnamon,"" acts as an ode to both the singer's own home and her dog Alf, successfully bringing a playful energy to balance the album's somber opening.  Almost asynchronous drums also bounce perfectly behind lazily drifting oohs"" and ahhs"" ringing out in each chorus. The tracks bridge offers a welcome confidence from Williams, suddenly picking up the tempo as she victoriously proclaims Im not lonely / I am free. She relishes   the comfort she feels in her home to be feminine, embracing   her freedom for self-expression   in ways she can't always do while being judged in her celebrity spotlight.  But Williams isnt unrealistic. She weighs the pros of being alone with her genuine want for human, romantic connection with fifth track Sudden Desire. While the song follows the same simplistic and relatively stripped back opening as others before it, its   explosive and gritty chorus save it from blending into surrounding tracks. The bombastic belting also helps communicate   the singers quick realization of her unanticipated yearning.  Quickly faced with romantic fallout, Petals for Armor masters the portrayal of love, heartbreak and what it means to be a woman catering to public's judgment. Williams is strikingly honest in a voice memo that opens the reggae beats of Dead Horse, wherein she shares that exploring her love life has left her in a depression, but ... trying to come out of it."" While scattering coy allusions to past positive songs shes written about the lover who left her in such a state, Williams accepts that when her relationships end, they leave her suffering in the public eye.  But ultimately this is what her career has destined her for    leaving her ex-lover with yet another song to their name.   [Related:    Album review: All Time Low honors its past, delves into more mature themes in Wake Up, Sunshine   ]   And   Williams is strongest on her debut solo record when she contemplates such   paradoxical ideas  because although love is what she craves, it is not what makes her stronger. Roses/Lotus/Violet/Iris   and Watch Me While I Bloom both pair minimalist kick drum and hi-hat beats with a bassline-heavy sequence to let the singers self-reflection take priority.  In the former, Williams cleverly presents a play on the classic Roses are Red, Violets are Blue poem, applying it to her experience with relationships in which she is the rose and her lover is the violet. She refuses to make her identity dependent on the circumstances of a man being in her life just because, He loves me now, he loves me not. And Watch Me While I Bloom echoes the positive results of such a self-dependent mindset, as she asks listeners to watch her while she takes   her roots out of the ground and instead reaches for the sky.  Though she has garnered criticism for her release methods and has faced hardship from her years both in and out of the spotlight, Williams finds room to share the   inspiring positivity in Petals for Armor's""   brighter tracks. The 80s-style groovy basslines   and layered drums of Over Yet stand to remind listeners that while heartbreak, loss and struggle are cyclical in nature, self-value is what is most important to stay positive and get out of your head.  Petals For Armor steps outside of anything Paramore fans have seen from Williams in her usual frontwoman role. Her ability to be unapologetically introspective is enough to keep anyone coming back for more   heartbreaking lyrical revelations.",['cap-brooke-cuzick'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/petals.courtesy.jpg

But staying true to its name, Social Art Project found a way to put the ""social"" in social distancing with its Spring Sing performance.  The duo, officially composed of fourth-year students Matthew Gilbert and Alena Abella, will play Carole, an original song about maintaining relationships despite physical distance. Though Gilbert, a musicology student, selected the tune before the shift to   online learning, he said COVID-19 has brought the songs message into a new context for seniors. The online performance will include video and audio submissions sent to the duo by fellow students to capture the songs message about community existing across distances, he said.  People are isolated right now, but students are missing out on potentially their last quarter and are missing their friends, Gilbert said. So (the song) has taken on a second meaning of Can we still love each other and be part of a community with each other when were not seeing each other day to day?  Spring Sings transition to virtual performances left the duo responsible for submitting a video to accompany the track. Seeing an opportunity to create a sense of community, financial actuarial mathematics student Abella said they decided to reach out to students for short video clips that capture experiences from their time on campus, like a crowd rushing the basketball court after a game-winning shot.  Winter quarter was our last quarter being at UCLA and we didnt know it, Abella said. Now Carole has kind of evolved into a love song to UCLA and how were navigating what its like being far away. Because of the meaning of our song and the name of our act, we wanted to create an actual social art project.  The clips will not just represent the experiences of one particular friend group, but instead will capture many different facets of the campus community, Gilbert said. To achieve their goal of displaying diverse stories within the video, he said he asked students to promote the submission request on social media    ultimately reaching students with about three degrees of separation from the duo.  But the social collaboration inherent to its performance will reach beyond the visuals.  As a duo, Social Art Project was originally supposed to feature only the members voices while Gilbert played the guitar. But Gilbert said he sent the recorded performance to friends and encouraged them to layer on new instrumentation as they saw fit, hoping to capitalize on the freedom afforded by the online platform.  (Gilbert) asked me if I was interested in adding a little of my music to the song (they) recorded, said fourth-year ethnomusicology student Sebastian Jones. So I used what I had at my disposal in my bedroom here.  Some of the instrumentation he sent to Gilbert includes bass, guitar and electric piano. And while the final mixing is up to Social Art Project, Jones said he made sure his additions didn't play too many notes within the range of its vocals. The song finds beauty in its existence as a simple recording between the two performers, not overdone chords or lyrics, he said. Random Voices A Cappella will also lend its vocals to later parts of the track, Gilbert said, but the singing will still mostly be done by Abella and himself.  The jury was originally out on whether Social Art Project would be allowed to compete with this version, however. It had to get permission from Spring Sing to include the additional vocals and instrumentation because a duet is typically just two performers. But Gilbert said the additions eventually got approved and will be included in the performance.  Despite this original uncertainty, Gilbert said the digital medium has allowed the duo freedom to experiment with how it wants to present Carole. Social Art Project's goal is to reignite the sense of community within a now-virtual UCLA through the performance, Abella said.  I hope our act, video and song are able to bring the community together, Abella said. Its a narrative I feel like a lot of UCLA students can relate to. We all come from different backgrounds from a lot of places in the world, and were all trying to maintain those relationships that can be pretty distant.",['cap-eli-countryman'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Socialartproject-1.jpg

As Daily Bruin&#8217;s Social Media director. My work is often at the intersection of digital multimedia and traditional content &#8288;&#8211; we work with the story every day, but we don&#8217;t actually report on it.  But that&#8217;s not the only reason why. To tell you the truth, much of my time at The Bruin was plagued by a bad case of imposter syndrome.  I believed that I couldn&#8217;t call myself a director if I made mistakes. I didn't want to put @dailybruin in my bio if I showed how inexperienced I was in the newsroom. For the first half of my tenure, I was so focused on making sure I didn't mess up instead of taking risks and pushing my section forward.  But then, I&#8217;m reminded of why I applied in the first place &#8211; the thrill of sending out a breaking story, the satisfaction of writing and producing an Instagram story from start to finish and talking digital and social media with people who love it as much as I do. I&#8217;m reminded of what drew me to this position and why I kept coming back to Kerckhoff 118.  There were the little things too: hours in a car singing along to Lorde&#8217;s ""Melodrama,"" book trades with friends, inside jokes and deep conversations exchanged through Slack messages.  I&#8217;ve made a home at the Daily Bruin. Collaboration is what drives the newsroom, and I&#8217;ve never felt more energized in what I do than when I&#8217;m working with some of my favorite people. From covering huge stories to brainstorming fun content and posts with my friends, it&#8217;s these moments that made me feel like I belonged.  A quarter, some existential crises and many appreciative Slack messages later, I&#8217;m &#8288;&#8211; finally &#8288;&#8211; proud of myself. I won a California College Media Association award for Best Social Media Reporting during the Getty fire. I&#8217;ve produced content I&#8217;m proud of. I helped create social media accounts and taught the newsroom about how to use Twitter to engage with their work and add depth to their reporting.  I&#8217;ve written some pretty funny meows, too.  It's hard to stop replaying a movie of one&#8217;s mistakes in the back of one&#8217;s head after a professional stumble. But working in social media, and at The Bruin, has taught me that there is no straightforward method that leads to a perfect end result. Errors are normal, corrections happen and we&#8217;re all human. I wish I learned that sooner, but I&#8217;ll be sure to carry that knowledge with me as I enter the corporate world.  I no longer ask myself if I&#8217;ve earned the title or replay those mistakes in the back of my head. Being a journalist entails sharing the stories that matter to your community &#8211; and sometimes that&#8217;s through a tweet or an Instagram story.  To my team, thank you for trusting me to be your Social Media director this year. I&#8217;m incredibly honored to work with such dedicated and talented individuals &#8288;&#8211; I'm constantly inspired by your writing and your pitches, and I had a lot of fun working with you all and watching you grow. Lena and Shirley, I&#8217;m so excited to see how you&#8217;ll push the section forward next year and make it even more #digital-first.  To my #getaway-car, Lena, Lucy and Andrea: Maybe it&#8217;s the feeling of driving 20 miles with almost no gas or the exhilaration of screaming into the mountains, but driving to Mammoth with all of you changed everything for the better. Through the ups and downs of this year, I&#8217;m glad I stuck with you.  To Copy, my patron saints of patience as I learned through my corrections and edits: You've saved me countless times, and I imagine that you'll save me once again when you're editing this column. You are, without a doubt, one of the most valuable sections at The Bruin.  To Sam Joseph, my long-suffering collaborator and honorary assistant Social Media director long before there was such a position: My gratefulness to you deserves more words than this column would allow. You can chart our relationship by the number of Instagram stories we&#8217;ve created and tight deadlines we managed to survive to the other side of. I&#8217;m glad we have a visual reminder of not just the late nights, but of how far we&#8217;ve come from the first time we worked together. I can&#8217;t wait to see what you come up with as PRIME&#8217;s art director.  And to Kristie-Valerie Hoang, my Social Media mom and #digital-first nerd: Dude, you already know. Your support knows no bounds, and I&#8217;m grateful for your guidance through the highs and lows of our last year. You continue to inspire me with your passion and dedication to audience engagement. Text me when you get a Pulitzer.  Thanks, Daily Bruin, for choosing me to be your 2019-2020 Social Media director. I&#8217;ll see you online.

UCLA baseball junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers with the 20th pick of the 2020 MLB Draft. It is the highest a Bruin has been selected since then-junior right-hander James Kaprielian was drafted 16th overall by the New York Yankees in 2015.&nbsp;    The selection marks the second consecutive draft with a Bruin picked in the first round, with then-junior first baseman Michael Toglia going to the Colorado Rockies 23rd overall in 2019.    Mitchell played in all 15 of the Bruins games in the shortened 2020 season and batted .355/.425/.484 out of the leadoff spot. He hit six doubles and a triple, and stole five bases.    Coming out of Orange Lutheran High School   in Orange, California, Mitchell was a highly-touted prospect, but because of his high price tag and concerns about his Type 1 diabetes, he fell to the 14th round of the 2017 MLB Draft, and chose not to sign with the Oakland Athletics.&nbsp;    Instead, he took the opportunity to play at UCLA where, in three years, Mitchell played in 121 games and amassed a career slash line of .327/.393/.478. His 15 triples  12 of which he hit in 2019 to set a UCLA single-season record and lead the NCAA  are the second-most in program history.    The Brewers have made the postseason two years in a row, with the team losing to the eventual World Series champion the Washington Nationals in the wild card game last season. Mitchell  the lone UCLA baseball alum in the Brewers organization  will join an organization that has outfield depth in the likes of 2018 National League MVP Christian Yelich, 2019 Gold Glove winner Lorenzo Cain and 2007 NL Rookie of the Year and 2011 NL MVP Ryan Braun.    When professional baseball returns in America, it is unlikely that a Minor League Baseball season will happen, and thus, Mitchell might not be paid to play until 2021 at the earliest. MLB and the MLB Players Association are still negotiating a deal to play an abbreviated season, but the two sides have yet to reach an agreement.

Spring quarter meetings will take place virtually on Zoom; links for the meetings can be found on the Internal Vice President&#8217;s Facebook  page . Watch a livestream of the meetings on the  USAC Live! channel  on YouTube.    Public Comment:    California Public Interest Research Group at UCLA is creating a grant for professors to switch to free open resource textbooks, said Joseph Matveyenko, a CALPIRG representative. CALPIRG wants to make textbooks more affordable and accessible to students, said Matveyenko, a first-year political science and Russian studies student.    Prabhdeep Rai, a third-year history student, said there is no forum for UCLA Transportation student drivers to voice their concerns about their job. There is only one van currently available because the other van was taken off service, Rai said.      Special Presentations:    Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Monroe Gorden Jr. said that two Community Programs Office committees, the Student Initiated Outreach Committee and the Campus Retention Committee, may have been in noncompliance with their statements of understanding, or SOUs, which are the committees&#8217; governing documents. USAC has requested that the two committees, which collectively control over $2.7 million in student fees, release comprehensive budget reports. Gordon said he should be held accountable for any violations of the SOUs.     The council voted March 10 to withhold about $800,000 from the SIOC and CRC until comprehensive budget reports are presented. USAC General Representative 1 Eduardo Velazquez said that although USAC received basic budget reports, they are not detailed enough. Associate Dean of Students Debra Geller said that the council cannot divert the student fees withheld to new purposes, and it is unclear whether the council has the authority to delay the funding.     The Community Service Mini Fund is expanding its guidelines for funding because of the coronavirus outbreak, said Angela Li, the fund&#8217;s chair. The fund will now also fund virtual programming, care packages and resources for community partners, said Li, a third-year economics and sociology student.      Agenda:    The council allocated a total of $644 from the Contingency Programming Fund to non-USAC groups.    The council allocated a total of $11,000 from The Green Initiative Fund to USAC and non-USAC groups.    The council approved a bylaw change that changes the use of surplus funds from the Community Service Commission. The CSC surplus will now be used for a new transportation fund for service organizations. The bylaw previously required that surpluses be split between an endowment fund for the Robert S. Michaels Leadership in Service Award and directly fund the John H. Sarvey Service Award. However, the Michaels award is currently funded through annual donations, and the Sarvey award does not need additional funding.      Reports:   President Robert Watson said his office met with University of California President Janet Napolitano and discussed the University&#8217;s plans for responding to the novel coronavirus outbreak. Napolitano said plans for fall quarter have not been finalized, but will be decided by each campus chancellor based on guidelines that will be published by the UC Office of the President, Watson said. He also said his office met with Gordon and Afrikan Student Union chair Alexandria Davis about the implications of the potential passage of the Cultivating Unity for Bruins referendum on the proposed Black Resource Center. Watson added that his office met with Chancellor Gene Block about the referenda threshold, which sets the minimum number of student signatures needed to put a referendum on the USAC ballot.     Internal Vice President Kimberly Bonifacio said her office is planning to meet with Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck to discuss how student representatives to the Public Safety Advisory Council will be selected.     External Vice President Johana Guerra Martinez said her office has released the Racial Justice Now grant applications, which funds student organizations that conduct advocacy work on racial justice issues. She added her office will be conducting student Regent interviews and sending its recommendations to UCOP on Saturday.     General Representative 2 Orion Smedley said his office is categorizing item descriptions on the USAC budget report.     General Representative 3, Brandon Broukhim said his office met with local community leaders to help students and businesses facing hardships due to the coronavirus outbreak.     Campus Events Commissioner Tara Steinmetz said her office held its first Instagram Live remote concert series Tuesday, and will hold more remote concerts two to three times a week for the rest of the academic year. She also said that her office will hold a livestream event with Antoni Porowski from Queer Eye on May 9.     Transfer Representative Isabel Oraha said her office will work with the UCLA Transfer Leadership Coalition on a May 16 Bruin Bound webinar for student activism.     Christina Read, a proxy for the Student Wellness Commission, said Active Minds will hold weekly meetings with mental health experts.     Community Service Commissioner Jonathan Wisner said his office has disbursed all available funds to the USAC COVID-19 Relief Fund, SWC COVID-19 Student Relief Fund and Books for Bruins. He added that the 10 recipients of the Robert S. Michaels Leadership in Service Award have been announced.

Property and business owners created the association in 2011 to provide the Village with functions the city of Los Angeles could not provide. The WVIA board of directors held its May 7 meeting virtually over Zoom. All future board and committee meetings will be held virtually as well.   Announcements   A WVIA  initiative  to support local restaurants and offer free meals to frontline workers at UCLA Health raised over $13,000, said Executive Director Andrew Thomas. The initiative successfully started distributing food on April 23 and will engage in another round of distributions using excess funds soon, he added.   Board member Paige Reilly resigned from the board to pursue other career prospects, Thomas said.    Agenda Items    Board member Kevin Crummy invited a new stakeholder to join the board. Renee Fortier, executive director of UCLA Events &amp; Transportation, took over a merchant board seat previously held by Brad Erickson, an executive director at UCLA.  The board unanimously declined to increase assessments, which are essentially association-managed property taxes for business in the Village. Thomas recommended the board not increase assessments, the primary source of income for the WVIA, because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on local businesses.  Zuriel Espinosa, a city of Los Angeles city planning associate, presented options to alter the Westwood Village Specific Plan, a zoning and regulatory framework for the area. The options focused on altering definitions for food establishments and parking requirements, per a Sept. 13, 2019 city council motion.  The board unanimously recommended city planning remove fast food and restaurant definitions from the Specific Plan to enable a variety of food establishments to set up in the Village. The board also unanimously recommended city planning remove ratios &#8211; restrictions on the number of different food establishments on a street &#8211; from the plan.   The board unanimously recommended the removal of several parking requirements including those for historic buildings, parking replacement requirements and area requirements for hotels, motions pictures, nightclubs and offices. Additionally, the board asked for the removal of parking requirements when a location changes from one type of business to another. Rather than enforce these Specific Plan requirements, the board recommended city planning apply citywide general zoning code requirements.  The board unanimously recommended city planning allow businesses to lease parking spaces rather than enter into stricter covenant agreements because leases would be more favorable to landlords. Likewise, the board unanimously recommended city planning increase the allowable distance for off-site parking options from 1,000 feet to 1,320 feet.  ",[],"['news', 'westwood']",

The annual music, dance and comedy event organized by the Student Alumni Association went live to computer screens around the world Friday night. Since Spring Sing's decision of moving to an online format to abide with COVID-19-induced social distancing regulations, contestants began pre-recording video performances to be debuted during the event's live stream. And between storytelling performances and comedy sketches making light of the difficulties of studying at home, Spring Sing 2020 united a scattered student body   for   the   annual tradition.  Despite taking on an entirely new platform, this year's event maintained the same format as years past. The live stream   weaved its way through solo, duet, band and dance performances while interspersing sketches from the   comedy group Company between each musical number.  To open the show, soloist Akshay Anand, a third-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student, showcased his track entitled ""Years"" accompanied by a pastel   video of him playing his acoustic guitar on a sunset hike.  Nature was prominent part of other performances   as well,   including that by duo Jet Talandis and Xander Ambrose, a third-year human biology and society student and a first-year theater student, respectively. The pair used the video for their original song ""River"" to create a visual narrative to pair with their lyrics. As Talandis sang, ""I go down to the river to watch it burn all my troubles and all my hurt,"" viewers could watch the story unfold through black and white shots of him running through a forest towards water.  Aside from these visuals of nature, some   larger groups utilized split-screen effects to effectively showcase each of their members. Even physically separated, groups such as Signature A Cappella found ways to make its performance feel united. In   its mash up of Destiny's Child's ""Survivor"" and Kesha's ""Praying,"" the all-girl group appeared as a grid of individual videos, with the singers collectively looking at each soloist throughout the song.  Similarly, the band Wild Phlox's music video for its song ""If Only,"" began with each of the members playing in different parts of the same house and concluded with them dancing from separate locations on the same video call.   Between each performance, Company members were sure to chime in with sketches mainly focusing on the social implications of COVID-19 with themes   centered upon video-chat technology. The sketches ranged from students traveling back to UCLA via video background, awkward moments of group-project members struggling to mute their microphones and a romance unfolding   in quarantine on Club Penguin.   However, as in years   past, the group ended with a   UCLA-themed song parody.   This year, i  n their rendition of ""Seasons of Love"" from the Broadway musical ""Rent,"" Company members lamented about the 115,200 minutes that students have been away from campus, but   they were sure to note that Spring Sing was a way to bring them back together again.   Following that trend, Social Art Project, composed of  fourth-year musicology student Matthew Gilbert and fourth-year financial actuarial mathematics student Alena Abella, delivered a similar sentiment in its performance of its song &#8220;Carole.&#8221; Sepia-toned videos from UCLA's early days faded into clips of current students on Janss Steps and at Rose Bowl football games as the pair finished the video by coming together to sing the lyrics ""Can I still love you from so far away?""  These tones faded into the show's intermission break, where viewers were given a glimpse of this year's celebrity mentors coaching their performers during the filming process. Outside of performance advice from artists such as Young the Giant singer Sameer Gadhia and choreographer Tamica Washington-Miller, UCLA's former gymnastics coach Valorie Kondos Field took a moment to encourage the musicians she mentored by   relating the impact of their performances to the world at large as it faces quarantine and COVID-19 precautions.  &#8220;We are going to be a beacon for how to move forward ... in our new chapter with tenacity, courage and enthusiasm, and let's not forget gratitude,&#8221; Kondos Field said.  After more solo, duo and band performances, along with videos by a capella group Scattertones and dance group ICARUS Contemporary Dance Co &#8211; which both featured pre-recorded content of the groups united &#8211; the l    ive streamed   show came to a close.  The website's live comment section continued to fill with viewers' reactions during the show's final moments. And in lieu of Spring Sing's usual awards, it will only be presenting its Bruin Choice Award this year. The prize will be calculated based on how many likes each performer's video receives on YouTube in the coming week, with the winner officially being announced June 5.

In a world in isolation, UCLA musicians &#8211; students and alumni alike &#8211; continue to hone their craft. A lifestyle often characterized by solitude has been the source for many musicians&#8217; sudden boost in creativity. Similarly, artists are using the extra time that comes with staying indoors to pursue new projects like music production or venturing into different forms of composition. Fourth-year communication student Krista Apardian said this space for self-reflection encourages her to create music as a form of catharsis.  &#8220;I honestly find myself being way more creative than usual because there&#8217;s no social temptation to go hang out with friends or things like that,&#8221; Apardian said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also a time that kind of forces being introspective upon you.&#8221;  Social isolation can prompt contemplation, which has been ideal for creativity, Apardian said. Aside from continuing her songwriting and recording ideas in her home setup, she said she is working to become more self-sufficient as an artist, which includes producing her own music. A brief pause from the hectic nature of everyday life resulted in the most opportune time to experiment with doing so, she said.   &#8220;I always enjoyed production, but now I&#8217;m in the phase of actually producing my own stuff,&#8221; Apardian said. &#8220;This has been the perfect time for me to explore my voice as a producer because I already understand and know what my voice is as a writer and a vocalist.&#8221;   [Related:    Scattered Bruins: International students from China explore new art forms while in isolation   ]     As a vocalist performing under the name Krista Marina, she was originally scheduled to perform at Fowler Out Loud on April 8, which has since been converted to a livestream. Though Apardian said this new medium may limit her ability to connect with her audience by making eye contact or feeding off its energy, she hopes that it will be a more intimate performance.  With national stay-at-home orders, such livestreams garner increasing popularity among artists who still seek a way to share live music. Caroline Pernick, a third-year musical theater student, has performed original music in student-organized concerts and open mics on platforms like Zoom, Facebook Live and Twitch. Regardless of the platform, Pernick said the online medium, combined with peoples&#8217; recently cleared schedules and the simple logistics of playing from home, unites a much more diverse group of artists than physical performances.  &#8220;The reach is just bigger &#8211; the net can be cast wider in terms of who is there,&#8221; Pernick said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been really cool to see everyone in one place at one time because, for the first time, we have no excuse not to be.&#8221;  Since the beginning of quarantine, Pernick said she has noticed a significant spike in activity and collaboration in the arts community. Many musicians are trying to raise societal morale by continuing to create, she said, which has inspired her to write songs more. Using this newfound free time, Pernick said she is challenging herself to arrange an hourlong set of original music to share in performances after quarantine.  For other musicians like alumna Robin Li, it has been a privilege to use this extra time to process life through music, she said. Being forced to stay home has allowed her to return to piano composition, which she said she quit three years ago. Yet after so long, Li said writing piano music continues to be a key method of expressing herself and her thoughts.  &#8220;(My music represents) what I&#8217;ve been seeing in daily life &#8211; I guess I want to digest it,&#8221; Li said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been seeing a lot in 2020. People are suffering and we were forced to quarantine. There&#8217;s a lot going on and you want to express your feelings.&#8221;   [Related:    Second Take: Online live performances proliferate, revitalize highly restrictive music industry   ]   The opportunity to slow down and reflect has also granted Li the chance to seriously pursue her goal of composing film scores, she said. With her current repertoire of original piano music as a starting point, Li said she uses GarageBand to practice converting her solo pieces into orchestral arrangements. Her musical background is exclusively in piano, but she said she is teaching herself orchestral composition using YouTube videos.  &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot for me to learn,&#8221; Li said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never played strings or woodwinds. I (only) hear music of how these instruments are played and how they would accompany a piano. (But) we have this opportunity to quarantine, ... (in which) you probably want to improve some skills.&#8221;  Whether it is branching out into new areas of music or working on long-term artistic goals, many musicians are seeking to maximize the benefits of their time in quarantine. The drive to create is at the core of their actions, Pernick said, even though conditions may not be ideal.  &#8220;It&#8217;s all under the purpose of still continuing to create art and cultivate creativity in a time where we&#8217;re all shut in our houses,&#8221; Pernick said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s the really nice thing about being an artist &#8211; you don&#8217;t lose your craft because it&#8217;s always with you.&#8221; ",['cap-vivian-xu'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/IMG_9632.jpg

There&#8217;s a lot I could say about my athletic career here &#8211; playing in a national championship game, making it all the way to two College Cups and developing into an athlete that was capable of being drafted into a professional organization. However, that&#8217;s not what I want to talk about.   I was born Black. I never had the option of not being Black.  I could write a whole new piece about my experiences while being Black, but that would take too many characters for this. I got accepted into UCLA while playing a predominantly white sport, and coming from a predominantly white neighborhood. Though my experiences before college definitely shaped who I am, I full-heartedly believe that UCLA transformed me into the powerful Black woman I was always destined to be.  Here&#8217;s how:  It gave me a space to develop my empathy. I was surrounded by  people of all different creeds, colors, backgrounds, sexual orientations, gender expressions and religions. I was able to have uncomfortable conversations that helped me grow as a person and showed me new ways of thinking. Being on campus gave me the opportunity  to put myself in many different pairs of shoes and gave me an appreciation for the perspectives of others.  It gave me a space to create my circle of trust. I found people  who supported me and people who didn&#8217;t. I was able to reflect on my own values and apply them when choosing the people I wanted to surround myself with. I found coaches, teachers and leaders that I trusted, and eventually made them my mentors. UCLA introduced  me to many of the people that will be important to me for the rest of my life.  It gave me a space to find my voice. Though I was always very  vocal in my beliefs, my experiences while at UCLA encouraged me to be even louder. Empowered with an elite education and experience, I felt even more confident in the beliefs I held and more energized to speak up about the injustices I saw all around me.  It gave me a space to find my platform. Kneeling in solidarity  with Colin Kaepernick during my sophomore year &#8211; and for the rest of my career &#8211; was one of the scariest and most empowering things I&#8217;ve ever done in my life. UCLA gave me a way to protest police brutality and encouraged me when I chose to do so.  Most importantly, it challenged me. Every aspect of my morality,  my thinking and my conscience was tested and transformed in one way or another. For that I&#8217;m thankful.   There&#8217;s a lot more to be said about my experience at UCLA, but  what is most important to me right now is making sure that the police officers who kill unarmed Black Americans are brought to justice. UCLA enhanced my ability to stand up for what I believe in and express what I am passionate about, and I think the lessons I learned there are perfectly exemplified in that belief. I hope the acceptance of my activism during my experience at UCLA as a Black student-athlete continues to be the precedent the university keeps when supporting others who choose to walk the same path.

I'm the outgoing Sports editor, soon-to-be senior staffer at the Daily Bruin. Today, I'm joined by a few of our graduating seniors in Daily Bruin Sports to talk about the last four years, the past year and what can come next. So starting off we have Ryan Smith, he was the Sports editor from 2017 to 2018, who's a senior staffer this year. And then we have Angie Forburger, who was an assistant Sports editor from 2017 to 2018 and she was the editor in chief of the Daily Bruin this year. Then we are joined by Marcus Veal, first time on the podcast. Marcus has been a staff writer for the Daily Bruin the last year, and he's been on a bunch of different beats the last four years. Yeah, like I said, it's gonna be kind of a recap and a look forward, just to kind of get your guys' perspectives as graduating seniors. So I know Ryan, you've been on the show before, you've hosted it with me. I guess let's just start off with each of you guys kind of introducing yourselves and going through how you got started   at   DB and what you've done since.   Ryan Smith:  I applied to the DB pretty much straight out of high school, got here, did it right away, was on women's basketball my freshman year, loved that year. And then went up to an assistant editor my second year, kept women's basketball, did men's and women's golf, men's water polo, helped a little bit with baseball in the spring. And then I was the top Sports editor my junior year and now I'm doing senior staff stuff. I've been doing football, men's basketball for the last two years.   SC:  I know we've gotten to work together a lot, it's been a good couple of years. And then Angie, I guess if you just want to break things down a bit, your path.   Angie Forburger:  Similar to Ryan, I joined my freshman year right away. I was on women's tennis initially, and then that was my whole freshman year. Sophomore year, I was on women's volleyball to begin with, and then halfway through sophomore year I became an assistant Sports editor. So then I took over editing for men's and women's tennis as well as beach volleyball. And then junior year I continued on as an assistant Sports editor editing women's volleyball, gymnastics, swim and dive, rowing, softball. And then yeah, this year I've been the editor in chief.   SC:  Great. We were editors together the last couple years. It's been fun. Marcus, I know you haven't taken the editor path like Ryan and Angie have. I don't know if you just want to talk about the beats you've been on your last four years?   Marcus Veal:  I also joined the paper my freshman year. I got put on cross country and women's water polo my freshman year, and then sophomore year I took a break in fall quarter just because it conflicted with band. Spring quarter I was on the softball beat and then junior year, I did men's soccer, as well as softball. And then senior year, men's soccer again. And then a little bit of baseball before it was unfortunately cut short.   SC:  Yep, like all things, it just ended a little abruptly this year, it wasn't the way we imagined. But Marcus, it's has been great working with you the past few years. Being a sports reporter at the Daily Bruin or any student paper, really, it's kind of a balancing act to show up your freshman year and you're all decked out in the UCLA gear, you're going to games, part of The Den, cheering like crazy and everything. So on that side of things  I know we're reporters and journalists  but on the fan side of things what have been your favorite moments since you've gotten to UCLA?   AF:  Can I go first? Because I'm pretty sure Ryan's gonna steal my answer. Mine's the Oregon game from our freshman year. I'm like 100% sure he was gonna say that. But yeah, that game was like by far the best. That's when we had the one year of Lonzo Ball. Pretty iconic. I remember my friend and I, we went to the Pauley lock-in right before that game, so we got seats right behind the basket. It was such a good game. Literally the best game I've ever been to as a fan, let alone at UCLA. But yeah, I just want to get that in because that was everyone's best game that I know of.   RS:  Thankfully, I came prepared with a second one. I was at a baseball game. I can't remember if it was my sophomore year or maybe my freshman year. But Nick Kern, I mean, just a short, short little second baseman. He had overcome an illness like a year prior. There's actually a feature you can read on the website by Kyle Cardoza about Nick Kern, but he hits a walk-off home run. I think it was against Oregon State. Two outs, two strikes, bottom of the ninth to beat Oregon  or I think it may be into extra innings. But I mean that moment was just unreal, just because I was aware of what Nick Kern had overcome and stuff and he was just pinch-hitting. I've been to games all year and you just never really saw them. And so that moment was just awesome. I remember being there with my roommate just having a blast.   SC:  Marcus, how about you  your favorite fan moment?   MV:  My favorite fan moment has gotta be when we beat 'SC in football. Just in recent memory USC always had the upper hand in football. And I just remember each game like these past four years being relatively close in the first half and then 'SC just carrying it the rest of the way in the second half and just the score just ended up being like a lot to a little, every outcome. But I was in the band, so I had great seats, saw everything. And it was just a crazy experience. That was one of the very few moments where I saw all of the Rose Bowl just packed and all of the Rose Bowl just excited. Ready to see a win against 'SC. I know that wins just in general were hard to come by these last four years of football but yeah, that game was just  I'll never forget it.   SC:  Yeah and then I guess at the same time, we're each journalists. We spent just as many games like collared shirts and button-downs up in press boxes and courtside than we did all decked out in UCLA gear. So I guess in your guys' four years here, what were the best or most interesting games for you to cover? I guess, Marcus, we'll start with you.   MV:  Freshman year I covered women's water polo. And before covering the team, I knew nothing about women's water polo. I knew a friend in high school that played but other than that it was just a completely new experience. And just having to learn the whole game on the fly and trying to cover it as well, it was definitely a challenging experience. But at the same time, I definitely enjoyed it. But it was the national championship game. Michael Hull, my editor, me and him went to Indiana for that tournament. We ended up losing. Steffens, Stanford's best player at the time, she scored the go-ahead goal with like nine seconds left. It was a total heartbreaker. And that was the best game that I covered because one it was a national championship, just being a part of that kind of game was incredible. But at the same time, it was also the game that really humbled me the most as a writer just because I'll never forget this: I asked the coach, Brandon Brooks at the time, I asked him a question that he did not like at all. I asked him, ""Coach, this is like the third time in four years where UCLA has fallen to Stanford. What about Stanford is so hard to beat?"" And Brandon Brooks, for the most part, is a pretty mellow dude. And he's not animated, especially when talking to the media, but that question just ticked him off and he did not like that question I asked him and so yeah, he just chewed me out but in like the most Brandon Brooks way possible. He kept his mellow voice throughout but the words he was saying, it was definitely a humble experience and it definitely shaped the aspiring sports journalist I want to become.   SC:  Nice. Ryan?   RS:  I'll always remember the Joshua Kelley explosion against USC and then I love covering the win against Stanford for football this year snapping that long  like decadelong  losing streak. But my favorite has to be the men's water polo national championship a couple years ago. I'll just never forget the moment they won all the fans, I mean, we were sitting poolside and it was at 'SC so the fans are all on top of you, basically, right behind you. And as soon as UCLA won, all the fans came jumping over the wall past Jack Perez and I. They just ran past us jumped in the pool with the team. Coach jumped in. Everything was crazy. I remember writing the wrap, just fastest I've ever written anything for the Daily Bruin. I mean, it was just hectic. It was ridiculous, but just so much happiness. And I'll never forget how excited the players were and how excited Coach was. You don't really good to see Adam Wright excited all that much. So, to see him happy, it was just a great day.   SC:  Nice. Sounds great, wholesome. Angie, what about you?   AF:  Mine would probably have to be last year as an assistant Sports editor when I traveled to Anaheim for the gymnastics Collegiate Challenge. Anyone who knows me knows how much I love our gym team. But that meet was one that I feel like everyone remembers because that was when Katelyn Ohashi did her soon-to-be-viral floor routine. And the coolest part about that was one, seeing it live and just knowing as soon as she finished that it was going to be insane, like knowing it was going to be viral, and then after the fact getting to talk with her and also Coach Val. I think that was probably the first time I'd ever interviewed Katelyn herself. I talked to Val a little bit before but that was really cool because I think in a lot of kind of big meets like that there's a lot of media and sometimes you can get lost. But I remember we were one of the only media outlets there covering it. So getting to talk to Katelyn one-on-one immediately after something that became so viral was the coolest thing and it was a cool, kind of humbling experience to feel how big Daily Bruin could be as a media outlet and how covering something that was eventually going to be that big could help us stand out a little bit.   SC:  I remember, you were there with Joy Hong, who was also an assistant Sports editor at the time. The two of you sent the video to us before it went viral. And you're like, ""Look, that's us sitting in the background, like, watch this go crazy. Everyone's gonna love this."" And then like the next day, it blew up and you guys are in it. That's the fun kind of stuff we get to do. Obviously, we don't just do game wraps and recaps at the Daily Bruin, so I know each of you has played around a little bit with features, profiles, columns and other things in your time here. I guess what would you say are your favorite stories you've written over the last four years overall, that don't necessarily have to be those game wraps?   RS:  You know, columns are fun. I've always had fun doing them. Features are great. I think my favorite experience writing a story that wasn't wrap related was probably the pro-day for Josh Rosen and the other guys that were involved that day. That was my first real football story. It was before I was the Sports editor and had the men's basketball and football duties. But I just remember being out on the practice field. I got to meet Mike Mayock, who's the general manager of the Raiders now, I was on the field with John Elway, Vance Joseph, who was the Broncos coach at the time. There were scouts all over the place. It was really just the first time, it just felt super big and felt like kind of I made it within the Daily Bruin. Josh Rosen was going to be a top 10 pick that year. The whole process, that whole day was just insane. And then I remember like, I was posting stuff on Twitter all day. I had Broncos fans tweeting me, Bills fans, any team that had a pick in the top 10 that was looking for a quarterback. Just the whole day was wild. And that was probably my favorite non-wrap related experience here.   SC:  Nice. What about you, Angie?   AF:  I would say, for me, probably the feature I wrote on Jada Hart. She was a redshirt freshman at the time. This was when I was a freshman. It was my second feature I'd written and I feel like the reason why this one stands out to me is because I had written a feature previously but what was different about this one was I really kind of got to dig into her personally and just the hardships she's been through and kind of the things that you don't really see on the surface and getting to kind of experienced that style of reporting and writing for the first time was really cool. And just seeing the whole piece come together. I remember one of my favorite things about that story was actually the art with it and just seeing how that all comes together. And then I remember that was the first story that was ever CP, as we call it, or on the front page. It was the coolest thing. I remember just getting a bunch of copies and being like wow. I worked so hard kind of on this story and to see it just all come together was so fun.   SC:  Marcus, how about you?   MV:  I think my favorite non-wrap story that I've written was my feature on Kylee and Briana Perez on the softball team. Just really learning more about their childhoods growing up and playing multiple different sports but ultimately, like both of them picking softball, and both of them playing for UCLA. It was the first time where they were both able to play on the same team because Briana, her freshman year, Kylee was a senior. And so they didn't play on the same travel ball teams, they didn't play on the same teams in middle school or high school. And so it was just really fun covering their whole process of playing multiple different sports. And Briana was the number one recruit in her class. And so that just added a whole other element of this almost lifelong process of finally being able to play softball with one another. And I remember this was my sophomore season covering softball and they were able to make the Women's College World Series. Unfortunately, they lost in I think the semifinals to the eventual champion, Florida State, but just knowing their relationship, and just how they are as people really made that year of softball really special to cover for the Daily Bruin.   SC:  It was nice seeing them win the year after, even though Kylee wasn't there. Yeah, so I guess each of you guys have obviously taken a different path, we talked about it earlier: assistant Sports editor, top Sports editor, editor in chief, senior staff, staff writer. I guess it's kind of crazy to think that there are, what, 12 years at the Daily Bruin between the three of you. And in that time, you've all gotten close to a lot of teams and covered a lot of teams. Which would you say were your favorites to cover, like your No. 1?   AF:  For me, it would have to be women's tennis  the first team I ever covered. And I think why is I was actually the only reporter on that beat. Like I kind of did all the reporting myself aside from my editor, Hanson, who did some here and there. But it was pretty much me jumping on every story. And I think what was cool about that is I've never really experienced covering a team or what that could entail. But I think with the women's tennis team, it's a very small team. There's only 10 to 12 athletes. So I think what was cool was getting to know so many of them personally, just getting to talk to them multiple times a week for previews, wraps, kind of everything, and just getting to know them as well as the coaching staff really well. And it just became a really fun experience for them to recognize me and feel comfortable with me and have this friendship established alongside this reporter-athlete relationship. And I think that was one of the coolest experiences I've had. And I think one of the things that made me really fall in love with sports journalism.   SC:  Marcus, how about you?   MV:  I think for me the favorite team that I covered was softball. Just being on that beat for two seasons. My first season, like I said earlier, just covering them up until the point where they lost in the semifinals. It was a great experience, but at the same time, it definitely wasn't the ending that anybody wanted to have. But I had such a fun season that I made it clear that I wanted to follow it for a second. And fortunately, I was able to do that. And then that next year we won the national championship. And so that was an unbelievable experience just having to cover them when they won. And just like getting to know coach Inouye-Perez a second season. She's great. I love Coach. She's definitely one of my favorite people that I've worked with at the Daily Bruin so far. Just being able to cover that team was a great experience and it definitely helped me want to become a better writer, and it definitely paved the way for me to hopefully be able to be a sports journalist as a career.   SC:  And Ryan, how about you?   RS:  Obviously, it was a great time this year with you, Sam, covering that men's basketball team, the turnaround and everything. Unfortunately, got cut short. But I think my favorite team to cover was the women's basketball team my freshman year just because the roster was just super fun to watch. They had Nicole Kornet, Kari Korver. Both of them could shoot the lights out, super likable, fun, bubbly personalities. And then they had their two killers with Jordin Canada and Monique Billings. The team was just super fun to watch. They were really good. And it was really that group that turned around that program and made them as good as they are today. They made a couple good runs in the tournaments, but obviously there's a lot of powerhouses in college women's basketball and UCLA just wasn't up to that standard yet. It would have been nice to see where that team went this year but that freshman year squad was just kind of the turning point. It was fun to cover that team and be a part of it.   SC:  There's obviously a lot that's uncertain going on right now because of coronavirus and everything else, really. Seasons finishing unfinished. But it's looking like it'll be kind of a new era of UCLA sports with Martin Jarmond coming in and Dan Guerrero now out of town. What would you guys say you're looking forward to the most in the future of UCLA Athletics with you guys taking on an alumni role now?   MV:  I'm definitely excited to have this guy coming in. He definitely made it clear that he wants to have football and basketball be a focal part and having that be a bit of a turnaround. And when I read about him, something I found pretty promising for the future is that back when he worked at Ohio State, he was part of the coach search committee and he was able to land Urban Meyer back in 2012. While I still want to remain optimistic about Chip Kelly and his time at UCLA, I think he'll be able to turn things around, but in case he doesn't, we have an athletic director with a history of being really good with being able to recruit standout names in college football. And so I think he'll do a great job.   SC:  Yeah. How about you, Ryan?   RS:  Being in a position that we're all in, you know, we hear a lot of complaining about the big sports, you know, football, men's basketball, and everyone wants to see them turn it around. But I think when you look at UCLA Athletics from a wider perspective, I mean, it's been in a good place throughout our entire time here. All the teams win, it's constantly competitive. But in terms of those two big sports I think it's pretty clear. You said men's basketball found their guy with Mick Cronin. That team was getting super exciting with what you could argue kind of an average, slightly above-average roster in terms of what you'd expect for UCLA. And then with football, like Marcus said, you want to be optimistic with Chip Kelly. We'll see how everything goes post-coronavirus. But I think Martin Jarmond's the right guy to fix that program. If Chip Kelly's not the guy, and even if Chip Kelly is the guy, I think better days are ahead for both of the big sports. And obviously we don't have to worry about the other teams because we know that they're gonna be in a competitive position year in and year out.   SC:  Angie, anything stand out to you?   AF:  What Marcus and Ryan have been saying, I think it'll be an interesting test just when sports do come back just where we're at. I think Chip has a lot to prove, and I think fans know that. So I'm interested to see kind of a role that this new AD can play in that perception. I mean, I think what we established last year with Mick Cronin is just more to come and just waiting to see if we can continue to build upon that. And I think establishing that kind of longevity and reputation that UCLA Athletics does have, just kind of trying to maintain that and work with that I think is going to be the biggest challenge for our new AD. But I think he's up to it. And it'll just be interesting to see kind of where we're at a year from now looking back.   SC:  That's about all I have for you guys, but do you have any final words with DB? I mean, I don't want to make you all emotional or anything, but is there something that you want people to know about your time here and what it meant to you?   RS:  If you're someone who's listening to this, and you're not a part of the Daily Bruin, or you're part of it already, and maybe you're not as involved in the office or with the people as you'd like to be, I mean, join, or if you're already in, go to the office, meet these people. I mean, obviously, when we get back and you're able to do that. But it's just a great group of people. It's gonna be your main network for your four years or however long you're here once you're with the Daily Bruin. It's just a whole bunch of people who are dedicated to one goal. It's a great time, you know, meeting people on the campus, meeting athletes, meeting whoever it is, whatever section you're in. It's just a great family and it's a great support system to have. Definitely recommend the Daily Bruin to anyone who has any interest in journalism or just having a good network of friends.   SC:  Angie, any parting words?   AF:  My four years have definitely been different than I would have probably envisioned them. But I feel like the Daily Bruin has been the backbone of my college experience. Like I've sort of lived in the office for the last couple years. I think the biggest thing for me is just the people and the culture that DB is that you may not even realize from the outside, and I think just getting to work with incredible editors and writers like, Sam, Ryan and Marcus. I've worked with all of you pretty closely over the last four years. And I think just getting to learn from other people and also grow yourself as a journalist and as a leader is a really cool experience. I couldn't imagine my four years without the Daily Bruin. I hope kind of, as Ryan said, that people hear this and maybe step outside of their comfort zone and being a part of DB and kind of seeing what they're capable of because I know for me, that was something I never expected, to kind of be in this position. But I'm glad I got to where I am.   MV:  Yeah, just adding on to what Ryan and Angie have already said, my time at the Daily Bruin has been incredible. Just working with you, Sam, and Ryan and Angie, you guys have been able to not only push me but just support like everything I've been involved with and really that's just a testament to how life is at the Daily Bruin. You have a bunch of people, like Ryan said, that want that same goal. Not only has the Daily Bruin helped me in terms of being a good sports journalist, but it's helped me in basically all facets of my education at UCLA, and there's not a whole lot I would change. Well, there's one thing I would change and it would be just that I wish I got to know you guys like a lot earlier and just everybody. From the bottom of my heart, I love you guys and it's been an incredible four years.   SC:  Love you too, Marcus. Thanks so much to all three of you, not only for being on the show today but for four years of DB. Also, for spending the last few years as great mentors and friends. So to Ryan, Angie, Marcus, Dylan D'Souza, Vinny Lavalsiti, Matthew Kenney, Claire Britton and rest of the class of 2020 that's been a huge part of DB Sports over the last few years, just thanks so much.","['cap-sam-connon', 'cap-ryan-smith', 'cap-angie-forburger', 'cap-marcus-veal', 'cap-kristin-snyder']","['podcasts', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/sportspodcast-dark-1024x1024.png

The gallery is part of UCLA's Lapu, the Coyote that Cares Theatre Company's celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and includes multimedia submissions   by its members and students as well as AAPI artists outside the campus community. &#8220;From the Heartland&#8221; aims to extend LCC&#8217;s mission of amplifying Asian American and Pacific Islander voices by   providing them   with   a platform to share their stories, said   Mei Tam, a third-year psychology student and the gallery's organizer. The gallery title encompasses that theme by using a play on the phrase ""from the homeland,"" she said.  &#8220;The whole point of (AAPIHM) is about honoring our identity with being Asian American,&#8221; Tam said. &#8220;No matter what, in the end, it all comes from the heart and it all comes from what we want ourselves to be.""  Tam put out a call for submissions of any medium at the beginning of the month, and she said she   has received a range of pieces since then, including everything from short films and music to short stories and paintings. One entry   came from first-year   English student and LCC member Jade Lacy, who submitted three poems she wrote.  Lacy said each one of her poems is thematically different but touches on a distinct facet of her identity. Her sonnet titled &#8220;Heroes&#8221; draws parallels between the famous terra-cotta army statues and frontline workers in the coronavirus pandemic. Her other two submissions draw from her own life &#8211; ""Powerful Sea, Peaceful Stream"" references her grandfather and mother's respective Chinese names and &#8220;Wichita Falls&#8221; is inspired by her family in Texas and her grandmother&#8217;s hometown.  &#8220;I am half Chinese and half white and I felt like I wanted to include this piece ... because, to me, that interplay between this American heritage and Chinese heritage is important when considering my identity as an Asian American,&#8221; Lacy said.   [Related Links:    Playwright Max Yu becomes first Chinese American to receive Relentless Award   ]    In her first year, Lacy has worked with poetry groups on campus and also joined LCC, where she became a part of conversations that inspired her to get more in touch with her Asian American identity.   Throughout the year, Lacy has been   discovering how she wants to talk about her identity through poetry, and the gallery offered the perfect merging of her two avenues of exploration, she said.  However, Tam   said not all submissions came from members of LCC or even UCLA students. Alisa Nascimento majors in printmaking at the University of Dallas, but went to middle school with Tam and submitted one of her works after Tam reached out on social media. Nascimento usually only presents her pieces to people at her university but said she   thought it would be meaningful to share her work with a wider audience.   [caption caption=""&quot;Appetite&quot; examines printmaking student at the University of Dallas Alisa Nascimento&#39;s connection to her heritage through food. (Courtesy of Alisa Nascimento)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_381656"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   Nascimento&#8217;s piece is a woodblock print she made earlier in the year for class in the process of developing her senior thesis show. The piece, titled &#8220;Appetite,"" plays with the theme of identity in relation to food and how Nascimento relates to her Chinese American heritage.  &#8220;As I was a kid growing up, I didn't really have a connection through language, so I found a better connection through food,&#8221; Nascimento said. &#8220;It's just a little fragment from my childhood memory of just looking into a Chinese butcher shop and seeing all the hanging meats and the huge cleaver and the giant wooden cutting board.""    [Related Links:    Alumnus to create technological retelling of Middle Eastern, South Asian stories   ]    In the same way that each artist&#8217;s submission reflects their personal experience, AAPIHM has a different meaning for every individual. AAPIHM offers an important way to spread more cultural understanding, Nascimento said, which is   something she   considers important because her school is located in a predominantly white area.    The month can also be about better understanding oneself as Lacy said she has struggled with what AAPIHM means to her personally. Her mother immigrated to the United States from Hong Kong at a young age, and as a self-described member of generation 1.5, Lacy said she always felt disconnected from Asian American and Chinese history growing up. However, she grew up in a very Asian community, and since joining LCC, she&#8217;s discovered a larger dialogue about what it means to be Asian American, she said.  Illustrating varied perspectives of heritage and identity, &#8220;From the Heartland&#8221; will fully launch as a webpage Thursday, just before the end of AAPIHM. Tam said she hopes the gallery both honors the AAPI artists it features and allows people to see how creative the AAPI community can be.   ""When a lot of people think about Asian Americans, they always think about the whole model minority image ... but we're so much more than this narrative,&#8221; Tam said. &#8220;I hope people can see that we're finally taking the narrative into our own hands and writing our own stories.&#8221; ",['cap-olivia-mazzucato'],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.aapigallery.AK_.jpg

The coronavirus pandemic has and will transform social norms and reestablish arbitrary boundaries set for the sake of medical research. Prior to this, the mere thought of tracing folks was an unthinkable and invasive method that violated ones right to privacy; today, it has become something folks, regardless of ones political beliefs, have come to believe merits consideration.  The following question comes to mind: Is it appropriate to alter the boundaries of the intervention by tracking ones daily life for the sake of containment?  Simply stated, yes, now more than ever it is appropriate to take the initiative for containment. However, it is important to note the implications of the actions proposed by UCLA, UC San Francisco and the California Department of Public Health on different communities. UCLA, UCSF and CDPH stress the foundational basis that contact tracing wields in terms of infectious disease control, especially in light of numerous states in the United States slowly starting to return to pre-COVID-19 days. In spite of its necessity, many remain weary of the implications such actions, such as revealing immigration status, may impose on certain demographics post-COVID-19.  Although Susan Philips, an infectious disease specialist at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, emphasizes the lack of inquiry in terms of participants immigration statuses, such statements should be repeatedly analyzed and reiterated for the general population to encourage their confidence and comfort with these measures. This is crucial because while folks with documentation do not stand in fear of any harmful repercussions of these actions on their status in the U.S., many will remain hesitant as they worry about both direct and indirect repercussions.  COVID-19 has opened up a can of worms to say the very least. What exactly this means for us as individuals across the world depends on the diverse and specific circumstances we face. For now, only time can tell.   Valles is a second-year microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics student and a campaign coordinator for California Public Interest Research Group Students.

These feelings are especially profound for the graduating class of 2020, and as uncertain as the past couple of months have been, the emotions of a typical spring quarter are still the same. We have collectively made it through a spring like no other &#8211; one that saw the campus emptied like Rieber Hall during a fire drill but with little or no time to say goodbye to the people, places and experiences that are so much a part of our Bruin lives.   For athletes, the abrupt end to their seasons brought an immeasurable amount of grief and a sense of loss that is hard to put into words, even months later. For performers who worked all year for recitals, plays, et cetera, the loss was no less profound. For those who lost someone to COVID-19, the pain lingers along with a sense that as the rest of us look forward to getting back to a new normal, your life may never feel normal again. Loss took different forms for all of us, and we all felt it in some form.  And yet, as I think about what makes UCLA great, I&#8217;m reminded that we&#8217;ve gained a lot as well. We have done what Bruins always do &#8211; improvise, adapt and overcome. We&#8217;ve figured out ways to stay in touch, to learn remotely, to better articulate how we are feeling and to define what is important to us and why. We&#8217;ve become closer and more bonded together even as we shelter in place and remain away from campus and each other. In the end, we will not be defined by the pandemic but refined by our response to it. We will meet the obligation to take responsibility for our education with the strength, ingenuity and fearlessness it demands. We remain strong. Steadfast. Resilient. Bruins.

Sure, my four-year class optimization may be on par with that of a professional; timing my snacks down to the minute during a day of stacked classes has taught me a lot about planning. But, just like a person teetering on the cusp between young adulthood and official adulthood, I still resist wearing my retainer consistently and mac 'n' cheese boxes never fail to draw me in at the store.  However, college has taught me different kinds of lessons. Though I will not remember important takeaways from my major, I have gleaned endless takeaways from life in Daily Bruin  namely, what it was like to feel a sense of homeyness.  The Quad was a relatively separated section of the paper my first two years as a contributor. I didnt really find a reason to come to the office unless we had a meeting; it didnt make me feel comfortable  in fact, quite the opposite. Production was a mystery to me  I submitted some words and off they went into some unknown stratosphere.  When I randomly applied for assistant editor at the end of my sophomore year, I didnt even understand the office culture enough to realize that, no, I didnt need to call upper management and Andrew Mr. and Ms. in my cover letter, forgetting for a moment they were also students and not executives at a Fortune 500 company.  I guess Im glad I mentally prepared myself to think the job was as serious as I conjured it up to be, because in a way, it was to me. I was excited to learn and excessively committed to the section. It makes me cringe to think back on the amount of time I spent checking and rechecking Slack and Trello to tick boxes upon boxes of production to-dos, even when everything was done. In the same vein, before becoming the Blogging editor this year, Im embarrassed to admit that I wrote up multiple lists with goals for the section even before I got the job.  When I received the notification this spring that we shouldnt go to the office because of COVID-19, my heart plummeted to my feet. I waited for much of the campus to clear and went to sit in the empty office, alone.  Selfishly, the act was less of a desire and more of a necessity. I grasped helplessly at ways to feel like the editorship I held for half my college career was worth it. I struggled with closure without a graduation, a -30- celebration and senior pictures outside Kerckhoff Hall. Vainly, I felt very angry that the empty office I stood in then was devoid of people I loved and not able to give me the ending I felt I deserved.  Thankfully, I hold snapshots of certain moments in that office that I wont forget  insignificant moments like printing wall quotes, eating stale Rubios chips left out for way too long and lounging horizontally on the (questionably clean?) couches for hours. Im lucky in that I can think of many moments that bring a slight smile to my face rather than be wholly upset at the way the class of 2020s last year was upended.  I spent excessively long hours there, I cried there. I started and ended new relationships there, enduring heartbreak beyond the kind you feel when you see a typo that warrants a correction. I even threw up in one of the office trash cans once (dont ask). Most of all, I loved there, something that wouldve truly shocked my underclassman self.  I know the shoutouts are cheesy, but I cant help it. Andrew, thank you for teaching me everything (I mean everything) that I know, and being an effortlessly great friend to boot. Olivia, thanks for being my right-hand (wo)man and seeing projects through with me  Im constantly in awe of your talent. Amanda and Cecile, you both are legends and I cant wait to see The Quad thrive. Yao and Aneesh, if youre reading this, having you guys by my side as an underclassman meant more than you know. Kristin, Eli and Anushka, Im so glad you guys were some of my first friends as an editor. Ill never forget the times we Postmated food to each others' homes from across the country on more than one occasion, or the time I almost poisoned you all with the unknown alcohol in my flask at last years -29-.  I couldnt tell you any takeaways from Statistics 10, but I learned what a CP option is and some of the weirder rules of AP style. Most importantly, I learned what it was like to flourish as a writer, editor, co-worker and friend.  I think that constitutes a pretty successful college ride.

In 2016, I applied to UCLA as one of the top 10 students in my class, and it said no. My high school band director said I didn&#8217;t have a chance of getting into UCLA, and for a little while, he was right.   One month later, I appealed the decision. One month after that, admissions emailed me. It took two hours to muster enough courage to open the email, and when I did, my life would be ruled by a new, beautiful reality: I was going to be a Bruin.  And now, here I am, four years later, living in a reality as unfathomable now as it was for a then-17-year-old me: remotely graduating from UCLA as an English and political science double major student amid a global pandemic, the first person in my family to graduate from college.  My first year, I was an astrophysics student, partly because I had always been interested in science, and, as I later would discover, partly because I wanted to feel smart enough to be a Bruin, having not earned my spot the first time around.  Later that year, I rediscovered my love for writing and finally changed my major to English, embracing a truth about myself that had long been suppressed by an education system that had downplayed the arts and humanities and treated STEM as the only sensible option.  And then I joined the Daily Bruin.  Some of you Daily Bruin staffers might be asking yourselves who I am &#8211; after all, I haven&#8217;t been an incredibly active contributor, and I rarely had time to spend as much time as I would have liked in the office.  Working for a world-renowned undergraduate newspaper prompted deep introspection about what it means to fight for something you believe in. I have looked on in quiet admiration of so many editors, opinion writers and editors in chief as they have guided the Daily Bruin toward being a respected fixture of UCLA.  The impression the Daily Bruin made on me, even as someone who was less visible than other staffers, was profoundly formative and invaluable. Speak up and fight, especially when it&#8217;s difficult to do so and when pushback is inevitable.  Among so many things, attending UCLA and writing for the Daily Bruin has taught me there is always one more fight to fight, always one more voice to hear and always one more story to tell.  I don&#8217;t think I really knew who I was before UCLA. College has a funny way of flipping the mirror back on yourself and making you look at who you are for all your strengths and flaws.  Four years ago, I shut myself in my car in my high school parking lot, wondering whether the person I saw in my mirror would ever become someone I could love and admire.  Although my journey is by no means complete, today I smile in mirrors more often than I avert my eyes.  Happiness and self-love can often feel like ever-receding horizons, maybe because we put too much emphasis on who we want to be someday and not enough emphasis on who we are now.  But it&#8217;s the little daily victories that get you closer to those horizons: a professor telling you he admires your work, sharing a brief smile with a classmate, accidentally catching a sunset at the top of Janss Steps, getting stuck outside in the rain and laughing at your luck, even getting out of bed when it feels like the whole world is sitting on your chest.  COVID-19, as I have previously  written , has obliterated so much and left seniors and nonseniors reeling backward with so little; it&#8217;s hard to not feel like mental health is in retrograde. But I do think we can all take solace in small daily victories and strive for the big ones, regardless of circumstance.  It feels a little bit selfish to write a column about myself right now, perhaps because #blacklivesmatter is trending, because major American cities are in flames, because George Floyd should still be alive, because a national COVID-19 death toll of more than 100,000 is far too high and because the sitting president openly called for protestors to be shot in the street.  But maybe now is also the perfect time to write a column. Especially amid crisis, we can all learn from journalists, whose responsibility it is to strive for the lofty principles that guide our writing.  Uphold integrity. Require accountability. Share stories. Elevate voices. Never settle. Fight for justice. Fight for truth.   Vito Emanuel was a News contributor 2018-2019 and reporter 2019-2020.

Council meetings take place every Tuesday at 7 p.m. and are open to all students. Spring quarter meetings will take place virtually on Zoom; links for the meetings can be found on the internal vice president&#8217;s Facebook  page . Watch a livestream of the meetings on the  USAC Live! channel  on YouTube.    Public Comment:    Skyler Wolpert, a fourth-year communication student, said she started a petition to revert the Latin honors grade point average requirement to the previous year&#8217;s requirement. Wolpert added that reducing the Latin honors GPA requirement would help students affected by the new coronavirus outbreak.      Special Presentations:    Afrikan Student Union chairperson Alexandria Davis said there have been accounts of black students being  harassed  on Zoom lectures. Davis, a fourth-year African American studies and political science student, said nonstudents have interrupted Chemistry 20L, Astrology 3 and Chicana and Chicano Studies 143 lectures. UCLA spokesperson Zoya Chhabra said incidents of bias can be  reported  online.     Dean of Students Maria Blandizzi said UCLA has approved a six-step plan to address the racial bias incidents.     UCLA has contacted the professor of and a student from the Chicana and Chicano Studies 143 class. UCLA is planning to connect with students from the other two classes that were affected. UCLA has verified that the disruptors are not UCLA students.    Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Jerry Kang and UCLA Information Technology Services are working to prevent future incidents of bias while Vice Chancellor for Strategic Communications Mary Osako is monitoring this issue at other universities. UCLA has provided privacy  guidance  to faculty and is planning to send supplemental bias guidance to faculty.     Election board chair Navi Sidhu said his office is consulting with the USA Judicial Board about election procedures, including the two-week extension for online campaigning. Sidhu said  he does not think that Zoom is an effective platform for the meet the candidates election event. Sidhu also added that he wants to hold giveaways for about 5,000 prizes of $5 gift cards for undergraduate students who vote.    UCLA student government services manager Jessica Alexander said UCLA student Zoom accounts have been upgraded to Zoom Pro accounts.     On-Campus Housing Council representative Arsh Gupta said Hill government will not be continuing operations during spring quarter.     UCLA Residential Life Assistant Director Joshua O&#8217;Connor said the Hill, including dining facilities, will remain open through spring quarter.      Agenda:    The council allocated a total of $2,000 from the Student Wellness Commission Programming Fund to three non-USAC groups.    The council appointed David Minasyan, a third-year economics and psychobiology student, as Finance Committee chair.     Reports:    Internal Vice President Kimberly Bonifacio said her office is planning to use its surplus fund to create a grant for students.

When it comes to protesters fighting for an end to police brutality, however, the LAPD is all too comfortable dropping this mission entirely.   In a perfect example of situational irony, the LAPD  detained  dozens of people protesting racial injustice at Jackie Robinson Stadium on June 1. Jackie Robinson, of course, broke Major League Baseball&#8217;s color barrier and became a prominent civil rights leader after his playing days ended.  LAPD didn&#8217;t just detain these protesters &#8211; the officers treated them with malice.    Testimonies  from detainees described protesters sitting in cages on buses for hours with no food or water. When released, these people had little idea of where they were and, because of dead phones and a lack of  outlets, had no way to call a friend or an Uber.  In a time of great upheaval in our country, when millions of Americans refuse to accept the status quo any longer  , the police have a duty to work with the public to   figure out solutions to issues of systemic racism. And LAPD's checkered past when it comes to events like the savage beating of Rodney King makes it even more imperative that the department acts in good conscience. But when they can&#8217;t do that, it&#8217;s time for universities and cities alike to consider more radical courses of action, like severing ties with racist law enforcement agencies and defunding police squads.     After the incident at Jackie Robinson Stadium came to light, a group of faculty members voiced their dismay at UCLA&#8217;s collaboration with the LAPD. These faculty members, who operate under the organization name The Executive Committee of Concerned UCLA Faculty, called for the administration to cut ties with the LAPD.     Professor Ananya Roy, a member of the committee, pointed out that ending the collaboration between schools and police is a measured response, and other colleges are already doing it. Specifically, Roy mentioned the University of Minnesota and its commitment to  ending  its relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department following former MPD police officer Derek Chauvin's killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man.  &#8220;The fact that the president (of the University of Minnesota) took immediate action shows that other universities can do so as well,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;So that is a first step.&#8221;  Petitions calling for similar ends to police relationships at universities such as New York University, Georgetown University and even UCLA have  gained  signatures, while Clark University in Massachusetts  ended  its relationship with Worcester Police on June 3.  This is a great start. But to solve racial injustices in America,   more universal reforms must be made.     And not only do they have to be universal, but they must also hit the police in a critical spot &#8211; the budget.  Juliet Kucirek, a second-year gender studies student, attended several protests in the past week and said the prevailing sentiment is that the police force needs to be defunded rather than reformed.   &#8220;The police department was designed to protect and serve white people&#8217;s property,&#8221; Kucirek said. &#8220;It&#8217;s working exactly as it was intended.&#8221;  Defunding the police has become a national issue in recent weeks, and a number of politicians have already made commitments to reallocate funds to community services. However,  the exact amount of money varies from city to city.  Los Angeles Mayor  Eric Garcetti  and New York City Mayor  Bill de Blasio  have already made promises to cut the budgets of their cities&#8217; police departments. Garcetti in particular has committed to taking $100 million to $150 million off the LAPD budget, though compared to the department's almost $2 billion budget, $150 million is barely a drop in the bucket.  Not all politicians agree with defunding the police, of course. Both President Donald Trump and presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden came out  against  the idea this past week. Some local politicians, such as LA Councilmember Paul Koretz, are trying to avoid taking a definitive side altogether.  ""I agree that it was absolutely insensitive and insulting to bring the protestors to the Jackie Robinson stadium to be processed for arrest, as he was a hero whose legacy represents standing up against systemic racism and breaking color barriers,"" Koretz said in an emailed statement.  Koretz went on to say an investigation into the event is still pending, and he is waiting for the conclusion of the investigation.    It's not surprising that Koretz is tiptoeing around the issue.   Koretz  has allied himself repeatedly with the police in the past. The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the city&#8217;s police labor union,  donated  to each of Koretz&#8217;s successful bids for LA City Council in City District 5.    Koretz&#8217;s relationship with a police union is sadly not unique. Many local and state politicians are backed by law enforcement agencies and unions that exercise a lot of influence.   But it&#8217;s hard to justify a relationship with these agencies when they&#8217;ve proven to be volatile to the point of violence in recent days.  It&#8217;s easy to say that cutting ties with police agencies and taking money away from law enforcement are radical moves &#8211; especially since, when acting appropriately, a well-trained and well-funded police force can mean the difference between life and death for members of the public.   But the LAPD is not a trusted organization for many individuals.  &#8220;There&#8217;s been continued increase in use of force by LAPD,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;So not surprisingly the communities in which I work think of LAPD as the city&#8217;s largest gang.&#8221;    Instead of ignoring the injustices committed by LAPD or hoping that community service efforts will fix things, it's time for the city to make a more radical choice.  Otherwise, the police will continue to prioritize order over freedom and property rights over human rights.

On a break from her normal frontwoman position in the band Paramore, Hayley Williams is once again utilizing emotional lyrics as a vehicle for self-healing. Her debut solo record, &#8220;Petals for Armor,&#8221; has slowly begun to reveal itself with each raw and honest track, showing that the singer spares no emotion although she&#8217;s broken from the typical &#8220;emo&#8221; label she&#8217;s flaunted since her band&#8217;s first album in 2005.  Williams pulls away from the confines of the widely known group and seems to let her smoother and more stripped-back sound run its course on her new LP. To give listeners a hint at what they&#8217;re in for on the full record, the singer released a set of 5 of its songs titled &#8220;Petals for Armor I.&#8221; Its tracks drift between her struggles with the mortality of herself and others around her and also the experience of living alone.  Small details &#8211; like the singer&#8217;s shoutout to her own dog in &#8220;Cinnamon&#8221; &#8211; ensure that listeners will have the ultimate personal look into Williams&#8217; life with &#8220;Petals for Armor&#8221; as she invites them into her own home. And with its silky smooth production revealed in the recently released tracks, Williams will likely impress fans and new audiences alike with her sure-to-be-intimate lyrical journey on the record when it drops May 8.     -Brooke Cuzick      [Related:    Music Preview: Upcoming albums draw inspiration from personal experiences and global issues   ]     [caption caption=""(Courtesy of Fueled by Ramen)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_377817"" width=""500""] [/caption]       &#8220;Wake Up, Sunshine&#8221; by All Time Low      The &#8220;Last Young Renegade&#8221; era of 2017 came to an end when All Time Low teased its upcoming album through a series of cryptic videos in January.   &#8220;Wake Up, Sunshine&#8221; will not only kick off a new era for the Baltimore pop punk band but also mark its return to a theme of unity when it releases April 3. After a musical hiatus, vocalist Alex Gaskarth  said  the group had strayed from creating a record that included all four members&#8217; collaboration, like their earliest albums starting in 2003. The band returned to writing the album collectively instead of separately as in ones prior, he said, allowing every member to, once again, integrate their own musical roles and emotions throughout.  The band&#8217;s upcoming eighth studio album will boast 15 tracks, two of which already dropped earlier this year: &#8220;Sleeping In&#8221; and &#8220;Some Kind Of Disaster.&#8221; In each of the songs, Gaskarth&#8217;s still clear and vibrant lyrics are reminiscent of his early years in the band, the upbeat instrumentals providing a sense of rejuvenation.   With the band under one roof again, &#8220;Wake Up, Sunshine&#8221; looks to be a classic All Time Low album. The Band CAMINO and blackbear each feature on a track, making the new LP likely to offer some fresh new tunes for what may be the band&#8217;s all time high.   -Drake Gardner    [caption caption=""(Courtesy of Columbia Records)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_377818"" width=""500""] [/caption]     &#8220;Gaslighter&#8221; by Dixie Chicks   Time has done nothing to dull the bold political discourse of the Dixie Chicks.  The country trio is back on the music scene for the first time in 14 years to bring &#8220;Gaslighter&#8221; to its waiting listeners. The album welcomes the Dixie Chicks back from its hiatus, following years of backlash the band faced after speaking out against President George W. Bush&#8217;s stance on the Iraq War. But with the album&#8217;s titular leading single, it is clear that nothing can stop the singers from telling listeners how they feel about the world&#8217;s hot button social and political issues.  The band&#8217;s classic three-vocal harmony opens the track with a modern take on its country twang. While condemning the act of gaslighting to get further in life, the song&#8217;s evolved country-pop fusion reveals the influence from artists such as Taylor Swift, who lended the trio a feature on her latest album.  Working with producer Jack Antonoff &#8211; who also helped produce Swift&#8217;s &#8220;Lover&#8221; &#8211; Dixie Chicks will likely solidify a contemporary take on country throughout the record once it hits radio waves May 1. And lead singer Natalie Maines goes into the release undaunted, as she opens &#8220;Gaslighter&#8221; by calling out the past actions of her ex-husband with a sound rooted in the present. It makes the upcoming record likely to follow in the footsteps of artists such as Kacey Musgraves &#8211; bringing the world of country rustic to polished radio pop.     -Brooke Cuzick     [Related:    Music Preview: Artists embody purpose by defining individual identities   ]       [caption caption=""(Courtesy of Capitol Records UK)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_377819"" width=""500""] [/caption]       &#8220;To Die For&#8221; by Sam Smith   Fans will be dying to listen to Sam Smith&#8217;s upcoming album &#8211; the first since 2017.   ""To Die For,"" the singer&#8217;s third R&amp;B pop soul studio record and follow-up to &#8220;The Thrill of It All,&#8221; will feature 14 new tracks when it releases June 5. The new record has been teased at through the staggered release of each of Smith&#8217;s five singles &#8211; from &#8220;Fire on Fire,&#8221; which dropped in 2018, to the 2020 unveiling of its titular track.  As in past songs, the singer&#8217;s notions of romantic love have been expressed in the album&#8217;s already released singles, such as &#8220;How Do You Sleep?&#8221; Smith  tweeted  they are more proud of the upcoming album than any of their previous work as they felt liberated while songwriting. Smith said they hope fans can genuinely relate to the songs&#8217; stories.  While Smith said their music has always been for the fans, it appears &#8220;To Die For&#8221; will be an ultimate love letter to them &#8211; and hopefully will result in an album listeners keep close to them for years to come.   -Drake Gardner    [caption caption=""(Courtesy of Epiphany Music)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_377820"" width=""500""] [/caption]     &#8220;Such Pretty Forks in the Road&#8221; by   Alanis Morissette     Alanis Morissette will welcome listeners into the most personal parts of her life for the first time in 12 years.  The &#8220;Jagged Little Pill&#8221; singer is set to release her upcoming record &#8220;Such Pretty Forks in the Road&#8221; this May, just shy of the 25-year anniversary of her 1995 debut album. Between opening a Broadway production and launching a summer North American tour to celebrate the record&#8217;s silver anniversary, Morisette has added a full-length album to her musical agenda.  Composed of 11 tracks, &#8220;Such Pretty Forks in the Road&#8221; has already been prefaced by its two leading singles, &#8220;Smiling&#8221; and &#8220;Reasons I Drink.&#8221; In an  interview with This Morning,  Morissette said the new record has allowed her to express emotions she didn&#8217;t previously want to acknowledge. The end result was a cathartic release of her feelings throughout her three pregnancies, as well as how she felt postpartum, she said.  In the singles released so far, Morissette&#8217;s same 1990s grunge and rock-inspired vocals shine. She peels back the walls to reveal her emotions as she tackles themes of addiction and deep sadness to the tune of whirring electric guitars.  The singer definitely held an outspoken place in the hearts of '90s rockers, but with such heavy marketing placed on her first claim to fame, it will likely be difficult for her to create an album which stands on its own.     -Brooke Cuzick  ",[],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/springmusic3.png

The alumna said her podcast was inspired by traveling around the world meeting different types of creatives in the industry,  such as DJs and c  omposers. She said the conversations she recorded at the time led to the inception of her podcast, with the first episode airing four years ago.  ""I'd bring out a recorder and record a half-hour to 45-minute interview with them while I was traveling,"" Johnson said. ""It let people have a space to talk about change, and really talk about innovation &#8211; but everyone has a different lens.""   [Related:    Podcast &#8216;Elderllama&#8217; breaks down the universe with casual conversation   ]      Since then, the podcast has featured more than 70 guests, Johnson said, including musical industry talents such as composer Siddhartha Khosla and co-founder and CEO of Bandsintown Fabrice Sergent. She said her guests share how they stylistically innovate their own work and their plans to improve the industry through new business strategies, musical compositions and artificial intelligence technologies.  Each podcast provides a different perspective from each guest that speaks to how they are changing the music industry through technological and social change, Johnson said. These &#8220;innovators,&#8221; as the podcast&#8217;s title alludes to, have worked in a variety of mediums, which was key to their success, Johnson said. The mediums vary from public policy and sound diplomacy to technologies that help support artists virtually, and Johnson said her guests often are working to connect the dots between these fields.  &#8220;In many ways, it's their journey,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;The way they innovate and what they do for their current adventure now has to do with the experiences they've had.&#8221;  One of the previous guests of the show, composer Ed Goldfarb, is most well-known for his musical work on the animated series, ""Pokemon."" Goldfarb said he has been composing the musical score for ""Pokemon"" since 2014 and shared his musical evolution, detailing his journey from playing piano as a child to composing music in his studio as an adult. With shows like ""Pokemon"" garnering a  global audience, Goldfarb said the podcast provides an avenue to share how his work has brought people together.  However, to continue to help the podcast's audience through marketing,   fourth-year communication student Alex Dolven produces the graphic designs for the podcast. He said he oversees the back end of things, such as hosting the guests and working on web design, live sound and studio engineering. Dolven said he thinks the podcast is valuable for college students interested in what the industry entails.   &#8220;We want to include more of a community, including kind of people who are outside the insider business portion who want to make those connections and know what's out there,&#8221; Dolven said. ""Those are the communities we're trying to bring into the fold.&#8221;   [Related:    Podcast decodes ethics in artificial intelligence and its relevance to public   ]    In its recent episodes, the podcast has come out with content focused on music technology, blockchain and artificial intelligence.

Johnson said she recently researched social changes in music provoked by the pandemic for the Amplify Music: Resilience and Community Ecosystems, an event co-hosted virtually by the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. In the future, Johnson said she hopes to continue working in both avenues, the ""Innovating Music"" podcast and the Amplify Music conferences, which for her represents the link between technological change and social change within the music industry.   &#8220;A lot of it is a combination of sort of technology and transformation in art,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;There are all these new things happening in the social construction around music, the human stuff.

Journalists are supposed to hold individuals in positions of power accountable for their actions and provide a platform to give a voice to the voiceless, the overlooked and the betrayed. I think it is easy to think that someone who does so much for the community is ultimately a hero &#8211; and that was something I so desperately wanted to be.  I recall a field trip I took freshman year with other first-year staffers to the Los Angeles Times office. Their staff takes pride in the fact that despite dynamite blasting their building in response to their publisher&#8217;s staunch anti-union position, they still managed to produce a paper. Long before The Bruin&#8217;s strike last year, I had considered what I would do if the staff decided to strike. It was easy to take the position that the paper should continue to be published at all costs.  It was a much more difficult position to take in real life.  Someone asked me shortly after I took over as editor in chief in spring 2018 whether I had ever been a Boy Scout. I thought it was a funny question because no, I had not been one as a child, and I did not necessarily think I had a firm set of codes I lived by. But it did help me to understand that much of my life I have been dealing with being a protagonist. I want to be the hero. Journalism seemed the perfect outlet for self-sacrifice, to be a leader who makes time for his staff or a journalist who sacrifices his own beliefs and identity to show the world an unfiltered and objective perspective.  I buried myself in my work and relied on my stature and accomplishments for my own perception of self-worth. All this came crumbling down when it became clear the staff was split on whether to strike over the UCLA Communications Board&#8217;s decision to go against the staff&#8217;s endorsement for my successor. I always knew that I would stand on the side of publishing, and once I decide on something, not much can be done to change my mind.  There&#8217;s no denying that lines were drawn, and I still struggle to feel welcome in Kerckhoff 118. And that is a shame because many of my greatest memories from college come from that place. I remember working tirelessly with my fellow 2017-2018 News editors, Rupan, Hedy, Emi, Sharon and Anny, to make deadline &#8211; maybe once a month if we were lucky. And I still find myself trying to wrap my head around the metaphors Keshav, the 2017-2019 Opinion editor, would make during editorial board meetings.  For a long time, I blamed the strike for my changed feelings about The Bruin. But it was editorship that had changed me. There&#8217;s no denying that The Bruin&#8217;s culture mimics that of any workplace, with some individuals carrying more popularity than others. I have never in my life been popular, and it wasn&#8217;t important to me. I viewed The Bruin as my job, and I cared deeply about doing it well.  My predecessors have frequently used this platform as a space to talk about the successes of The Bruin and the future they are excited to see for it. They seldom speak about the uncomfortable moments when you have to make difficult decisions &#8211; and for good reason. Nobody quite understands what it is like to sit in the editor-in-chief chair until they have sat in it. I let this job consume me and some of the things that happened still weigh on me heavily. I suppose in some sense, I got to live my dream of being the hero. In another sense, The Bruin feels empty to me now.  There&#8217;s this idea always spinning around in my protagonist head, that it all meant something. That not missing a single day of daily newspaper production spoke volumes about my ability to preserve our history in the face of adversity. I think we all want the pieces to fit together cleanly so that when we step back, the image is something that instills confidence and pride. I would have loved to be remembered as a great leader and someone who people can, many years from now, come to for advice or anything else they might need.  I spent many weeks when my time as editor in chief expired venturing to Kerckhoff Coffeehouse with Raunak, the 2018-2019 Arts editor, who has easily become my best friend after all of this. Most days, we would just reminisce about the strike and ponder what The Bruin must be like without us.  The days as a student journalist have blended together into this one traumatic and inspiring memory. I went to work at Kerckhoff 118. I made some friends and I wrote some cool stories. I got my name printed in a strike letter, and I had to assure our small nonstriking team that we would indeed be publishing a paper the next morning. That alone might have been the most heroic moment in my life.  I came into The Bruin hoping to become a journalist and a hero. I left The Bruin ultimately neither of those things. It would have been nice to be remembered for all of my accomplishments and for helping our talented team tell the stories our readers deserved.  I picked the battles I felt were worth fighting. I told the stories I thought were worth telling. And I leave it to our readers to decide if what we did was right and important &#8211; as they should with all journalism.

With the 94th pick of the 2020 MLB Draft, the Washington Nationals selected UCLA baseballs junior right-handed pitcher Holden Powell. He is the second Bruin to be picked this year, after junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell was drafted at No. 20 overall by the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday.    While he didnt amass the innings that he did in his first two seasons, Powells stats improved from 2019 to 2020, just as they did from 2018 to 2019. In his freshman year, the righty tossed 33.1 innings and pitched to the tune of a 3.51 ERA and a 1.08 WHIP. His 22 strikeouts gave him a K/9 of 5.9.&nbsp;    He followed that up with a 1.84 ERA and 0.94 WHIP in 49.0 innings his sophomore year, striking out 65 hitters en route to an 11.9 K/9. In the shortened 2020 season, the Bruins closer had yet to allow an earned run in 9.1 innings of work and had punched out 20 opposing hitters  good for a 19.3 K/9.    Overall, Powell pitched over 90 innings in the blue and gold, while picking up 107 strikeouts along the way. In his three seasons, the 20-year-old from Visalia, California,   had a 2.26 ERA and a 0.95 WHIP.    While Powell and Mitchell were drafted to the two teams that faced off against each other in the National League Wild Card game, it was Powells Nationals who ultimately lifted the Commissioners Trophy at the end of the 2019 season.    Despite winning the World Series title, the Nationals bullpen was one of the worst in terms of ERA in the MLB last season. Only the Baltimore Orioles bullpen had a higher ERA than the 5.68 mark set by Washingtons relievers. Powell will join a strengthened Nationals relief corps headlined by right-handers Daniel Hudson, Will Harris and Tanner Rainey and left-hander Sean Doolittle.    As of the draft, the MLB and the MLB Players Association have yet to strike a deal that would bring professional baseball back in 2020. If and when an agreement is reached, it is unlikely that a Minor League Baseball season will happen, and, as a result, the only pro ball Powell would see this year would be if he got called up to the big league team  presumably as it gears up for a playoff push.

In &#8220;A Parks and Recreation Special,&#8221; the cast of the NBC sitcom, which ran from 2009 to 2015, participated in a new scripted episode to raise money for  Feeding America's COVID-19 Response Fund . The episode follows Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler)   checking   in on her friends through a scheduled   ""phone tree"" of required calls as she and her husband Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) participate in a Pawnee media tour regarding COVID-19.   [Related:    &#8216;Killing Eve&#8217; season 3 recap &#8211; episode 3: &#8216;Meetings Have Biscuits&#8217;   ]   Opening with a scruffy looking Bobby Newport (Paul Rudd) discovering there's a global pandemic and telling viewers to donate, the special quickly settles into a rhythm of Zoom-esque calls. As characters call each other &#8211; and try to avoid being the one to call Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir) &#8211; they discuss how they&#8217;ve been handling social distancing and their own mental health.  Of course,   seeing the cast filming from home after seven seasons of professional lighting and makeup inherently sets &#8220;A Parks and Recreation Special&#8221;   apart from previous episodes, and looking at everyone straight on lacks the nuance of a staged episode. But the episode leans into this, grounding jokes in   virtual tropical backgrounds and Jerry&#8217;s inability to turn off filters.  Some explanations for the technical obstacle of separated spouses seem a bit forced, like Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) being stuck in a shed. When Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) and Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), however, discuss being quarantined separately as Ann volunteers as a nurse, it reflects   the heartfelt nature of the episode. Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) and his ex-wife Tammy Two (Megan Mullally), on the other hand, appear together in a characteristically twisted interaction, with the two actors building on their real-life marriage as Tammy sneaks into Ron's workshop.  Inevitably, however, the episode is one of fan service. It would be difficult to reunite a beloved show without calling back to the most iconic moments, and the network has to fill time without much of a plot to fit in almost the entire cast. &#8220;Ya Heard? With Perd&#8221; revives the bumbling newscaster, and &#8220;Pawnee Today&#8221; gives a glimpse into Joan Callamezzo&#8217;s (Mo Collins) particular brand of chaos amped up as a result of social isolation.  Without distinct plot points, the special calls back to classic ""Parks and Recreation"" motifs. Ben is seen dipping back into both claymation and &#8220;Cones of Dunshire&#8221; &#8211;  two products of his past mental spirals &#8211;  as he works on a script combining the two. Later, Andy appears as Johnny Karate to remind kids to wash their hands while an on-screen reminder informs viewers that the coronavirus cannot, in fact, be karate-chopped away.   [Related:    Second Take: Online live performances proliferate, revitalize highly restrictive music industry     ]   The actors fall back into their roles effortlessly, with Lowe channeling Chris&#8217; upbeat attitude toward his body apparently being as healthy as both Megan Rapinoe&#8217;s and a panther&#8217;s. Aubrey Plaza, on the other hand, suddenly shoves the camera towards her open mouth in a distinctly April Ludgate moment. Without the help of a set or in-person cast chemistry and having to serve as their own tech crew, it's commendable that each actor was also able to dust off old characters' personalities.  The episode culminates with &#8220;5,000 Candles in the Wind,&#8221; which popped up throughout the seven seasons' more sentimental moments. As the cast sings along, Ben continues to be perplexed by the mini horse&#8217;s popularity, and Ron sings in near-tears. Seeing the cast together one last time, despite the unfortunate circumstances, still creates a warm, touching moment.  Though most side characters aren&#8217;t given much screen time, glimpses into their lives provide a welcome path back into the show. It&#8217;s uplifting to know that   &#8211;   even as the world changes &#8211;   Jerry is still bumbling, April's still surly and Donna Meagle (Retta) is still treating herself, all while Leslie continues to help others. For fans wishing to slip into familiar relationships and jests, the special offers an excellent escape.  And with  many feeling dissatisfied                    with the real-life government, it&#8217;s comforting to fall back into the &#8220;Parks and Recreation&#8221; world, in which public servants actively work to better their community. Admittedly, the content can verge on cheesy at times, with urges to consider one&#8217;s mental health ending up heavy-handed. But in the end, when Leslie&#8217;s friends clear their schedules just to cheer her up,   their reunion is a joyful suggestion to lean on one's friends.  &#8220;Parks and Recreation&#8221; was always about friends, waffles and work. With limited access to friends, work transferred to home and sit-down restaurants closed, the special offers a cozy escape   &#8211; and a reminder that it doesn&#8217;t hurt to treat yourself every so often.

There is concern for the transition to the new federal sexual misconduct regulations because students may be deterred from coming forward, said UC systemwide Title IX director Suzanne Taylor.  United States Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced changes to Title IX rules for colleges that receive federal funding May 6. Title IX is a federal law protecting people from sexual discrimination in federally funded programs.   [Related link:    New Title IX rules aim to strengthen due process for students accused of sexual misconduct   ]   The new Title IX regulations will require universities to use a narrower definition of sexual harassment, once the changes take effect Aug. 14. The changes will also increase legal protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.  The new Title IX definition of sexual harassment will require students who are reporting their cases to prove that the harassment was so severe that it denied equal access to education. The Title IX changes will also require colleges to hold live hearings and allow both parties to participate in a formal questioning process.  The UC will continue responding to sexual misconduct reports that do not meet the new Title IX definition, Taylor said.  Were still going to respond just as vigorously, but it makes it more complicated because we have to figure out an alternative process for resolving (sexual misconduct cases), she said.  However, the University is concerned that the new Title IX regulations will deter students from reporting sexual misconduct and going through the Title IX legal process, Taylor added.   Deterring Reports   Anything that is going to make it harder to report (sexual misconduct) is going to silence the victim, said Quentin Lee, a UCLA alumnus who accused a former UCLA doctor of sexual misconduct.  Survivors may be emotionally triggered when reporting and listening about other sexual assault cases, said gender studies professor Rachel Lee. Universities should recognize that reporting cases can be harmful and triggering for survivors, she added.  Sometimes, going through these official processes retraumatizes victims and accusers, and doesnt serve anyone, Rachel Lee said. Any disclosure becomes reported and has to go to an official route, ... when sometimes a victim of sexual trauma wants an unofficial avenue and just compassion.  The UCLA Campus Assault Resources and Education Office provides confidential support to students and remains open to those who do not wish to go through the Title IX legal process.  ""(It is) important to me to tell (my) story without having to deal with all this legal stuff,"" Quentin Lee said. ""I just want my story to be told, to be heard.""  The DOE said in a  May 6 press release  that the new Title IX regulations will strengthen protections for survivors of sexual misconduct and restore due process for accused students. However, UCLA officials and student leaders have  criticized the changes , which they say will hurt survivors of sexual misconduct.  ""I did not want to go through (the) university because I know it's got to go through all this red tape, so I know the system is not gonna work for me,"" Quentin Lee said.  Rachel Lee said she thinks the formal Title IX process is not typically the best way to support survivors of sexual violence.  The litigation and punitive route, with regard to sexual violence, has never been the approach that we have endorsed as the one that should take primacy on our campus, Rachel Lee said.  Under the new Title IX rules, individuals accused of sexual misconduct are now assumed to be innocent until proven guilty. Previously, officials used the standard of preponderance of evidence, which uses the most convincing evidence of either party to assess claims of sexual misconduct.  This standard was in effect during President Barack Obamas administration, which introduced increased protections for accusers. The rate of sexual misconduct reports at UCLA rose several years after Obama published recommended policies in 2011 for schools to address sexual harassment.  There were 26 reported cases of sexual assault on campus at UCLA in 2014 and 57 in 2018, according to a  UCLA Annual Security &amp; Fire Safety Repor  t . Between 2018 to 2019, there was an increase of about 11% in prohibited conduct reports, according to the  2020 UCLA Public Accountability Report . UCLA-specific data prior to 2014 was not available at the time of publication.       However, about 23% of sexual assaults are reported to police, according to the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network. The rise in reports during the Obama administration does not necessarily mean that the actual number of sexual assaults rose, according to the organization.  Since the new Title IX rules have not yet taken effect, it is not fully clear how they will affect reporting rates for sexual assault, said Scott Scheffler, the UCPD community services division lieutenant.   Changing policies   In response to the new Title IX regulations, UCLA offices plan to both maintain ongoing plans and increase resources for students reporting sexual misconduct.  CARE intends to continue providing its services independent of Title IX reporting and legal processes, said Jennifer Jiries, CARE program director, in an emailed statement. The UCLA Title IX Office will also continue to organize academic and financial accommodations for students, said Mohammed Cato, UCLA Title IX director, in an emailed statement. Cato did not provide additional details regarding these accommodations.  In January, the CARE office added a new confidential advocate position who is available to explain options for students and intends to add more staff to respond to the new changes if funds are available, Jiries said. The UCLA Title IX Office also plans on hiring additional investigators, Cato said.  However, UC President Janet Napolitano said in a May 6  statement  the new Title IX rules were ill-conceived changes that would be difficult to implement before the tight deadline.  The UC must comply with the Title IX changes by the Aug. 14 deadline because its federal funding is contingent on compliance, Taylor said. She added the UC will revise its sexual harassment policies, but she did not offer details about what these revisions would entail.  The new changes also make it more difficult for the DOE itself to enforce Title IX, Taylor said.  Before the new regulations were implemented, the DOE Office for Civil Rights required universities to respond quickly and equitably to sexual harassment reports or an investigation would ensue, Taylor said.  However, these new changes lower the standard for the OCR to investigate a university for violating Title IX policies, Taylor said. A university will now only be investigated if it was found to be deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment notices, she added.   Legal battles   &nbsp;  In spite of the new changes, university officials and advocacy groups are calling for greater protections for victims of sexual misconduct.  Napolitano said DeVos rules were misguided and could deter colleges from responding appropriately to sexual harassment. The DOE is seeking to reverse previous progress on sexual misconduct issues, she added.  The American Civil Liberties Union, a civil rights advocacy group, filed a lawsuit May 14 against the DOE over the new Title IX regulations. The UC expects more legal battles from other states and organizations, Taylor said.  Taylor said the UC would evaluate how to support legal battles from other parties, but she did not mention whether the UC plans to file a lawsuit against the DOE.  Amid the legal battles, the UC plans on revising its Title IX processes to comply with the law but also to not deter students from coming forward with their accusations, Taylor said.  Fair processes dont mean very much if people dont come forward to report sexual harassment, Taylor said. Its really important that we make sure that we not only comply with the law, but (that we also) continue to treat parties with the compassion and the empathy that the situation warrants.

There are two types of instructors at most universities &#8211; and the title matters.   Professors are tenure-track faculty, meaning they have consistent employment and benefits, such as health care. They teach some classes a year, but much of their work supplies the university with research that extends beyond teaching.  Lecturers are hired to teach courses, but with limited job security and inconsistent workloads. They don&#8217;t produce research for the university, and their main obligation is to   teach undergraduate courses. Once these individuals enter a lecturer track, it can be very difficult to transition to a tenure-track position.    At UCLA, professor positions are far more profitable careers &#8211; but lecturers are often the people who provide students with the education necessary to graduate  .   But at a major research institution like UCLA, students often aren&#8217;t aware of the pay discrepancies between professors and lecturers.   And while the university knows this is bad press,   it has a responsibility to   increase awareness about the distinction between lecturers and professors and call attention to the prejudices lecturers face without stigmatizing them.    Many UCLA lecturers have the same credentials as tenure-track faculty, but their compensation doesn't reflect that.  &#8220;(At UCLA), teaching is not the main objective of being a professor &#8211; it's the production of science or research,&#8221; said Wisam Alshaibi, a Ph.D. candidate in the sociology department. &#8220;So, teaching is seen as a second-order thing, especially undergraduate teaching.&#8221;   Not only are lecturers underpaid for their major contributions to the university's mission of education, but they're also underrepresented within their departments.       Professors regularly take part in departmental committees, which make important decisions such as whether to hire a particular candidate. In contrast, lecturers are largely excluded from these committees, despite having a stake in these decisions and, often, more interaction with the student body.  A journal article in  New Directions for Institutional Research  said nontenure-track faculty are not given much opportunity to integrate into departments, as they can be assigned classes last minute.  &#8220;(Lecturers) can be let go for any reason at the end of any (quarter); they're only paid to teach,&#8221; said Trevor Griffey, a lecturer for the UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment.   Many lecturers find it difficult to maintain a full-time course load, as the inconsistency of their contracts means they may teach full-time one quarter and barely part-time the next.  &#8220;(A lecturer is) like a musician looking for gigs,&#8221; Alshaibi said. &#8220;If they have a Ph.D., then they did all of this work to get paid less than an Uber driver would make.&#8221;  Lucrative tenure-track professor positions are being phased out in universities across the country, leaving lecturers with the responsibility of teaching a variety of upper- and lower-division courses.  And UCLA has been more than willing to exploit that desperation.   &#8220;There are far more people with Ph.D.s than there are tenure-track jobs to hire them,&#8221; Alshaibi said. &#8220;There are plenty of teaching positions because universities have more and more resorted to graduate student labor and lecturer labor to teach classes.&#8221;   And with this increased reliance comes a shift in the traditional makeup of the university.   Lecturers were historically intended to be an emergency measure, but since   it was a financially viable way for universities to cut costs, they became increasingly common. According to  The Journal of Higher Education , the number of lecturers with precarious job security has been increasing over the last 40 years or so.  Karl Lisovsky, a lecturer in Writing Programs at UCLA and president of the  University Council-American Federation of Teachers , said lecturers do 30% to 50% of the teaching at the university.   &#8220;We think of ourselves as scholars and don't so much think of ourselves as workers,&#8221; Lisovsky said. &#8220;However, the university does think of us as workers, and the further it slides into the business model of corporate workings, the more it behaves that way.&#8221;  But UCLA is in the unique position of being more than just a business.   Considering the university's reputation, there is an expectation that faculty members are being paid a wage reflective of their positions. But currently, that expectation is not being met.   Lisovsky said the university doesn't want to advocate for lecturers because of the increasingly corporate model of the University of California system.   It's also because having these conversations opens the door to increasing lecturer pay &#8211; and that's a cost the university doesn't want to endure. But at its base, the UC is not a corporate model. It's a public institution, and it has a responsibility to actively inform students of inequalities faced by their lecturers.  &#8220;Students should know about these distinctions because there's so much inequality,&#8221; Alshaibi said. &#8220;(You would) have a problem with having a personal relationship with someone that you know is being exploited.&#8221;  Some are quick to assure lecturers that they&#8217;re lucky to be working for UCLA at all and that they were the ones who chose to take a lecturer position instead of seeking a tenure-track professor position. However, the emphasis on lecturer positions has increased, while fewer tenure-track positions are offered. This assumption trivializes the responsibility the university has to support these faculty members.    Lecturer or not, every UCLA faculty member deserves job security and a living wage.  And higher education should not be treated like a business, in which temporary work is a necessary evil.

But facing their crosstown rivals just a day later, it was the Bruins who put up runs early and kept piling it on late into the game.   After picking up its second loss of the season to TCU in its second game of the Southern California College Baseball Classic, No. 6 UCLA (13-2) scored three runs in the top of the first inning against USC (9-5), going on to defeat the Trojans 15-3 and deny its crosstown rivals an undefeated run over the weekend.  Junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell led off the Bruins with a single to right-center field to get UCLA started for the afternoon. The ensuing batter, freshman right fielder Michael Curialle, reached on an error by Trojan pitcher Alex Cornwell &#8211; the first of two Trojan errors in the opening frame.  Cornwell was able to bounce back, however, putting the next two batters away. But with two outs, the Bruins rallied with back-to-back hits by junior left fielder Pat Caulfield and sophomore third baseman Jake Moberg. After the top half of the opening inning, the Bruins had a three-run lead before a Trojan had entered the batter&#8217;s box.  The three-run lead was slashed to one in the bottom of the inning as sophomore right-hander Jesse Bergin gave up a walk to the leadoff Trojan batter, who was eventually brought home by Trojan catcher/infielder Clay Owens who went deep to dead center to put runs on the board for his home squad.  Bergin bounced back, however, sending the Trojans down in order in the second inning. Bergin would go on to pitch six full innings, allowing just three hits to notch his fourth win in as many starts.  The Bruins scored their fourth run in the third inning on a sacrifice fly from senior designated hitter Kyle Cuellar, and Cornwell was forced to exit two innings later as his pitch count crept up to 100 on the day.   Despite the new arm on the mound in the fifth, Cuellar wasn&#8217;t done on offense just yet. In his next plate appearance, Cuellar drove an inside fastball over the right field wall to bring in two runs on his first home run of the year. The deep ball came immediately after Caulfield laid down a sacrifice bunt to score redshirt freshman first baseman JT Schwartz from third.  After Bergin needed just eight pitches to retire the side in the bottom of the sixth inning, UCLA headed into the seventh with the lead standing at six runs.  The Bruins didn&#8217;t stop piling on the runs in the late innings, as UCLA pushed the lead to 10-2 in the top of the seventh inning off another Trojan error &#8211; one of the five total errors for USC in the game.  The very next batter, sophomore second baseman Mikey Perez, hit another ball down the third base line to score an additional two runs to push the lead to 10 and chase the fourth Trojan pitcher to enter the game.  After Bergin&#8217;s day came to a close, junior right-hander Michael Townsend made his 10th appearance of the season, allowing one run in the bottom of the seventh inning. And after UCLA added an additional two runs the next inning, two more relief pitchers &#8211; senior Kyle Mora and junior Holden Powell &#8211; entered the game to close it out.  Over the nine innings, UCLA tallied team highs in hits and runs to win by its largest margin of the season.  Without a midweek game scheduled, UCLA will take the field again to begin conference play against Oregon at Jackie Robinson Stadium on Friday.

Council meetings take place every Tuesday at 7 p.m. and are open to all students. Spring quarter meetings will take place virtually on Zoom; links for the meetings can be found on the Internal Vice President&#8217;s Facebook page. Watch a livestream of the meetings on the  USAC Live!  channel on YouTube.   Public Comment:    Keya Vijapure, the California Public Interest Research Group campus relations coordinator on the affordable textbooks program and a first-year physiological science student, asked the council to advocate for expanding student access to affordable educational resources.    Sithara Menon said she is no longer the chair of CALPIRG at UCLA. She expressed gratitude toward USAC members for the work they have accomplished this year. Prab Rai, incoming chapter chair of CALPIRG at UCLA, said she is excited to work with the incoming council.    Undergraduate Students Association Elections Board Chair Navi Sidhu said the elections board asked him to remind council members to promote voter turnout, especially considering that last year had about a 16% turnout. The USAC election is underway and will last until Friday.    Agenda:    The Green Initiative Fund adjusted the money allocated to three previous applications of student-initiated projects to a total of $23,125.    The council approved new requirements for maintaining Campus Safety Alliance voting membership. A member must attend three CSA meetings throughout the academic year to keep their voting rights. The alliance will also elect a representative to the Public Safety Advisory Council, a council chaired by Vice Chancellor Michael Beck, at its last meeting of the academic year.    The council approved an amendment to its bylaws to clarify the Facilities commission appoints five undergraduate student representatives to The Green Initiative Fund. The amendment also reflected the Facilities commissioner will serve as chair of TGIF.    USAC and the Transfer Leadership Coalition endorsed a resolution to condemn the Daily Bruin Editorial Board&#8217;s rhetoric in a nonendorsement of a transfer student candidate as disrespectful toward transfer students at UCLA.    Naomi Riley, the Academic Affairs commissioner, raised concerns about certain professors giving out difficult midterms on short time limits. Riley said the council should try to replicate previous success with the Academic Senate to help students going through unfair academic situations    Financial Supports Commissioner Millen Srivastava said UCLA will be distributing part of the money allocated to it under the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act back toward the student population. Each student will receive $200 from the university. The CARES Act requires recipients to be U.S. citizens, but the university will open up university funding to funnel money to undocumented and international students. About $10,000,000 will go toward need-based financial aid for students, which also will not be limited by citizenship.     The council also proposed an opt-out system, where a student has the option to donate the $200 they receive under CARES Act to financial aid funding.    Report    USAC President Robert Watson said the University of California Office of the President has lowered the referendums threshold from 20% to 15%, meaning a referendum now needs to only reach at least 15% voter turnout and win a majority of the vote cast to go into effect. He added the class of 2020 accomplishment task force, which oversees graduation plans for 2020, is operational.    General Representative 2 Orion Smedley said his office is taking three approaches to make the budget clearer for students. He added the report will include a word cloud of all the purchases USAC has made. He also said he hopes to combine machine learning and an administrative approach with the word cloud.    General Representative 3 Brandon Broukhim said his office will be releasing an end-of-the-year report. He added that the last group of Westwood businesses that are collaborating with the council to offer students discounts will be announced tomorrow.    Riley said a housing task force is researching models for housing options for the next academic year.    Campus Events Commissioner Tara Steinmetz said her office is coordinating with local artists to livestream concerts. Steinmetz added her office is also coordinating a Zoom cook-along with Antoni Porowski from Queer Eye on Saturday.    Srivastava said her office has just closed applications for the COVID-19 Relief Fund. She also said student tuition refunds are not viable because of costs incurred by COVID-19-related disruptions.    Student Wellness Commissioner Mihika Sridhar said her office will be coordinating with the Financial Supports commission to assist students in need with financial support.

Gavin Newsom.  Today we become the first state in the nation to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by mailing every registered voter a ballot, said California Secretary of State Alex Padilla in a  statement . We are meeting our obligation to provide an accessible, secure, and safe election this November.  The vote-by-mail system is popular in states that have adopted it, said Sonni Waknin, a recent alumna and legal fellow at the UCLA Voting Rights Project.  It allows people to engage more firmly in the democratic process because they are able to think and contemplate their voting choices, Waknin said. If you're at home with your ballot, you can research the candidates.  Additionally, voters can avoid the hassle of waiting in lines and voting in booths, said Nicolas Riani, a third-year public affairs student and state board chair for California Public Interest Research Group Students.  I think there is actually an opportunity here to continue sending every voter a vote-by-mail ballot, even after this pandemic is over, Riani said. (Vote-by-mail) could reduce lines, which I know was a big problem here at UCLA this year, we had lines of two to four hours for students to vote.  If instruction is to resume in the fall, this system might save students valuable time spent in line and in crowded voting booths, Riani added.   [Related:    Wait times at polling centers at Ackerman Union run more than 4 hours   ]   However, Waknin said the UCLA Voting Rights Project is aware some voters are concerned their ballots might not be counted.  In response, some states and counties have implemented ballot tracking, which allows voters to check the progress of their ballot  online , Waknin said. The UCLA Voting Rights Project has advocated to expand this feature in order to assure voters that their ballot will count, Waknin added.  People may also be concerned about the possibility of voter fraud, as well as the misplacement of ballots, Waknin said.  Waknin said a lot of states use signature matching so that when people vote by mail, election administrators match the signature on their ballot to their signature on file from the Department of Motor Vehicles or from their original voter registration.  Dan Thompson, an incoming assistant political science professor at UCLA, said he believes people should be more concerned with how difficult it will be for some states to transition to vote-by-mail than mail ballot fraud.  In a state like California, it is very common to vote by mail, and so it wouldn't be particularly difficult to ramp things up, Thompson said. But on the other hand, there are states like New Hampshire that don't have all that many people voting by mail, and you could imagine that the ramp up might be more difficult.",['cap-seth-freitas'],"['california', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.news_.CAvotebymail.filephoto.jpg

United Auto Workers Local 2865 claims the UC acted unlawfully in the way UC Santa Cruz suspended and disciplined striking student workers  Friday . The union will also consider calling for a vote to go on a UC-wide strike after meeting with representatives from each UC campus this week, according to the press release.  &#8220;The union&#8217;s elected Bargaining Team will convene this week to discuss our options, and that includes a possible strike authorization vote in response to UC&#8217;s repeated Unfair Labor Practices,&#8221; said UAW Local 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar in the release.  Graduate students at UCSC began striking in December for a cost-of-living adjustment to their wages by refusing to turn in fall quarter grades. In response, UCSC fired 54 student workers Friday and prohibited them from securing spring quarter appointments.  &#8220;UC should sit down and bargain with the union for a COLA rather than terminating and denying future employment to our members who are fighting (for) fair wages for all academic student employees to meet the high cost of housing,&#8221; Iyengar said in the statement.  UAW Local 2865 did not authorize the UCSC strike but invited the UC to bargain for a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA. However, the UC has refused to reopen its contract with UAW Local 2865 so far. The contract, which has been in effect since August 2018, will expire in June 2022.  &#8220;We formally asked UC to come to the bargaining table and negotiate a cost of living adjustment months ago - and they continue to refuse,&#8221; Iyengar said in the statement. &#8220;Instead they have consistently tried to do an end run around the union in both the bargaining and discipline process.&#8221;  UC spokesperson Andrew Gordon said in an emailed statement that reopening negotiations would defeat the purpose of a signed agreement and would be unfair to other UC workers adhering to collective bargaining agreements.  The UC  filed  unfair labor practice charges against UAW Local 2865 on Feb. 24 for not stopping the UCSC wildcat strike. In response, UAW Local 2865 filed its own unfair labor practice  charge  against the UC on Thursday for allegedly failing to bargain in good faith and interfering with the rights of workers and the union.  The latest UAW Local 2865 complaint alleges the UC violated several sections of the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act. It alleges the UC retaliated against the 54 UCSC workers following the union's request to bargain and selectively disciplined individuals in union-represented positions but not in non-union-represented positions, such as research assistant positions.  The complaint also alleges the UC unilaterally prohibited workers from securing employment in spring quarter and bypassed official discipline procedures by using the Code of Student Conduct for employment acts.  Gordon said in the statement that the UC is sympathetic to the high cost of living that graduate students experience but added that these strike-related activities negatively impact undergraduate students.

Council meetings are open to the public and held monthly. The next meeting will be held virtually on June 3.   Announcements     Starting Friday, select businesses in Westwood will be reopened after coronavirus-related closures. Florists, toy stores, bookstores and car dealerships will offer curbside service, and golf courses and trails will be opened with enforced social distancing requirements, said Jasmine Shamolian, Westwood field deputy.    Westwood now has 36 coronavirus testing sites open and testing is now open to everyone, symptomatic or asymptomatic, according to Tanaz Golshan, the West Valley area representative for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Both drive-through and walk-up sites are now available for Westwood residents, Golshan said.      The UCLA campus will receive about $20 million to be distributed to UCLA students seeking financial assistance because of the pandemic, said Jamie Kennerk, a field representative for California State Assembly member Sydney Kamlager.     Agenda     The council retroactively approved the purchase of $658.94 worth of groceries from Ralphs to be distributed to stakeholders of the NWWNC experiencing homelessness in Westwood. This money was issued by NWWNC President Michael Skiles as emergency funding  last month.      The council unanimously approved a donation of $1,000 to the Los Angeles Parks Foundation that will be used to purchase supplies for those living at the Westwood Recreation Center, which is temporarily serving as a homeless shelter.     The council retroactively approved the expenditure of  $1,000 to the Westwood Village Improvement Association, used in April to purchase  discounted meals  from local Westwood restaurants and distribute for free to frontline health care workers at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. As members of the WVIA, NWWNC members Peter Clinco and Kevin Crummy recused themselves, but Josh Trifunovic, despite also being a member, did not.       The council requested the refund of Neighborhood Purpose Grants, which were distributed to fund community events that may have since been canceled because of COVID-19, including a free concert from the  Kaleidoscope Chamber Orchestra , a conductorless chamber orchestra, and the music festival  Far Out Fest . The organizers of Far Out Fest have committed to refunding the council, but the council has yet to get in touch with the organizers of the other events, said Joey Russel, an undergraduate student member of the NWWNC.    The council discussed potentially asking the LA Department of Transportation to establish a ""slow streets"" program in Westwood for the duration of the stay-at-home order. This program would create several pedestrian-only streets to allow residents to exercise without the interference of traffic. No resolution was reached, as the council members noted that because the streets are virtually empty, the program is unnecessary.   ",[],"['news', 'westwood']",

In my four years at this paper, I have lost my confidence and sometimes my will to wake up in the morning. I have cried over Daily Bruin more than I did over my last two relationships ending.   So why do I keep coming back? Why did I sign on to be an editor in my senior year when I was expecting to switch my focus to my future career?  I consider myself to be a pretty vanilla person, but E. L. James should take notes on the kind of paddle Daily Bruin smacked me with because, let me tell you, I have never felt such rewarding pain. So maybe I have a simple case of Stockholm syndrome, or maybe it&#8217;s, well, far more complicated.  I looked forward to going to college my whole life. I always imagined I would finally find a group of like-minded individuals, and we&#8217;d sit in our dorms talking about life and politics and yadda yadda; you already know the fantasy that Hollywood sells in Gilmore Girls.   When I got to UCLA, Daily Bruin handed me my dreams on a silver platter. I went from puttering around my small town photographing street lamps and the sun through tall grass, and pretty much anything else you&#8217;d find on Instagram circa 2012, to photographing Ted Lieu, protests and Stagecoach. All of a sudden, I had resources, good cameras and people to actually help me learn what to do with all of it. I found some of my best friends. We even had Rory-style wine nights during which we shared our entire life stories and stayed up talking about how much this country sucks until 2 a.m.  But unfortunately, the silver platter also turned out to be a silver dagger.  I didn&#8217;t expect to experience imposter syndrome going into college. Academically, I have been fortunate enough to feel assimilated. But the imposter syndrome didn&#8217;t hit in the classroom, it hit in the newsroom. Every photo shoot I shot was not good enough. I didn&#8217;t know how to take full advantage of different camera settings. Even when I felt confident during the shoot, I felt frustrated when I looked at the photos after. By the time I finally achieved something I was working toward, it seemed everyone else had achieved more. When I became an editor, it only got worse. Every mistake I made was on full display for everyone to judge. Errors were no longer personal; every little mistake reflected on the entire paper. Journalistic integrity loomed overhead like a dark cloud waiting to strike me down with a bolt of lightning.  By my second year of editorship, I was exhausted. I struggled to socialize. Everything I did was an attempt to make the Video section more cohesive and journalistic, but it never felt like enough. I constantly craved recognition for my work, but I hated myself more for wanting it. I had been waiting my whole life to feel really seen and understood by my peers, and I finally realized it wasn&#8217;t going to happen, at least, not in the way I wanted. Eventually, I broke.  It took me far too long to accept that Daily Bruin is just a newspaper; Kerckhoff 118 is just a building; our office is just a room; and all the emotional turmoil I experienced was because of my own insecurities, not because of a student newspaper. I know I&#8217;m not alone in feeling this way because honestly, Stockholm syndrome could learn a lesson from watching the ways in which everyone at this paper happily throws aside their sanity just to print a paper that five people will pick up for a crossword puzzle we don&#8217;t even create.  While sometimes I feel like a victim returning gleefully to my captor, I was really only ever a victim of myself. No one ever could have said anything positive enough to make me realize I was good enough.  But Daily Bruin gave me a safe place to learn how to be OK with failure.  As it all comes to an end, I can&#8217;t hate Daily Bruin. I can&#8217;t even be a little mad. It&#8217;s not an evil institution seeking to ruin student lives and steal their voices. It&#8217;s not a Disney villain. Being at Daily Bruin and suffering for Daily Bruin made me realize I was not OK with who I was. It made me realize I was too insecure, too unwilling to take risks, too afraid of failure and too afraid of not being the best.  I always wanted to succeed at everything I did, but until I became an editor, I was not faced with challenges in which succeeding was that rewarding. It&#8217;s all too easy for me to focus on my shortcomings, but thanks to this newsroom, I have also experienced great triumphs. I tried leading a photography club in high school, and let me tell you, that was a shitshow compared to how I handled the leadership of being an editor. There is truly something about that newsroom that breaks you down and leaves you to pick yourself back up, but having the mere space to do so without severe consequences is a blessing.  Daily Bruin made me doubt myself more than anything else ever has. It made me doubt my career path. It made me doubt my major. It made me doubt my photography skills, leadership ability and virtually every aspect of who I am. I don&#8217;t think I have ever felt worse about myself than how I felt as an editor at Daily Bruin.  But pain is unavoidable if you want to reach great heights. So I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing.

But some of the lasting effects are glaring, and some have yet to manifest.   One of those lasting effects for UCLA is the lost revenue from unplayed games.   The financial crunch comes at a tough time for UCLA Athletics, as they are suffering from their first budget deficit in 15 years. In 2004, the deficit stood at $164,000. For the 2019 fiscal year, the shortfall nearly reached $19 million, leaving newly announced Athletics Director Martin Jarmond with an uphill battle to fight.  Apart from the obvious stakeholders &#8211; players, coaches and fans &#8211; there are numerous other parties that turn the wheels of UCLA Athletics.  Equipment managers. Nutritionists. Trainers. Peer learning facilitators. Practice players. Gameday workers. Data analysts.  For students whose jobs involve hands-on work with athletes, a remote learning environment means fewer real-life experience and, consequently, a cascade of snowballing effects.  The UCLA Sports Medicine Internship Program is a three-year professional development program in which student trainers gain experience in sports medicine through close involvement with UCLA Athletics. This is paired with additional coursework, professional observation and in-service training sessions from professionals.  Interns are assigned to specific teams and tasked with creating rehabilitation programs for the athletes under the supervision of a certified athletic trainer. Sydney Wu, a fourth-year physiological science student in her final year of the program, said interns tend to the athletes before and after practices and competitions, serving their physical and mental health needs.  In-person work for student trainers came to a standstill when the NCAA announced all sporting events were canceled on March 12 as a result of the pandemic. For Wu, this meant not getting to finish her final season alongside the gymnastics team.  &#8220;My experience with this program has really just been amazing getting to know these athletes, so to have this abrupt stop, (especially when) I was in the middle of season, ... it was startling,&#8221; Wu said.    As a result, face-to-face interaction between athletes and program interns has been replaced by weekly emails of athlete injury reports, Wu said.  Khyla Corpin, a third-year physiological science student in her second year with the program, said despite the lack of in-person training, the sports medicine program has still been effective in ensuring students continue learning.  Students still have in-service training sessions hosted by athletic trainers every two weeks, meet with their professional mentors and learn from presentations from older interns in the program &#8211; these activities have just been adapted for the online setting, Corpin said.  But looking forward, turning a program largely based on hands-on experience into a virtual setting is a challenge.  In the spring of their first year in the program, students take an introduction to athletic training course where they learn the skills they&#8217;ll need to begin working with UCLA teams. However, many of these skills &#8211; such as learning how to properly tape athletes &#8211; are difficult to teach online, Wu said.  &#8220;That&#8217;ll be a huge learning curve for (first-year interns), because they can&#8217;t be corrected by their athletic trainers (over Zoom),&#8221; Wu said. &#8220;At least I&#8217;m glad that they did have those two quarters to be able to interact with the athletes and staff, because I do think that&#8217;s important.&#8221;  Additionally, Wu said the incoming intern class will face significant challenges in the event that fall quarter is online.  Not only is the beginning of the program important in acclimating the interns to the facilities and staff, but Wu said the first year of the program serves as an observational period in which there are three rounds of cuts.  Wu said at the end of winter quarter, first-year interns who pass an interview process are locked into the program, which makes performance during the first two quarters extremely important. She worries it will be harder for students to stand out during the cut process if the program is remote, which would be further complicated if fall sports &#8211; like football &#8211; have their seasons pushed back entirely.   Combined with the fact that prospective applicants are still required to submit their applications either in person or by mail &#8211; as online applications are not accepted &#8211; the program could overall become less meritocratic.   For students like Corpin, who are looking ahead to their final year in the program, the pandemic&#8217;s uncertainty may have implications on graduate school and career plans &#8212; in addition to academic progress.  &#8220;I&#8217;m definitely worried about my learning and growth as a student athletic trainer, especially since we recently just learned how to evaluate injuries,&#8221; Corpin said. &#8220;I feel like missing out (on in-person training) for so long affects the confidence (seniors) will have in taking on a (mentorship) role.&#8221;  Corpin said lost opportunities for professional shadowing, clinical hours and building relationships necessary for letters of recommendation are all concerns for students.  A lot of graduate school applications require a certain number of clinical and shadowing hours, which complicates the logistics of applying for students who didn&#8217;t fulfill these hours before the pandemic began, she added.   With social distancing limiting the number of people allowed in clinical settings and reducing the number of nonessential surgeries allowed, Corpin is also concerned about not being able to complete her surgical observation case, which is typical for seniors in the program.  Usually the internship culminates in a case study where interns walk an athlete through the entire rehabilitation process, starting with their surgery and ending with their return to competition. While some students&#8217; cases were interrupted by the pandemic, it&#8217;s unclear what lies ahead for this part of the program next year.  &#8220;A lot of people &#8211; including me &#8211; were banking on this program to really be that thing on our resume that we can talk about and get all our experience from,&#8221; Corpin said. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult &#8211; just the thought of not being able to complete the program the way I thought we would be able to.&#8221;  Other student worker roles that revolve around the traditional day-to-day routine of a team have had their jobs come to a screeching halt.  Michael Ross, a second-year economics student, pined for his current role with UCLA baseball since his high school days. After his acceptance into the university, Ross got in touch with coach John Savage and secured a position with the team.  While given the title of &#8220;data analyst,&#8221; Ross said his duties with the team ranged from equipment management to data analytics to video logging to laundry. All in all, he devoted 20 to 40-plus hours a week, with the workload picking up in the spring.  Without any games being played, Ross has very little on his plate. No clothes to wash, no data to analyze and no videos to log. His only obligation is a weekly Zoom team meeting to keep everyone on the same page.  Professionally, Ross is hoping to parlay his experience with the team and the network he has been able to build into an entry-level role in sports. In the meantime, Ross has put his summer sports-related internship search on hold, as numerous roles have been postponed or canceled in response to the shutdown of the four major U.S. sports leagues.       For other student workers, their jobs are less impacted by the remote nature mandated by the university.  Dan Armitage, a fourth-year Asian American studies student, has not seen a massive change in his role as a peer learning facilitator after the school shut down, apart from a couple technological hiccups with Zoom.  &#8220;I've had some issues with the connection and just basic issues with audio and video,&#8221; Armitage said. &#8220;Beyond that, I personally don't think that it's been affected that much in terms of the level of engagement that I've been having with students.&#8221;  Armitage&#8217;s workload and compensation have stayed the same, while the attention he&#8217;s been receiving from student-athletes has not dimmed.  But Armitage&#8217;s employment modification during the pandemic tends to be the exception, not the norm.  While Jarmond and UCLA Athletics will look to avoid the financial downturn from the 2019 fiscal year, Wu, Corpin and Ross will hope their jobs revert to the normalcy of 2019 as soon as possible.

When Ayers first encountered Anderson, a friend told Ayers that the punk rock singer was trouble. But Ayers said that only enticed her to make a documentary feature titled &#8220;Last Fast Ride: The Life, Love and Death of a Punk Goddess.&#8221; She said the documentary highlights the life and death of raucous punk rock star Anderson and her relationship with the punk community. The 2011 film will be screened Thursday at the Charles E. Young Research Library Main Conference Room as a part of the UCLA Library documentary series. Ayers said Anderson's trauma and lifelong struggle to heal intrigued her and became central to the film.  ""The more I heard about (Anderson), the more I thought this woman is amazing,"" Ayers said. ""She had been through so much trauma, and she was able to live her life and make music.""   [Related:    Mother and son craft play depicting punk scene in 1980s Los Angeles   ]   Ayers said performing on stage was a way for Anderson to work through trauma in her past. The Insaints, a band Anderson formed with guitar player and friend Daniel DeLeon, was an up and coming staple in the San Francisco Bay Area hard punk rock scene of the early 1990s, Ayers said. Up until Anderson's death, Ayers said the Insaints were on a successful trajectory similar to that of Rancid, The Offspring and Green Day. Ayers said it was these bands that led the transition from grunge rock bands of the late 1980s into an era of hard punk.  But Ayers said Anderson and the Insaints did more than leave behind the softer grunge rock sound of bands like The Clash, Misfits and Ramones, notoriously all-white and all-male bands. Anderson was one of only a few females headlining a punk rock band during her time, Ayers said.  DeLeon, Anderson's bandmate, said she was seen by many of her peers as the mom of punk rock. Compared to other punk rockers, Ayers said Anderson had a voice reminiscent of a psychobilly Gwen Stefani &#8211;   one that was clear, loud and feminine. And though   DeLeon said the band didn&#8217;t think much of having a female lead when it played privately, he said Anderson intimidated people in public performances.      &#8220;She was a crazy punk rock Amazon woman on stage,&#8221; DeLeon said. &#8220;I watched her break tables and get in fights, and we would call it her freedom of expression.   That&#8217;s the part of punk rock history that not a lot of people have heard about &#8211; the freedom of expression.&#8221;      ""Last Fast Ride"" producer and  Anderson's long-term partner Danielle Santos Bernal said that, despite Anderson's Amazonian impression, the punk community accepted her. T  he hard punk scene was one that appreciated outcasts and intimidation, and Bernal said that made it the perfect community for Anderson&#8217;s voice. Bernal said that when there was something the punks wanted to do, they would do it, and when there was something that angered them, they would fight it. However, since Anderson&#8217;s time with the Insaints in the early '90s, Bernal said punk has changed.  &#8220;(Punk) doesn&#8217;t seem to have that same kind of edge that it used to,&#8221; Bernal said. &#8220;The edge is dulled now.&#8221;   [Related:    Album review: Green Day leaves boulevard of broken dreams in wake of underwhelming 13th album   ]     Bernal said the softening of punk is a result of social media&#8217;s influence. Concerns over likes, comments and even sponsorships in the age of influencers have made the newer generation of punk rock artists more reserved, she said. DeLeon said punk has become more accepted and mainstream in recent years, leaving behind the outcast identity common to many punk artists in the '80s and '90s. But punk isn't dead. In fact, Bernal said hard punk is on the verge of a modern resurgence with the next generation, but it just hasn't reached the surface quite yet.  Even   with its many phases   throughout the decades, DeLeon said punk has always been therapeutic &#8211; a getaway from the rest of the world. Wild, erratic and sometimes lewd performances on stage were a way of healing from trauma and reclaiming one&#8217;s body, Ayers said. For Anderson in particular, who survived alleged abuse and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression, Ayers said punk was an escape for her; the punk community was her family.  ""All we had to do was love this music, and we were accepted,"" Bernal said. ""Whatever tragedy you have been through, whatever abuse, whatever addictions you&#8217;ve got, we&#8217;ve had them, too, and you&#8217;re not alone.&#8221; ",[],"['arts-entertainment', 'film-tv', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ae_.punkgoddess.courtesy.jpg

The class is part of the program's Healing Online for People Everywhere (HOPE) series that aims to provide free online classes on building resilience and improving mental health. Ping Ho, a professional partner with UCLA and the founder and director of HOPE, said she created the series shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Originally, she said   the program sought to provide accessible online programs to help the general public with finding mental stability and self-care through participation in the arts.  Its unfortunate for the context in which HOPE has grown, Ho said. But theres a silver lining that HOPE is here with the resources needed to provide people with a healthy channel to find comfort and a sense of being in difficult times.    The Zumba class is one of the first long-term programs in the HOPE series   and will     hold its   last session Tuesday after running for almost two months.   Instructor Tessie Herrasti said the course was created to help people use dance to find a channel for self-expression and to reconnect with their bodies. Her previous experience teaching Zumba in Paris helped solidify the creation of the course as well as influence the core values she hoped to propagate. For Herrasti, the focus of the program is less on the physical movements and more on self-awareness through the exploration of space and emotion.  I encourage my students to participate to whatever degree they can, Herrasti said. While Zumba has traditionally been used for fitness purposes, here its used as a method to get in touch with oneself.   [Related Links:    Dance showcase provides students with platform to share experimental works   ]   Herrasti said ideas of self-expression and self-validation are integral to helping people find a sense of stability. Throughout each class, she said she checks in with herself and her students, encouraging them to tend to their physical needs through rest and hydration. By listening to the needs of their bodies, Herrasti said the class encourages participants to practice better self-care and adopt a healthier mindset during challenging times.  One of Herrastis students, Barbara Ketchum, said Herrastis approach to Zumba has introduced a sense of regularity to her everyday life. Ketchum has been a long-term participant in many of HOPEs programs and an attendee of the Zumba class since day one. While she was originally attracted to the course as a way to exercise, Ketchum said Herrasti's focus on self-care made the class a central part of her life in quarantine.  Its something that I've come to count on, Ketchum said. I get to exercise in my room, work up a sweat, and I feel a lot livelier and energetic after its all over.  The musical and cultural diversity Herrasti brings to each class helps introduce new elements into everyday life, Ketchum said. Unlike other Zumba classes which may simply play common pop songs, Harrasti introduces music and dance styles from different genres and cultures. By pulling from Indian or Celtic dance traditions, Herrasti said she intends to further the expressiveness and relatability of her sessions. This diverse approach is part of the social-emotional-arts style that is central to her course's principles.  Part of (social-emotional-arts) is about making everything very inclusive, Harrasti said. For warmup, I have these exercises where we stretch the limbs and spine to explore the space around us, and throughout the session I always encourage free expression through movement.   [Related Links:    Dance piece Phoenix invokes Greek mythology to portray struggle of life   ]   Herrastis expression-focused approach has made the course exceptionally accessible, Ketchum said. As a first-time Zumba student, Ketchum said Herrasti's nurturing teaching style has helped her destress and encouraged her to listen to her body, which has resulted in a calming effect that carries into her daily life.  While the class is set to end soon, Ho said there will still be other opportunities to participate in similar programs. For those who have missed out, Ho said the team at HOPE is currently working on creating videos of these classes and uploading them to their website to make the content permanently available for the public. To fulfill the program's mission, Ho said HOPE will continue to hold regular events throughout the year that will continue to foster a sense of well-being.  HOPE was created to help more people find a healthy lifestyle, Ho said. Through social-emotional arts, we can continue to create inclusive events and safe environments for individuals to reconnect with themselves and practice self-care.",['cap-yiqing-hu'],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/zumba_draft-1024x683.jpg

The group of 12 students performs comedic sketches each annual Spring Sing. However this year's virtual platform has forced them to re-start the writing process to perform sketches that don't require in-person gatherings. Student Alumni Association Company directors Katie Byrne, a fourth-year English student, and Katie Wong, a second-year communication student, said they wanted to tweak the scripts to remove large public settings and events that would usually occur on campus from the plot points. Byrne said all of their changes have been in an effort to be respectful of the new state of the world.  Although we told everyone to look back at (the) old sketches and see what could be filmed separately or could still work for the present situation, a lot of the work we had done before couldn't be used because it wasnt necessarily pertaining to or tactful to use for our present situation, Byrne said.  Instead of their previous plans, Wong said they decided to have the students create new scripts during their free time and discuss them during conference calls.   One of the adjustments they have had to make is the loss of immediate reactions from the group when they pitch ideas, she said. When brainstorming in person, students are able to talk at once and understand each other's suggestions and opinions right away. Through Zoom, they have had to become more patient, as they mute themselves to hear scripts, and provide feedback one after another, Wong said.  Returning Company member Jake Garberg, a fourth-year English student, said the main struggle for the team was getting used to working independently and separately.  People were in a weird mental state the first few weeks, Garberg said. We had to grasp a better idea about what kind of content we wanted to make, and how to make that content feasible.  However, Garberg said the first day of filming proved to be promising for the group. The students filmed a sketch entirely on Zoom with the help of the recording option that comes with the application. Garberg said it felt strange to act out a fake Zoom call when it was a real means of communication for the actors. At the same time, the experience solidified that it was possible to film sketches even when everyone is physically separated, Garberg said.  Digital mediums like Zoom, such as FaceTime and Instagram Live, will help Company relate to the audience most this year, as that is how many students are communicating from home, Garberg said.  And Companys goal remains the same  to provide comedic commentary and relief on the student experiences during the past school year, Wong said. However, Byrne said they want the audience to take away a sense of connectedness from their sketches, as the lack of community events may make students feel isolated. The sketches will try to relate to the new adjustments students have had to make as college life has transitioned online, Byrne said.  These laughs can be shared by students all in their homes individually, but theyre all watching and laughing together, which gives people this connected feeling, Byrne said. If theyre watching, and theyre texting their friends ... students are brought together on a mutual platform about UCLA that they might feel they dont have right now.  Although the news of Spring Sing moving online was disappointing, Byrne said this is the first time Company has had to make such a sudden change, which inspired them to shift their mindset. While they acknowledge that students have had to adjust to the new norms of college life, Garberg said they want to find ways to provide comedic commentary on the current situation all while being respectful and sensitive to those watching.  The biggest challenge for me is being able to tie it back to the UCLA experience specifically, because we all feel very disconnected from campus right now, Garberg said. Although its a challenge, I think thats whats important. Thats what we have to do to make this all feel like were going through the same thing, because we are.",['cap-julie-lee'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Company-1.jpg

The garments not only mimicked the look of the outfit, but also included quick-change features that allowed Rose to replicate Gaga's rapid red carpet transformation.   The extravagant   look was just the latest project for Rose, who has continued to design and create   costumes at home despite the challenges of balancing school work and material constraints.  It was totally up my alley, Rose said. (Lady Gagas look) is the   (most fun). It's not just one look, it's four of them, and they're all so unique and fun in their own way.  The #MetGalaChallenge was created by Vogue and Billy Porter once it was clear that the 2020 Met Gala was canceled as a result of COVID-19, said Maria Kozanecka, production coordinator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The hashtag offered online creators the chance to showcase their re-creations of looks from past galas. Kozanecka said the challenge was a fitting complement to the planned 2020 theme About Time: Fashion and Duration because it allows participants to look back at past outfits that stood the test of time.   [Related:    2019 Met Gala: Styles that embodied camp, ones that failed to meet the mark   ]   Rose said she   heard about the challenge from a friend who participated and chose Lady Gagas look from last year's camp-themed gala, a theme rooted in LGBTQ+ culture and characterized by aesthetic spectacle and exaggeration. Gaga stepped onto the red carpet wearing a voluminous pink dress but removed clothes as she walked up the carpet, creating three more distinct looks in the span of about 15 minutes  a black dress with a bustle, a pink fitted dress and black lingerie. Rose said Gaga's transformative appearance was the most feasible to make with supplies from around her house, given that she typically shops in small businesses in the Fashion District that have temporarily closed.

Materials for this look were: - and old laundry bin - Carboard - Fanny pack - Scrap black fabric &amp; muslin - Zip ties - old photo backdrop - a lot of hot glue/thread/pins - Pink bedsheets - clothes/accessories from around the house - and my blonde lio (promare) wig haha . .

Though Rose often thinks outside of the box in terms of fabrication, the challenge pushed her outside-the-box design process, said friend and fellow cosplayer Vanessa Fano.  ""She really got good results with fabrics that she usually doesn't ever use,"" Fano said. ""Because ... she usually goes to the Fashion District, she usually has patterns already set out, but this was one of those where she kind of made her own thing entirely just with household supplies.""  After that, Rose   started building the undergarments and understructures of the look, specifically focusing on the exaggerated hip pieces of the first dress. Rose then searched her house looking for materials with the right shape, eventually finding the laundry basket and cutting it in half   to place on either side of her hips, she said.  [caption id=""attachment_383509"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""627""]    The second outfit Rose made is a black dress with an exaggerated bustle, which she constructed out of an old photo backdrop she had in her home. (Courtesy of Shay Rose)[/caption]  The laundry basket wasnt the only household item Rose transformed into high fashion. Originally, she had planned to make the second layer  a black ballgown    using trash bags but found the material difficult to work with and had to rethink her approach.  There was a point where I was just stuck a little bit because I couldn't find the right material, Rose said. Then I again wandered around my house, looking for whatever was black, and then I saw my old photo backdrop. ... I eventually just sacrificed it for the cause.""  Timing also posed an obstacle   for Rose  the challenge was announced April 22 and submissions were due by May 3, right in the middle of Roses midterm season. The time crunch meant Rose had to split her attention between studying and designing, eventually completing the full look in just a week.  To display the outfit, Rose planned a backyard photoshoot with creative substitutes for her paparazzi and entourage. While her mom filmed and photographed, her dad donned a suit and helped her with her costume changes, emulating Gagas umbrella-wielding crew that assisted her on the   Met   Gala   red carpet.   [Related:    Design media arts student debuts latest collection at New York Fashion Week   ]   [caption id=""attachment_383512"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""692""]    Rose not only recreated Gaga's outfits, but also modeled them the same way Gaga did on the red carpet. Assisting her in the photoshoot, Rose's dad even emulated Gagas crew that assisted her on the Met Gala carpet. (Courtesy of Shay Rose)[/caption]  After Rose posted the outfit online, it quickly caught the attention of both Vogue and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which featured Rose's work on their websites as one of their favorite looks from the challenge. Kozanecka, who curated The Mets article, said she focused her attention   on the process that creators put into their looks, as well as the level of detail, accuracy and ingenuity.  (Creators) were getting hands-on and finding an expressiveness about the item of clothing and the person who was wearing it, really bringing it to life, Kozanecka said. What stood out (for Rose) was her sense of performance. She took it an extra level where it wasn't about just recreating a performance, but recreating a mood.  Rose said she was thrilled with the online reactions because she loves when people are as excited about her work   as she is. Now that the Gaga look is complete, Rose is continuing to work on other costumes ,  including the aerial outfit worn by Zendayas character in The Greatest Showman. With each   of her   projects,   Rose   said she picks the costumes she recreates based on her personal reaction to the look, working to make it a reality.  'The Greatest Showman' one, actually that's one of my favorite costumes because I do aerial silks,"" Rose said. ""So for that one, I'm probably going to plan a little aerial routine. It's just whatever I want to make, I just make it.""",['cap-olivia-mazzucato'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.ripmetgala.courtesy.jpg

I know the term copy editor doesnt really mean anything to a lot of people, so Ill just give you a brief idea of what the people sitting at that large table at the back of Kerckhoff 118 do.  The job of the copy editor is to comb through an article to make sure it is accurate and consistent down to the last detail. So, for the duration of my undergraduate career, Ive spent hours making sure all the crafty commas are where they should be, that every amongst has been stripped down to its American counterpart among, that so-and-so event really did happen at so-and-so time and place, that professors really are professors and not just lecturers, and that this line  and this line  and this line - are all used properly.  To put it simply, a copy editor lives in the details.  So perhaps it makes sense that, when COVID-19 messily gnawed off the last chunk of my undergraduate career, what I really mourned was the details. When I thought about what Id be missing, I didnt really think too much about those big, traditional senior moments, like commencement in Pauley Pavilion or graduation photos at golden hour or dipping my feet into the Inverted Fountain.  Instead, in true copy editor form, I focused on the little things.  I thought about all the times someone asked me when Kerckhoff Coffeehouse closed, all the times someone asked if I could plug in their laptop charger for them, all the times someone explained to me how baseball or tennis worked because I could never remember.  I thought about all the times wed order Veggie Grill together on the mobile app, all the snacks we ate in the conference room, all the times someone called the printer and wed all hold our breaths waiting to hear the magical words, Yep, looks good. I thought about all the crises  because there were a lot of them  that we somehow managed to solve, even though it was hours past deadline.  I thought about the path I always took to get home after a long shift, a path as worn down as my favorite pair of shoes, a path that has led me through the dark for four years: Turn left because the front doors locked at this point, take a right but say goodbye to all the people turning left, go down the stairs, stroll through Bruin Walk, struggle up the hill, disregard the light at the crosswalk because there are never any cars this late at night anyway, take the second path to the right, and from there its straight on till morning.  I thought about all the candy wrappers scattered around the Design computers, all the times we fought over a comma at 1 a.m., all the plastic spoons we took turns stealing from Ackerman Union and stored in an origami boat, all the witty remarks wed write in our audits.  I thought about all the custom emojis that have sprouted from niche inside jokes about hummus and corn and Paul Koretz and sour cream, all the times I uploaded PDFs of the newspaper first through Cyberduck and then through email, the irony of having Windex as the sole cleaning solution in a windowless room, all the times someone helped me craft the perfect headline.  I thought about how, if you stayed in the office long enough, you could hear the loud, clashing hubbub of shouts and laughter trickle down to a tired, meditative murmur.  I thought about all the times Id joke about quitting but then stay way too long in the office.  I thought about that, and so much more.  What can I say? Im a copy editor. The details matter  and they mattered because of the people I got to share them with.  So, to all the generations of copy editors who took the little things as seriously as I did, thank you. Thanks for keeping me around. This was all for you. Cheers.   Ye was a Copy contributor 2016-2017, slot editor 2017-2020 and News contributor 2018-2020.

The five-person group is a synthesis of different musical backgrounds and levels of experience, with various members having roots in jazz fusion, funk rock and nearly everything between. The blend of styles will be on display with the group's single, ""If Only,"" written by third-year theater student Tieren Salstrand. As Wild Phlox's singer and rhythm guitarist, Salstrand said the continually building instrumental and vocal elements of the song have evolved to reflect the song's message of dealing   with mental health and addiction to end in triumph.    'If Only' started as a dialogue between someone who's struggling with something they can't stop and someone that they love very much, Salstrand said. It kind of evolved into a dialogue between someone and a personification of their depression kind of falling away or losing grasp of reality.  Wild Phlox   officially formed in mid-January, leaving the band only a few weeks to prepare for its Spring Sing audition, said Dylan Coe, a fourth-year geography and environmental studies student  . Initially, Coe was part of an instrumental band with first-year physics student and drummer Rishi Acharya along with mechanical engineering graduate student and lead guitarist Diederik Beckers. As the trio considered the possibility of performing in Spring Sing, Coe said they began to   look for a vocalist to add to the band  .    That's when Salstrand and Kiarah Davis  a third-year musical theater student, pianist and singer  came into the picture. At the time, Salstrand and Davis had already been working on ""If Only"" as a duet. But   as the two groups merged into one, they expanded upon Salstrands initial version of If Only by   adding variation in chord progressions and solos as well as a more definite structure to accommodate more instruments, Coe said. Throughout the process, Salstrand said the band helped him not only   refine and develop the song, but his own guitar skills as well.  ""(Coe and Acharya) were amazing at being understanding of my frustration at my lack of musical knowledge and were able to lend hand,"" Salstrand said.  For Coe, one of   the song's strongest aspects is that it includes a solo from each member, allowing for a culmination of the entire group's effort. With guitar, bass and drum solos, the piece gives each instrument and member   a shining moment.    And beyond the solos, Salstrand said the band also collaborated heavily to achieve a buildup of sounds and rhythms in the single. ""If Only"" begins with a single guitar strum, but as vocals and other instruments come into focus, he said   the song shifts from an initially dreamy feeling into a faster and more complex melodic experience.   Additionally, dispersing the key sonic elements of each solo throughout the   entire   song's entirety created a stronger musical delivery, allowing for more of a jam with the drum and bass solo toward the end, Salstrand said.  Since the   song   has numerous moving pieces,   Salstrand said the rehearsal process has been increasingly difficult as members have had limited access to their instruments. Acharya specifically has not been able to practice with his drum kit, he said. Moreover, the group has not done any rehearsals all together since shelter-in-place orders went into effect, and Acharya said they have had to keep up with their work individually.  However,   Acharya said it will not be to difficult for Wild Phlox   to reestablish its sound, considering the amount of time its members devoted to rehearsing before the pandemic.   While   Spring Sing is taking on a virtual format, Coe is still optimistic about the opportunity, as he came to UCLA with specific hopes of performing in the event.  ""(Spring Sing) was my dream,"" Coe said. ""Even before I set foot on campus, I told myself that if I don't do anything else except play in Spring Sing, I will be happy with my UCLA experience.""  &nbsp;  And this year, Coe said he is honored to be able to perform in Spring Sing with Wild Phlox's fusion of musical styles. Although the band said its sound crosses many genres, for Acharya, it's clear its music is purple  a color that results from a blend of others      which is what he said led them to name the band Wild Phlox,   a flower of the same color.  We decided that our music is really purple, not just If Only, but all of our songs are somehow purple, Acharya said. We found that Wild Phlox was a kind of purple flower and that's how we settled on our name.",['cap-emily-sweet'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Wildphlox-1024x1024.jpg

Council meetings are open to the public and held monthly. The next meeting will be held virtually June 3.   General Public Comment     Westwood Community Council Chair Steve Sann alerted the council to the significant impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the businesses of Westwood Village, urging council members to consult business owners before arguing for new policies. Many businesses in the Village have been forced to close due to lack of foot traffic in Westwood, including ""legacy businesses"" Stan&#8217;s Donuts and Helen&#8217;s Cycles. Flame Broiler, Victoria&#8217;s Secret and 800 Degrees Woodfired Kitchen have also been forced to close and may not reopen.     Agenda     The council passed a motion to remove forms of  hostile architecture  in Westwood by a 10-3 margin. Councilmember Andrew Lewis proposed removing dividers from benches and public spaces that prevent people experiencing homelessness from sleeping comfortably on public benches. &#8220;If people cannot sleep comfortably above the ground, they will sleep uncomfortably, or on the ground, and neither of these are a public good,&#8221; said Grayson Peters, member of the council&#8217;s transportation and safety committee.      Peter Clinco, owner of Skylight Gardens, voted against the measure and said the removal of hostile architecture is a temporary solution to the much larger problem of homelessness in Westwood. The removal of such architecture will encourage homelessness, Clinco said, and may dissuade people from conducting business in Westwood. Councilmembers Josh Trifunovic and Kevin Crummy also voted against the motion.      The council unanimously approved a resolution urging the city of Los Angeles to continue accelerating the repaving of traffic corridors during the coronavirus pandemic without infringing upon the implementation of Mobility Plan 2035, which calls for the creation of more bike lanes and upgraded crosswalks.      The council passed a motion to support Project Roomkey, proposed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, which calls to secure hotel and motel rooms for unhoused individuals statewide during the COVID-19 crisis. The project aims to limit the spread of the virus on city streets and within homeless shelters by providing hotel rooms as temporary shelters. The council passed an amendment encouraging Los Angeles to coerce, rather than incentivize, hotels to provide rooms for those currently unhoused.      The council voted unanimously in favor of requesting that the Los Angeles Department of Transportation establish a &#8220;slow streets&#8221; program while stay-at-home orders are in place. This program would close off streets across LA to vehicular traffic, including Broxton Avenue and Gayley Avenue, designating them as ""slow streets.&#8221; This would allow locals to walk or exercise safely along Westwood streets while adhering to social distancing guidelines. The council previously discussed the topic during its  May 6  meeting.   ",[],"['news', 'westwood']",

Beginning with black and white pieces, Jackson&#8217;s monochromatic series will then move from warm hues to cooler shades. The purposeful color progression ties closely to the evolution of emotions from fury to sorrow, she said.   &#8220;I want to capture rage; I want to capture sadness; I want to capture grief; I want to capture mourning,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;I want to pay homage to the (civil rights) movement before us and how we kind of morphed (from it). ... The struggle is still there. It never actually went anywhere.&#8221;  [caption caption=""Jackson has been creating artwork in the hopes that it will bring awareness and visibility to the Black community.

Overlaid on a portrait of a Black man, Jackson etched the words, &#8220;A black man was lynched by police yesterday&#8221; to illustrate that lynchings &#8211; a practice that emerged in the United States after the Civil War &#8211; still continue in the modern day.  Art&#8217;s commercial value can also contribute to social reform, as other creators are selling their work to aid the Black Lives Matter movement. Alumna Natalie Perez said she sought to support the   cause without physically protesting, as she wanted to minimize her and her family&#8217;s exposure to COVID-19. Instead, Perez is taking digital commissions in exchange for a donation toward an organization that supports the Black Lives Matter movement.  &#8220;Even though Black organizations need help all year round and all the time, this time is especially important because there&#8217;s so much intensity going around with these situations,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;(My goal is) spreading awareness about this and getting donations.&#8221;  [caption caption=""Perez is taking digital commissions in exchange for a donation toward an organization that supports Black Lives Matter.

For a contribution of $5, she said the donor can receive a simple sketch with no color, while a donation of $15 would grant a fully colored and more detailed piece.  The idea of selling art in return for donations to the Black Lives Matter movement is prevalent beyond the UCLA community as well. Maya Hull, a student at Chapman University, said the activism of others inspired her to design and sell stickers with all proceeds going toward the Black Lives Matter organization and the NAACP.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had the (chance to create) something political or about justice,&#8221; Hull said. &#8220;I think this is a really (valuable) opportunity for me to use art for good and not just as easy consumption &#8211; to actually make an impact.&#8221;  By digitally designing and selling two different stickers, Hull said she has reached her $1,000 goal and will continue creating them to raise donations. One sticker features lightning bolts and the phrase &#8220;BLACK LIVES MATTER&#8221; three times in warm shades while the other reads &#8220;No Justice, No Peace&#8221; in colorful fonts. Hull said the latter&#8217;s evergreen message fits its simple design and the former&#8217;s bright color palette corroborates her positive message of support.  [caption caption=""Hull digitally designed two different stickers to sell, with all proceeds going to the Black Lives Matter organization and the NAACP.

As compared to other forms of media, Perez said visual art's ability to evoke a visceral reaction from the viewer by using only one sense closely links the medium to social justice.  &#8220;Art has always been a part of protest culture and media because it&#8217;s part of the humanities &#8211; it&#8217;s a reflection of how we view society,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect medium because it says so much visually. ... You can just feel it because you see it so deeply.""  Yet outside the current context of protest culture, the Black Lives Matter movement and social activism do not suddenly pause after the protests end, Jackson said. In the ongoing crusade, she wants Blackness to be profoundly visible &#8211; a goal that she is contributing to with her own art. Jackson&#8217;s disappointment in seeing little Black representation during her many visits to the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery encouraged her to create pieces that elevate and illuminate her community.  &#8220;I currently made it my mission to put us in those spaces,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;I want us to be highly visible. ...

But for Kreidler and the rest of the players in major league organizations, that reality never materialized.  The former UCLA baseball infielder is waiting &#8211; along with the rest of baseball &#8211; for Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball to make a decision on the 2020 season in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MLB and its players' bargaining union, the MLB Players Association, have yet to come to an agreement about how, if or when the 2020 season will be played, but Britt Ghiroli of The Athletic   said on May 31 that members of the Washington Nationals organization have been told the 2020 MiLB season will be canceled.  In his three years in Westwood, Kreidler played in 170 games, batting .261 and slugging 16 home runs. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 2019 MLB Draft by the Detroit Tigers and spent his first professional season playing for the Connecticut Tigers &#8211; rebranded as the Norwich Sea Unicorns following the 2019 campaign &#8211; Detroit&#8217;s short-season Class A affiliate.  Instead of spending the year with the high-A Lakeland Flying Tigers &#8211; which he said was his hope after his performance in spring training &#8211; Kreidler has said it is difficult to stay sharp in such an unprecedented situation.  &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to prepare for a season when you don't have an end date (to the offseason) in mind,&#8221; Kreidler said. &#8220;Normally, you have a spring training to build up to, or a high school or college season. For us, we just have to be ready for games. That&#8217;s pretty difficult &#8211; it&#8217;s a hard task to ask (of players).&#8221;  The second-year professional has gone back and forth from his Davis home to the Los Angeles area, where he works with hitting coach Doug Latta &#8211; a trainer who has helped MLB players like 2018 American League MVP and current Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder  Mookie Betts, at the Ball Yard in Northridge, California.  The two have been working together since the end of Kreidler&#8217;s 2019 campaign, and have continued their lessons, albeit with added precautions.  &#8220;(We&#8217;ve been) doing protocols, taking temperatures, washing hands a lot and making sure the players coming in (were in quarantine for 14 days),&#8221; Latta said. &#8220;(Our modified training) allows (Kreidler) to work a little bit more on movements and mechanics &#8211; what we call little refinements.&#8221;  [caption caption=""Former UCLA baseball infielder Ryan Kreidler &#8211; a fourth-round draft of the Detroit Tigers in 2019 &#8211;  has seen his professional baseball journey, and the minor leagues as a whole, altered by the pandemic.

His first professional team now shares his feeling of uncertainty because of the coronavirus.  Like many other minor league teams, Norwich found itself in a rough spot financially because of the pandemic, and even before the outbreak, the Sea Unicorns were on the list of 42 teams scheduled to be eliminated by the MLB, according to BaseballAmerica.com.  Kreidler said he enjoyed his time in southeastern Connecticut and disagrees with MLB commissioner Rob Manfred&#8217;s decision to eliminate a team that means so much to the people of Norwich.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a bummer &#8211; the town of Norwich is a close-knit community and they were going to lose a lot by losing that team,&#8221; Kreidler said. &#8220;As a player, it's disheartening that somebody wants to cut out your livelihood, the team that I just played (60) games for. The lower levels of minor league baseball are very important to the development of baseball players. You need to go through struggles and you need to play in different leagues and environments in order to grow.&#8221;  Sea Unicorns&#8217; Senior Vice President C.J. Knudsen said he anticipated the state would potentially only allow gatherings of up to 50 people by June 21 &#8211; the slated date for the team&#8217;s home opener.  He said any delay to the season would impact many Norwich residents who are dependent on the team for employment, as well as the city itself, which has made a sizable financial investment in the club.  ""If we're only allowed to have 50 people at our games, we're not going to come anywhere near being able to bring in enough revenue to operate the business,"" Knudsen said. ""It's about 150 people that, if we don't play this year, literally would not have a job.""  Minor league players, who have been hearing about the future of their jobs at the same time as the general public and are without their own union, are not immune to the financial hardships of the pandemic. Kreidler said some friends and teammates of his have been forced to adjust to uncertain job security.  On May 26, Oakland Athletics' owner John Fisher announced the suspension of the $400-per-week payments to the organization's minor leaguers, starting on June 1, citing lack of revenue as the main reason. The Athletics were the first major league team to furlough minor league players,   and although Fisher walked back his decision June 5, multiple teams have followed suit.  Kreidler said the Tigers have yet to inform the players of a similar decision as of May 22, and the organization has continued paying out its $400 weekly stipends while not  making roster cuts as of June 3.   MLB also shortened its 2020 draft from the typical 40 rounds to just five, and the former fourth-round pick said draft prospects not selected could lose out on valuable signing bonuses and salaries.  &#8220;As a player, you work 18, 20 years to get to a point (where you&#8217;re ready to be drafted),&#8221; Kreidler said. &#8220;To have it all taken away from you like guys did this year (with the draft-shortening decision) and how minor leaguers are feeling with the elimination of some affiliates, it&#8217;s pretty disheartening. But I guess that&#8217;s just the reality we&#8217;re presented with right now.&#8221;  Kreidler, despite expressing a desire to return to the diamond, said he was still grateful for his personal situation and his occupation as a professional baseball player.  &#8220;In the grand scope of what&#8217;s going on in America, it's a small price to pay for playing a game,&#8221; Kreidler said. &#8220;We&#8217;re lucky to be baseball players, but it is a weird time.&#8221; ","['cap-taiyo-keilin', 'cap-michael-waldman']","['baseball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/grad.sp_.milb_.nbk-01.png

The newly established organization, created by third-year communication student Kira Loren, is feeding those who experience homelessness in Westwood as it attempts to connect the UCLA community with its surrounding city members, she said. Prior to the pandemic, the club was dedicated to making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which Loren said was ideal because of its nonperishable ingredients and ability to generate a laid-back environment ideal for socialization. However, as social distancing measures made such gatherings difficult, Loren said she decided to switch the club's focus to donating canned foods instead.  &#8220;(Once classes got canceled), I immediately just started brainstorming other ideas on how we could use our funding to help out in ways like donating canned food,&#8221; Loren said. &#8220;We were super bummed (we couldn't make PB&amp;J sandwiches anymore), but we&#8217;re working to adapt to the situation.&#8221;   [Related:    Student's fundraising efforts can be chalked up to passion for sidewalk art   ]     Founded in January, the club focused on social media and word-of-mouth to promote itself and thought the recruiting process would be a slow one, said vice president Kennedy Meyer. But the third-year human biology and society student said the club's concerns were quelled when over 25 students showed up at its first meeting, raising the the board members' optimism as they envisioned the club's future.  Before the pandemic impacted everyday life, Loren said Club Sandwich   set its community foundations by purchasing its sandwich materials solely through fundraising efforts and funding from the Undergraduate Students Association Council. After over 65 sandwiches were prepared and packaged properly in zip-close bags with positive messages written on them, she said she drove to the Salvation Army in Westwood to drop it all off. Writing messages gave students not only the chance to spread peanut butter and jelly but also hope,   which is something Loren said the club wanted to continue as it switched to buying and donating canned foods.   [Related:    Alfred brews up solutions to keep coffee, matcha in hands of Angelenos   ]     Despite the club being recently founded, third-year psychobiology student Jacquelyn Hill said board members' feelings of excitement quickly turned into those of uncertainty as they realized they would not longer be able to provide for the community as they had planned.   After USAC approved the idea to switch to canned foods, Loren said she is now purchasing the nonperishable foods to deliver them to the Salvation Army, prompting a new era for Club Sandwich.  ""A lot of stores are closed due to all the protests and looting, but once that's opened up, I'm going to direct all that money towards canned food and donate it,"" Loren said. ""I'm going to talk to the Salvation Army again and see if they're in a good place to donate to again or other homeless shelters in Los Angeles.""  Although Club Sandwich didn&#8217;t have the year it expected, Loren said she is committed to evolving its mission on feeding people who experience homelessness, regardless of how the next school year pans out. If circumstances allow, the board members plan to go back to their roots of making sandwiches by fall quarter and hopefully partner with local sandwich businesses to help expand their efforts. Loren said the club will continue to apply for funding from USAC to provide food for people experiencing homelessness and possibly help start up more Club Sandwiches throughout other universities.  &#8220;It will always be a little heartbreaking to think about like all the sandwiches we could have donated, but you can&#8217;t dwell on the negativity,&#8221; Loren said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll continue thinking of new ways to help and as we all look forward to next year.&#8221; ",['cap-aaron-untiveros'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.ae_.clubsandwich.DR_.jpg

California will join 13 other states and American Samoa in voting on March 3, when 34% of the 3,979 delegates will be assigned to Democratic presidential candidates. The change was proposed by the office of the California Secretary of State and approved by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2017.  Pushing the primary up to Super Tuesday is supposed to give California a bigger say in choosing the presidential nominee, said Mark Peterson, a public policy professor.  (In) the past, when California would hold its primary in June, pretty much by that time who was gonna be the nominee from either party was more or less settled, Peterson said. It didnt make a lot of sense that California, the largest state in the country (by population), was so insignificant or inconsequential to the process.  However, moving the primary date up to March might not make a difference after all, said Jeffrey Lewis, a political science professor.  In general, when we think about moving it up, the idea is that the sequence of the contest affects who the ultimate winner is and you get more influence if you're earlier in the process, Lewis said. The problem is there could have been a lot of influence at the end.  Holding the primaries in June made California more relevant in the race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016, as it showed which contender ended up having the lead, Lewis said. Clinton won California that year before eventually clinching the nomination.  Candidates performance in the March primaries could serve as an indicator of their future performances, Lewis added. But these candidates might have the same outcome regardless of what time of the year primaries took place, he said.  Think about a basketball team or football team, Lewis said. They dont lose games late in the season because they lost earlier in the season, they lose games late in the season because theyre not very good at winning games.  A few factors can complicate the primaries, one being that the process is confusing for the 5 million voters in California who are registered with no-party preference, said John Zaller, a political science professor.  Independent voters have to request a crossover ballot by mailing a postcard they receive from the county register. Many are unaware they are nonpartisan and do not know the specific procedures for getting a crossover ballot.  People are going to be confused as independents about how to get a ballot to participate, Peterson said, Its supposed to be pretty straightforward at the voting centers, whether or not people understand that when they want to vote by mail. I think its harder.  Critics have also raised concerns that the California primary may appropriate its delegates unfairly, Zaller said.  In California and many other states, candidates must reach a 15% threshold of votes to get any delegates. This means that a candidate with 14% of the votes will get no delegates and his or her delegates will be discarded and awarded proportionally to those who breached the threshold.  This means front-runner candidates will be disproportionately rewarded, Zaller said. In early primary states, this has already rewarded the Democratic presidential front-runner Bernie Sanders, he added.  Sanders has 47% of the delegates from the first three contests but only roughly 26% of the vote, Zaller said. So hes been getting a big advantage of that.  A fractionalized Democratic field and the 15% rule means a large bonus of California votes will be unequally awarded to Sanders, Zaller said.  One concern with adding California to all the other Super Tuesday states is that candidates with less organization and resources are unable to campaign in all these states at once, Peterson said.  Super Tuesday already includes vastly populated states, like Texas. Having a presence in all of these states requires extensive resources, networks and name recognition, Peterson said.  This helps Sanders campaign far more than it does any other presidential nominee because he retains much of his organizational networks he inherited from his 2016 presidential run, whereas candidates such as Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar have practically no network in California, Peterson said.  If we want a system in which we open up the leadership possibilities more broadly, then you need to have a primary process which allows more direct (voter-candidate engagement) that doesnt require a huge amount of money and organization, Peterson said.  Another problem that comes with an especially early primary date is that all the non-presidential candidates also have to run in March, Peterson said. Positions such as the state senator, those on city councils or district courts have not had an opportunity to start building their campaigns.  These officials might then be submerged under the attention given to presidential candidates, he said.  They dont get seen, Peterson said. So we dont know what the down-ballot consequences are. For all these other offices, it adds uncertainty and complexity that wasnt there before.","['cap-seth-freitas', 'cap-genesis-qu']","['california', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/image.png

Well, not in the literal sense. We may be physically   distant when we do these things, but not necessarily socially distant.    Various organizations, media outlets and individuals have  expressed concern  about the inaccuracy of this term and the implicit message that it conveys to the public, advocating for the use of the phrase ""physical distancing"" instead.   With this in mind, The Quad is attempting to distinguish ""social"" from ""physical"" distancing and how these two terms can be used in different contexts during the current COVID-19 pandemic.  Some of the earliest conversations about using the term physical distancing versus social distancing originated among professors in the sociology department of our very own UCLA campus.   These conversations culminated in an Op-ed piece titled  Don't call it social distancing'    published by CNN.  In the Op-ed, UCLA sociology professors Jennie Brand, Cecilia Menjvar and Jacob Foster advocated for using the more accurate term physical distancing to emphasize that remaining socially connected during quarantine is critical for supporting our mental health and   communities.  Brand said that the suggestion to write the Op-ed came up during a departmental meeting shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19.  We started discussing the messaging that was occurring in the media on social distancing, and Cecilia mentioned that it really should be called physical distancing, she said. What were really talking about is just physically separating people. Social connections matter and should be maintained in this time.   [Related:    Theater students improvise virtual methods to replace in-person productions ]   Given the inaccuracy of this term, why did it come into use in the first place? In reality, its difficult to pinpoint exactly how social distancing came to be used in the context of disease control, although the term and the idea of isolating people to prevent disease transmission was first  officially promoted  in the U.S. under the Bush administration.  However, the notion of social distancing was not originally intended to describe a method for preventing disease transmission.  Cultural anthropologist Edward Hall came up with the term ""proxemics"" in 1963 to describe the kinds of social distancing that people practice in their everyday lives. Halls research illuminated the degree to which peoples attitudes toward each other based on various demographic and cultural factors impact their reactions to social distance in everyday life.   The concept of social distancing in his studies was, unlike the current use of the term, actually intended to emphasize the social dynamics that influence peoples physical distance from one another.  Under the current situation,   however, Brand   said that the use of the term social distancing is emphasizing these social differences and dynamics   negatively. Although Halls studies on social space werent framed within the context of a pandemic, his findings highlight Brands worry that the notion of social distancing might drive people to ostracize those who are most vulnerable to the consequences of the pandemic such as those who continue to work on the front lines or have lost their jobs.  If we emphasize something like social distancing, sometimes people perceive that as not engaging with the community and the people who are the most vulnerable,""   Brand said.  "" Theyre creating some distance, maybe some social class distance, and we definitely dont want that message conveyed.     In addition,   Brand stressed that in advocating for the term physical distancing, she and her co-authors also wanted to encourage people to think about how distancing measures are unequally impacting different groups. She said that framing our actions as physical distancing rather than social distancing could remind people to consider other people's experiences while helping to maintain social cohesion and support.  This call for a distinction between the two terms is not limited to academia and the media. Major health organizations such as the CDC and WHO have made attempts to change   their terminology or at least include the term physical distancing on their websites and during conferences to clarify that distancing measures do not preclude staying connected with loved ones.  However, Brand recognized that this shift   in wording will be an upward battle.  ""Once the phrase is out there its sticky, and people start to associate it with what theyre doing,"" Brand said.  "" But we still feel that this is going to be around for some time and probably pick up again in the fall, so its not too late to be thinking about this message and what it conveys.""   [ICYMI:    Napolitano says UCs will likely operate on hybrid basis for fall, decision not yet made ]     While encouraging social awareness and cohesion is critical, do the words themselves actually impact our understanding of distancing measures?  UCLA linguistics professor Jessica Rett said that using the word physical rather than social distancing would certainly be a more accurate way of denoting shelter-at-home orders   given the technological connectivity of the world. However, Rett also said that the extent to which labels impact how we think and behave depends on the context and nature of those labels.  Were used to labels being arbitrary (a rose by any other name would smell as sweet), and were used to focusing more on peoples intended meaning rather than their literal meaning, she said in an emailed statement.  In terms of the current situation, Rett explained that when people hear the term social distancing, they will likely interpret it to mean physical distancing because they understand enough about the context in which it is being used.  Similarly,   Betsy Wo, a second-year linguistics and psychology student, said she had interpreted social distancing to essentially mean physical distancing.  Although she said that it has been challenging to stay in contact with friends, Wo also said that quarantine has allowed her to connect with people she wouldnt normally call or see in person because of her busy schedule and that her time spent video-calling and texting was greater than before.  At the same time, Wo recognized that quarantine is impacting people in different ways and that seeing   the term social distancing in the media might be perceived more negatively for some than for others. She said that one of her friends, who has depression, is experiencing greater   difficulty grappling with increased isolation and the stream of negativity in the news and other media.  Regardless of the degree to which the terms themselves impact the way we think about and carry out distancing, the underlying message promoting the use of the term physical distancing   is a reminder to stay connected not only with our loved ones but also to our communities and those who are most vulnerable to the consequences of the pandemic.  As this hectic quarter comes to a close and we head into the mayhem of graduation and online finals, let's remember to take care of one another and stay socially connected, but physically distant.  &nbsp;",['cap-maya-harris'],"['lifestyle-quad', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.quad_.socialvsphysicaldistancing.MC_.jpg

After winning Spring Sings top prize last year with the a cappella group Bruin Harmony,   the second-year musical theater student will return to the stage as a solo act to perform his original song, Funky Middle. Kohanbash said his love for singing began when he was 6 years old when he would play Frank Sinatra songs on his keyboard.  Since then, Kohanbash said he began writing his own music as he grappled with newfound friendships and relationships upon entering UCLA. For the soloist, music is his way of sharing his thoughts, and performing is how Kohanbash relaxes and lets people into his world to form new connections.  Honestly, when life hits and you experience relationships in a different way that you can't describe emotionally, it takes a higher explanation, Kohanbash said. Which for me was art and music.  Drawing most of his style from his musical theater training, Kohanbash said his experience learning from a leader of a black gospel choir layered his musical influences with R&amp;B, jazz and pop overtones. Mixing these styles in his songwriting, Kohanbash said most of his music is based on past relationships  romantic or otherwise      and has been using his time in quarantine to create an original song about his longing to return back to human connection.  Kohanbash said he seeks the purity in human connections through his songwriting. The song he chose for his performance, Funky Middle, is the first one he ever wrote, and he said it was inspired by the first meaningful relationship he ever had at UCLA. Performed on the piano, Kohanbash said the song revolves around balancing moments of love and companionship.  I think love comes in many different forms, Kohanbash said. Music is one thing that has been able to connect people in any path of life  and ultimately the force at the root of it is love.  This time around, however, Kohanbash said his Spring Sing experience will be immensely different as he is performing completely on his own. Although he has found his support system in the other artists involved, he said he is eager coming into his performance solo. But for Kohanbash, to perform is to generate a dialogue with an audience, and he said he is interested in exploring the spirit of an online crowd.  I am curious to see how I am going to rediscover that energy again from such a vastly different experience with everything being digital and physical distancing, Kohanbash said. I have just been preparing myself for a learning experience.  Having met Kohanbash at first-year orientation, Oscar Revelins said Kohanbashs versatile vocals and simple yet elegant melodies are what set him apart. The second-year musical theater student said Kohanbashs voice ranges from classical musical theatre and Tenor vocals to   smooth, deep baritones for a more bluesy sound. Paired with his original songs, Revelins said Kohanbash devotes all of his time to his music   and has been working independently on his upcoming Spring Sing performance for months.  It is one thing to be a good singer and it is another thing to create your own music, Revelins said. And Daniel is experimenting with these really beautiful melodies and lyrics.  Kohanbashs personal and relatable lyrics drew second-year theater student Ava Alexiades to his music.   His original song Come Back is the first he released on Instagram and Alexiades said the first line, the day has gone and you are my day, exemplifies how much of himself Kohanbash puts into his music. She said each line of his songs leaves her waiting for next, searching for their possible meanings.  Hopeful for the surprises that are sure to come, Kohanbash said the communication and dedication from the Spring Sing committee has allowed him to focus solely on his own preparations. Coming into his performance, Kohanbash said he wants to find support systems wherever he can. He said he hopes ""Funky Middle"" will shed light onto underappreciated human relationships as he takes the virtual stage at the end of the month.  Music is love, Kohanbash said, I have a lot of love in my heart and being able to share that with people is a love language for me.",['cap-yasmin-madjidi'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Danielkohanbash-1.jpg

What he didnt know was how hard it would be to do both at the same time, especially if it involved training for the Olympics.  ""I'm just not going to be able to meet my climbing goals if I put all my energy into school,"" said the first-year undeclared student.   ""So there's definitely a balance that I have yet to perfect, if that's even possible.""  Fulkerson was around 7 years old when he first went to a climbing gym in the Bay Area. Little by little, he kept returning to the gym  he had his birthday party there, went to summer camps and eventually decided he wanted to join the team at Planet Granite Sunnyvale, a climbing gym in Sunnyvale, California.  One of Fulkersons first coaches, Justin Cubbage, said it was a combination of Fulkerson's love for the sport and his natural gifts that allowed him to make climbing more than just a hobby.  The really strong foundation of just passion for the sport has really helped him make the most of the raw talent that he does have, Cubbage said. And I think just having all the mental fortitude to, day in and day out, stay strong and stay committed to your work.  In 2013, Fulkerson saw his dedication pay off when he earned his first youth national championship, which he then won again in 2017. The now-UCLA first-year took a trip in early February to Bend, Oregon, where he placed 11th in the Bouldering Open National Championships at just 18 years old  one of the youngest athletes in a field of full-fledged adults.  Around one week later, he returned to Bend and capped off his career at the junior level  climbers who are born in either 2001 or 2002  by climbing his way to the top of the podium at the Bouldering Youth National Championships for a third time.  But Fulkersons success on the national stage and at competitions has begun serving a second function  one that isn't available to the rest of the Division-I athletes in Westwood. Unlike NCAA athletes, club athletes such as Fulkerson are able to capitalize on sponsorship deals and cash prizes. Companies including Guayak Yerba Mate have helped cover some of his travel expenses, and some of his peers who aren't attending university have reached six-figure sponsorships.  While his climbing resume supplemented his academic achievements leading to his UCLA acceptance, now that he's in Westwood, Fulkerson has realized the facilities at the school are far from ideal for a climber of his caliber.  [caption id=""attachment_376462"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Fulkerson has been climbing since he was around 7 years old, training and competing all over the Pacific Coast. The first-year student is planning on taking time off UCLA to make time for Olympic training. (Amy Dixon/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  UCLA Athletics offers an array of resources and top-of-the-line facilities to NCAA athletes, who are awarded scholarships, given priority enrollment times and are held to different academic standards in the admissions process, according to CalMatters  all of which the university deems necessary for athletes to maintain their athletic prowess.  To compete at the national level demands a commitment of time and energy from student-athletes not normally required of other students, UCLA Athletics states in its department mission statement. Consequently, we provide a variety of support services and resources to assist student-athletes with their academic success, personal well being, individual development, and preparation for future endeavors.  Fulkerson, on the other hand, receives no such resources to go along with his success at the national level.  There is a single rock-climbing wall at the John Wooden Center and it occupies the area of one single racquetball court. Fulkerson said it lacks many  if not all  of the tools necessary for effective training.  ""Some climbing-specific equipment (would) be awesome to have at the gym to make training here a little bit easier,"" Fulkerson said. ""I pretty much just don't train at this wall ever.""  UCLAs club climbing team trains biweekly in the space, but the team is without a coach, and the facilities are not even sufficient for them, according to club climbing media relations chair Leah Towery, who is also a friend of Fulkerson. She said the space is simply too small and ill-equipped for her and the more than 100 other climbers on the team.  We work with what we have, but its really small  its the size of a racquetball court, Towery said. Just having more volume of climbs and ... different climbing walls would be awesome. ... We just really dont have the space for it.  To try and remedy the situation, Fulkerson has started driving to San Diego on weekends  often alone  to train in a more competitive and well-equipped environment.  Ive definitely been off campus more than I've been on campus, Fulkerson said. I've actually been going down there at least 10 weekends this (academic) year. I've only been on campus three weekends total these two quarters. It's been hectic.  His weekly commute and hours of practice  plus additional travel time given up for competitions around the nation  make his schedule comparable to that of a Division-I athlete.  Fulkerson also bears the additional struggle of training without a team. Back in the Bay Area, he said the strong crew of climbers at Planet Granite was a key aspect to his development as a climber  another reason he spends so much time in San Diego with other strong climbers.  [embed]https://youtu.be/EVUb_Poti30[/embed]  With all of the time and energy he pours into his sport, Fulkerson said he is shouldering the same load as a varsity athlete with none of the bonuses that come with it.  It's definitely affected my performance as a student, Fulkerson said. I've been gone literally every single weekend training and competitions, unless I tell my teachers like, Hey, I'm a professional rock climber, I'm trying to juggle a lot of things right now. They don't know. They just see what I turn in.  But the sacrifices Fulkerson makes in terms of his time, effort and academics aren't the only things he has in common with the varsity athletes at UCLA. His ultimate goal is to compete alongside them in the Olympics.  In August 2016  Fulkerson's sophomore year of high school  it was announced that climbing would be an Olympic sport starting in 2020. As soon as he heard the news, he knew it was a dream he would pursue.  Just having grown up climbing with all these guys like (2020 USA climbing Olympian) Nathaniel (Coleman) and these people who are in the Olympics, it's like, 'Wow, I feel like I'm not too far off,' Fulkerson said. I definitely know I can get to their level if not more. Especially like four years, that's a lot of time.  As he works toward the 2024 Paris Olympics, Fulkerson said he has come to realize that he will simply be unable to attend UCLA and train at the same time.  Unlike the Division-I athletes who call Pauley Pavilion and Drake Stadium home, he instead plans to take two years off and dedicate that time to pursuing his Olympic dream.  Even with his temporary departure from Westwood set in stone, Fulkerson said he hopes UCLA will invest in his sport down the line  especially with the 2028 Olympics set to be hosted in Los Angeles.  [caption id=""attachment_376463"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Fulkerson trains in San Diego with professional-level rock climbers, something he said makes it difficult to balance climbing with his school work. (Amy Dixon/Daily Bruin senior staff)[/caption]  UCLA just doesn't know the potential climbing has right now, Fulkerson said. Especially as it goes into the Olympics here in 2020, there's going to be so much more to gain on UCLA's end from having a good climbing team and there's just so much money already pouring into the sport and the growth is insane.  Whether UCLA is likely to raise funding for climbing in time for Fulkerson to have the resources necessary to stay in Westwood while training for the Olympics is unknown. But with everything he's done to get to where he is now, Fulkerson said he has sacrificed too much to give up.  I want to see it through,"" Fulkerson said. ""I'd definitely regret just letting that go. It's part of the reason why I really want to really commit to the Olympics and not half-ass it, Fulkerson said. I know I can do school and climb, but there's a lot of sacrifices that I don't think I'd be willing to make if I looked back and said, 'Oh, yeah, well I could have done it better.'",['cap-jake-greenberg-bell'],"['club-im-sports', 'features', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.Fulkerson.feat_.ADX_.jpg

At UCLA, our community is remarkably united by similar feelings of loss, confusion and concern, but also by light, hope and perspective that the pandemic has brought to the forefront. In Columns From Quarantine, Daily Bruin staffers and community submissions highlight the personal stories that mark this unprecedented moment. If you have a quarantine story to tell, you can submit it    here    or email    columnsfromquarantine@gmail.com .        [embed]https://youtu.be/medtGDdKiwU[/embed]  Today marks my eighth week of quarantine. Ive seen 56 sunsets, watched about 26 hours of movies and listened to something like 16,000 minutes of music. All from the comfort of home.  In a world that gets dubbed as so big and so scary, the smallest layer of your world  your own brain  can have so much uncharted territory. And for some of us, exploring that for 56 days can be kind of terrifying.  As I sat down at my kitchen table Tuesday of finals week in winter quarter, analyzing some story I didnt care about for a class that had already ended, I found myself spiraling down different trains of thought.  In one, I mourned the loss of people Id never met: an old man from Italy, a young woman from Washington. In another spiral, I became anxious about the quick disintegration of a life Id spent so long working to achieve at UCLA. In yet another, I became equally grateful and guilt-ridden for the privilege that allowed me to sit in front of a computer in a home with my family puttering around me  a seemingly simple scene thats not a reality for everyone right now.  Beginning my papers thesis was quickly lost in this tangled mess of spirals. So, I opened Spotify.  I started compiling the voices of Lauryn Hill, Stevie Nicks and Elliott Smith  the ones that slow the world down for just a couple minutes  into a playlist.  As I began to take my sadness out on my music choices, queuing slow ballad after sad song, I let the soothing voices of my favorite artists fill the air around me while I sat in my room  suddenly feeling slightly less alone. I started to accept that while the world was obviously not feeling normal, maybe I wasnt either.  For many, feelings are reactionary  just lofty ideas you can brush off. But as someone whos struggled with mental health, both firsthand all throughout high school and secondhand through my closest loved ones, I know feelings to be a dangerously uncontrollable force.  The first week of quarantine, I alternated between nights of sleeping too much and nights of hardly sleeping at all; days of not eating at all and days of snacking gluttonously; hours of tirelessly refreshing my Twitter feed and hours of attempting to finish my online finals. Waking up brought on a dread for the monotony of the day to come, and talking to anyone sparked a fresh anxiety about the news updates they might give.  While the situation of COVID-19 is universally novel, I recognized my reactions as old habits and dangerous feelings that had been revived from a distant memory. And with most of my learned outlets unavailable given the pandemic, I felt the quicksand of my old way of life sucking me back in.  Luckily, melodies, lyrics and beats were immune to stay-at-home orders and viruses. Playlists like the one sarcastically named "" oh its ENDING ending "" became a source of solace  one that, at first, dramatically reflected how truly doomed the world felt.  I began to listen to it on repeat.      After a few days of drowning in anxious reactions to every CNN notification and sad realizations of what I wouldve been doing if life were normal, I overheard my neighbor singing along to Oh! You Pretty Things by David Bowie. I giggled as she attempted to fill both the roles of Bowie and his piano with just her voice.  When her performance ended, my smile stuck around.  Without really knowing why, the next few days felt lighter. My focus drew itself toward small things, like beating my sister in Taboo or perfecting my chocolate chip cookie recipe, and slowly began inching out the darkness that once inundated my brain.  I started a new playlist and called it "" the birds are still chirping. "" And while I still felt the sadness of the pandemic unfolding outside, I began to allow the voices of HAIM and David Bowie push back against the strength of the quicksand.      Perhaps theres only so much variety my childhood home can provide, or perhaps the world has become too much like a sci-fi horror movie. But my feelings and my thoughts  the least tangible, most intimate part of my world  have had the least shakeable and most palpable effects on me these past few weeks.  While some days are characterized by an appreciation for the extra time with my family, others are marked by a profound sadness for the global struggle we are all enduring. On some days I dance around like a little kid singing along to Dua Lipa and Tove Lo, blasting my playlist "" break out (while still staying in) .""      On other days I pretend life is normal for three minutes at a time while nodding along to Smino and Noname on "" ignorance is bliss? "" attempting to resemble some ounce of normalcy from my prepandemic life.      And on some days when no words at all suffice, I turn on "" quarantini mix "" and I sit listening to the sounds of Odesza and Petit Biscuit to drown out the world around me. Through all of them, I lean on the shoulders of artists when my own thoughts get too heavy to carry.      Its been a quarantine of spirals  of feeling a little more intensely and with a little less control. And so, for me, its been a quarantine of listening to playlists that match my feelings.  My city, Oakland, California, announced a couple of weeks ago that it will extend its stay-at-home order until at least May 31. Thats another 20 days trapped inside the tyranny of my moods.  But what Ive learned so far is that moods often dont last forever  and hopefully, neither will this quarantine. So listen to my playlists or make your own.  Your mental health is important, and at the very least, we still have our tunes.

It was a way to pass time &#8211; like most other first-years, I didn&#8217;t really have a ton of (read: any) close friends to do that with. I had a lot of time to kill, and the runner&#8217;s high was a nice &#8211; albeit temporary &#8211; distraction from the loneliness of being in a new place surrounded by a bunch of people who you don&#8217;t really know.  During that same quarter, I applied to write for the Daily Bruin as an Arts &amp; Entertainment contributor. I submitted my application days before the due date &#8211; since I didn&#8217;t have anyone to celebrate with really, I went out for a quick run around the campus loop. On my way out, someone stopped me.  &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re in my English class, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;  It&#8217;s a wonder I managed to hear her over the Carly Rae Jepsen song I was blasting in my headphones as I prepared to jog down to Sunset Boulevard. But alas, I stopped, and we talked a bit about the class reading we had been assigned for the weekend. As we were both first-years, the topic of conversation quickly made its way to what clubs we were interested in joining, and we bonded over the fact that we both wanted to join the Daily Bruin.  Before we parted ways, we took a quick moment to add each other on Facebook &#8211; as silly as it sounds, I distinctly remember thinking, &#8220;Wow, I just made my first friend,&#8221; as I trotted off on my evening run.  Actually, I have a lot of stories like that. A good deal of the people I met as a freshman happened to join the Daily Bruin at the same time as me. I didn&#8217;t meet them through the paper and we didn&#8217;t plan on applying together, but we connected over the fact that we had, by chance, joined the same organization. Even one of my roommates ended up joining the paper as a Design staffer.  At first, the more involved in the paper I became, the less I ran. I was busy going to training and doing interviews and addressing edits and hanging out with the other newly minted Daily Bruin staffers that I met. I didn&#8217;t need to kill as much time. I stopped feeling so lonely.  Eventually, I applied to become an assistant editor for the paper. On the day applications were due, I holed myself up in The Study at Hedrick with another A&amp;E contributor, Sidra, and Amy &#8211; the aforementioned first friend &#8211; and we worked on our editor applications together. Shortly thereafter, I became an editor, and quickly grew lost in editing first drafts and trying to find stories that would fill up my share of the A&amp;E page.  The stress got to me. I started running again, this time, for the opposite reason from before: The long hours in the office overwhelmed me, and I needed to be alone for once. If there were a lot of stories on my desk, I would go out and run.  When a writer or my top editor asked why I was taking so long, I&#8217;d quickly message back, &#8220;sorry i&#8217;m on a run rn, i&#8217;ll get to it later&#8221; and then slap on a smiley face at the end so I wouldn&#8217;t seem too negligent or uninterested. Quite literally, I was running away from my problems.  Sorry, guys.  I didn&#8217;t really think I would remain an editor for the paper after my second year &#8211; it didn&#8217;t feel like it was for me.  Then Amy roped me right back in when she became the paper&#8217;s managing editor and convinced me to apply to become the paper&#8217;s Blogging editor. I was hesitant since I didn&#8217;t know any of the Blogging writers and was quite burnt out from the stress of being an assistant editor. But I did it anyway, and I truly cannot thank Amy enough for convincing me to do so.  Still, when editing articles for The Quad for Grad Issue &#8211; literally the first big project new editors work on &#8211; proved harder than I expected it to be. I almost up and quit. Instead I frantically messaged upper management and went on a run.  Eventually, editing and revamping The Quad&#8217;s content schedule became a fun project. Over time, I managed to strike a balance between having an active life outside of the Daily Bruin and actually getting down to business (and having fun doing so). While the progress with The Quad wasn&#8217;t super evident during my tenure as the section&#8217;s editor, seeing the way The Quad has flourished this year under my former assistant editor, Molly, and her assistant editor, Olivia, has been the most rewarding aspect of my entire Daily Bruin experience by far.  Now, this is usually the part of these columns where people thank their co-editors and friends and wish their successors good luck. But since I&#8217;ve got too many people to name and am already over the word limit on this column, it looks like I&#8217;ve got to go out for a run.

But the most anxiety-inducing factor isn't even related to academics &#8211; it's the expenses.   The absurdly high cost of living near campus has forced students to   rethink their decisions to attend the No. 1   public university in the nation. Westwood has been consistently named the most  expensive  place to rent in California, with an apartment costing $4,944 a month on average, and is   topped nationally only by three neighborhoods in Manhattan.  Corporate executives and broke   undergraduates shouldn&#8217;t be paying the same for housing, yet UCLA students fork over exorbitant amounts every month.           And Westwood isn't making it any easier on students.   The neighborhood is  notorious  for its strict regulations regarding zoning and use of space, stemming from the meticulously crafted  Westwood Village Specific Plan  and the  North Westwood Village Specific Plan , which both mandate numerous requirements for new construction. Of particular issue is a mandate that new residential units build parking for each unit in the North Village, where the majority of students live. Building parking not only adds to the cost of construction but limits the space that developers can use to create affordable units.  Thankfully, the North Westwood Neighborhood Council&#8217;s transportation and public safety committee  approved  a motion Feb. 4 that recommended removing parking minimums from zoning regulations, which it will discuss with the council&#8217;s board at its upcoming March 4 meeting.   The removal of parking   minimums could make rent more affordable in the North Village by reducing the cost of construction. Considering the crushing expenses students already have to deal with, the NWWNC would be working directly in the interest of students by removing the minimums.   Beyond affordability, a change to the current policy would also carry the beneficial side effects of discouraging students from bringing cars they don't need while simultaneously encouraging the use of more sustainable forms of transportation.  If the council chooses to endorse this proposal, it will move from a council member to the city council, ultimately ending up on the desk of the city planning department, according to Grayson Peters, the NWWNC transportation and public safety committee chair and a third-year political science student.  It sounds like a lot of red tape, but if approved, these changes might come more quickly than most.  Peters said that despite the extensive bureaucratic process necessary to implement the change, effects could be seen by the mid-2020s.  &#8220;This is essentially a long-term proposal looking at reevaluating strict regulations on land use in Westwood for the next several years,&#8221; Peters said. &#8220;Rent, availability, walkability and future traffic ... these issues would be simpler if our specific plan didn&#8217;t mandate these (parking) requirements.""  With new transit options like the LA Metro's Purple Line Extension and the proposed Sepulveda Transit Corridor Project on the horizon, the necessity for personal cars in this walkable neighborhood becomes questionable.  Public transit is expanding in LA &#8211; and it's   both cheaper and more environmentally friendly than contributing to rush-hour traffic with four empty seats.    Metro is currently reworking its bus routes, having reevaluated its system and collected thousands of public comments to improve service. It&#8217;s well-understood that public transportation can reduce  emissions   , and in LA's car-crazed culture, discouraging residents from gratuitous driving could be a proactive step toward mitigating climate change.  And the drawbacks of parking requirements aren&#8217;t limited to the redundancy of having a car in a college town.  Michael Skiles, president of the NWWNC, said that as the neighborhood surrounding UCLA, Westwood&#8217;s policies should cater to the needs of students rather than forcing developers to spend on costly and unnecessary amenities.  &#8220;One of our constant goals for the council has been to promote housing developments around UCLA that students can afford, (and) in our view these parking minimum requirements get in the way of that goal,&#8221; Skiles said. &#8220;Just about every apartment has to have two and a half parking spaces per unit. They're going to have to pay a lot more to dig subterranean garages, which inevitably gets translated into higher rents.""  Not only do students typically not need cars at UCLA, but removing parking minimums would also be a step in the right direction for discouraging their use in favor of more sustainable options.  Of course, students have expressed concern that not being able to bring a car to school would prevent them from accessing jobs or internships outside of Westwood &#8211; or even strip them of their agency to travel about LA as they please.   But such concerns are misplaced.   Michael Manville, an associate professor of urban planning, said that lifting these requirements will not bar anyone from bringing a car.  &#8220;Ending (the minimum parking) requirement does not mean that the planning police show up and confiscate your car &#8211; it's not a retroactive law,&#8221; Manville said. &#8220;Some students will still want to have cars, and Westwood developers, if they want to make money &#8211; which they do &#8211; will build parking.&#8221;  And as of now, these requirements effectively force developers to continue providing an amenity that many students don&#8217;t need.  &#8220;It is literally illegal to build an apartment in Los Angeles for a bunch of people who don't own cars,"" Manville said. ""I think the fact that the requirements have been in the law so long is the only thing that prevents us from understanding how unnecessary and how harmful they are.&#8221;   Paying to attend UCLA is expensive enough, and high rent makes succeeding here more difficult than it needs to be.       But by removing parking minimums in the North Village, the council can   reduce the financial burden that the vast majority of Bruins bear.

Thats all I can think about toward the end of my runs.  The only runs Ive ever been on in life were the miles I had to run in middle school for physical education class.  Dont get me wrong, I love exercising and you can usually find me playing basketball at the John Wooden Center until the courts close  I just hate running for the sake of running.  But as the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread beyond anything I could've ever imagined, I left UCLA during finals week to go back home. I wanted to stay in shape but realized I was largely inconvenienced by the fact that the courts near my house began to close and I could no longer play basketball. So, I decided to dust off an old pastime  I reinstalled League of Legends.  And it sucked, or rather, I sucked. After losing what seemed to be my 10th straight game, I knew I had to get out and do something, so I sat down at my laptop and decided to make a running playlist.  I titled it, I AM NO LONGER EMO.  This first run was one of those ""emo"" runs, and no, it wasnt because I was losing in League of Legends.  The past year of my life was arguably one of the toughest. My grandfather had passed away. My family was fighting a lot from the grief that comes with losing a loved one and the added stress from having to deal with economic instability.  Simply put, things were just really hard.  And school just seemed to make it worse.  Everyone else seemed to be getting the internships of their dreams, making new friends and moving on with the rest of their lives, but I just felt stuck. I tried to talk about my problems to my friends, but as the days turned into weeks and the weeks turned into months, my problems didnt change. Still, none of that was the worst part.  What killed me was how everyone around me thought I should be better by now.  I felt alone.  And as a Christian, my faith was shaken. I started doubting everything I believed in and started wondering if there even was a God, or anyone at all for that matter, that loved and cared for me.   ""Simply put, things were just really hard.""    So with that heart, I made the aforementioned running playlist. Maybe it was me trying to convince myself I wasnt the only sad person out there, or maybe I just wanted to sit with my feelings, but either way, the playlist was a bunch of sad songs. From old classics like Daniel Powters Bad Day to current hits like Powfus death bed, every song was dark.  After I finished the playlist, I put on my running shoes, grabbed a water bottle and started running.  As I ran, the same doubts and anxieties filled my head. Will I ever amount to anything? Will my family ever get better? Will I ever get better?  And then I got to the end of my run; all that was left between me and home was a huge hill. I started running, but that turned into a jog, and that turned into a walk, and that walk turned into a stop.  I bent over with my hands on my knees and tried to catch my breath. And thats when I realized: This isnt it.  You see, while I had been questioning everything for the past year, I had also prayed occasionally for God to just give me a breath of fresh air; I didnt need my problems gone forever, I just wanted a chance to catch my breath from dealing with all the turmoil around me.  And maybe this pandemic afforded me the chance to get away from the whirlwind of college. Or maybe it was just because I was distracted by physical exhaustion. I dont really know what it was, but in that moment of me gasping for air, I finally got a breath.  I finally had a peace I hadnt felt in a long time.   ""I don't really know what it was, but in that moment of me gasping for air, I finally got a breath.""    When I got home, I pulled out my laptop, after washing my hands and thoroughly sanitizing them, of course, and made a new playlist titled, Being emo is boring. The playlist was filled with songs that reminded me of who I am, like the old Christian hymns Amazing Grace or How Great is Our God. When I finished the playlist, I put in the description a single question: Will this last more than two days?      A month later, the playlist is alive and well and Im still running, albeit not much faster.  COVID-19 has caused a lot of harm to this world, and Im sure many have been affected a lot worse than me. But one thing Im grateful for is the second wind God has given me through it.  At the end of my runs, the hills still there, just like how my problems are still here. And many days, I still want to give up. But the only way home is up the hill, and the only thing I can focus on is on taking the next step.  Left. Right. Left. Right.

No. 2 UCLA beach volleyball (11-2) swept both Oregon (3-5, 1-1 Pac-12) and Washington (3-4, 0-2) on Sunday afternoon 5-0. Every court in each match of the day finished in two sets for UCLA, as it continued its undefeated streak against both teams.  In their first dual of the day against the Ducks, the Bruins only went to one extended set on court four. Freshman Rileigh Powers and redshirt freshman Jaden Whitmarsh gained UCLAs second point on court four, defeating Oregon 23-21, 21-6 after court two clinched the first point.  After the win alongside Whitmarsh, Powers was then paired with redshirt sophomore Hannah Phair against Washington, making court four the only one with a lineup adjustment since Saturday.  (Coach Stein Metzger) can put anyone with anyone and well always do our best, Powers said. Its just good to get other people practice and stuff just so theyre prepared to go in at any given moment.  Whitmarsh had not played in competition since Feb. 29, when UCLA faced off against Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi. Phair had not seen action since the Feb. 22 match against Stanford.  Metzger said the switches in the lineup were meant to give some of the teams reserves a chance to play in case any circumstances change later in the season.  You never know whats going to happen down the stretch, Metzger said. Were lucky that we have great players who are reserves and were confident in them. So we want to just give them opportunity to get some game-time situations, feel a little bit of pressure so that theyre ready to go if we ever need them.  Later in the day, the Bruins swept the Huskies on courts two, four and five to gain the dual-deciding first three points for UCLA.  Court ones senior Savvy Simo and sophomore Abby Van Winkle brought the fourth point and limited the Huskies to their lowest-scoring match against the Bruins of the day, taking their court 21-16, 21-10. The duo tied court five for the fewest number of points allowed against Oregon as well.  We just really clicked together and our focus was just to come out super hard, try different things and that was kind of our goal, Van Winkle said. So we just had a mindset of coming out and playing our hardest.  This weekends Pac-12 South tournament has given the Bruins four more wins to add to their undefeated streak at home since 2016.  That feels great, Metzger said. Weve been lucky to have great athletes that want to come to UCLA. Weve built a great program on the backs of the athletes that came before this group. ... And were in a good spot right now. We just need to stay focused on the prize and continue to get better and better because everyone around the country is doing the same.  UCLA will travel across town Wednesday to face off against No. 5 USC (5-4) for the second time this season and against No. 9 Pepperdine (2-3) for the first time in nearly a year.",['cap-zoe-willoughby'],"['beach-volleyball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.bvb_.wrap_.KL_.jpg

Returning to her electro-pop roots, Lady Gagas unapologetic lyrics and nostalgic disco beats make Chromatica the ultimate summer dance party soundtrack. The 16-song album grapples with the singers struggles of fame, the   search for her own identity and her innate love for music. Following her country-inspired album Joanne and her Oscar-winning performance   in the film A Star is Born,"" Gaga has rightfully reclaimed her pop throne with her newest album.  Entering the world of Chromatica with the minute-long, instrumental opening track, Gaga welcomes listeners into an album filled with raw lyrics and powerful electronic tones. The first act delicately balances the sentimental dance beats reminiscent of her debut album The Fame, while evolving her lyrics with personal vulnerabilities, singing ""Could you pull me out of this alive?/Where's my body? I'm stuck in my mind"" in reference to her life in the limelight in ""Alice.""  Gaga stands up for herself as an artist in Rain On Me, wherein she celebrates her life for what it is, rather than allowing traumas shes faced to hold her back. Gagas commanding spoken vocals paired with her powerful belting voice in the chorus captures the attention of listeners and makes one thing clear  the Mother Monster is back.  As the album continues, Gaga explores new, calmer dance beats to showcase her feminism in Free Woman. She chants ""This is my dancefloor I fought for,"" owning her identity as a capable, independent woman as the bouncy nature of the song embodies the futuristic land of Chromatica.""  The following track, Fun Tonight, while lyrically forgettable in its repetition, still provides the head-bumping and shoulder-swaying tones present in every classic Gaga song. Filled with light-hearted and pulsating dance club beats, Gaga uses the first act of ""Chromatica"" to heal from her past trauma, by touching on themes of sexual assault and substance abuse.   [Related Links:    Album review: All Time Low honors its past, delves into more mature themes in Wake Up, Sunshine   ]   Following the interlude ""Chromatica II,"" the album continues into its second act. Dramatic string instruments perfectly lead into the pounding beat of 911, which is perhaps the highlight of the album. Alien-esque auto-tuned vocals paired with a modern 80s tune embodies the ultimate new Chromatica era of Gaga. Through futuristic synths, she reveals that her biggest enemy in fame is herself. The repetitive nature of the song's lyrics also highlights the cyclical quality of Gaga's past self-destruction that has been broken by her newfound self-realization.  Throughout her career, Gaga has been the definition of a pop star  from her red carpet meat dress to eccentric music videos, she has never been shy about who she is. However, in the next track of the album, Plastic Doll, she reveals how being herself has left her feeling like a spectacle to the public with an upbeat and jittery production mimicking the snappy movements of a doll.  The remainder of the album's latter half follows the established theme of self-expression and self-love, with Enigma as a stand-out track. Gaga is clearly channeling the exciting funk energy from her 2013 album ARTPOP with groovy instrumentals   and her easily recognizable vocal range on full display in ""Enigma."" The disco beats of the song and mystery in the lyrics ""We could be anything you want""   make it clear that Chromatica is a land of freedom for both identity and dance.   [Related Links:    Album review: The Weeknd authentically portrays heartache over past heartbreak in After Hours   ]   Introducing the final section with yet another interlude, ""Chromatica III,"" Gaga grows from her past and closes out her album with three tracks that modernize her music with impressive synths. Collaborating with Elton John on Sine from Above, the pair vocalize their shared experiences of healing through music, accompanied by striking piano chords and high-pitched house beats. Gaga uses sine as a homophone for sign, referencing sound waves that are shaped like a sine curve, to expertly emphasize music as a grounding source in her life.  As the album begins to conclude, 1000 Doves stands as the   sonically   weakest track of the album. In an attempt to renovate her disco sound, the songs post-chorus falls short as the house beat overshadows Gagas soaring vocals.  However, the final track of the album, Babylon, redeems the closing division and mimics the same '90s energy   from Madonnas Vogue. Her play on words ties the ancient Mesopotamian city to modern day gossip with the similar-sounding phrase babble on. The track sensationally focuses on her battle with toxic rumors and fosters an environment of chaos with saxophone and dance beats to accompany her message.  In its entirety, Chromatica is not only ideal for the dance floor, but it also highlights the fragile and vulnerable side of Gaga's life as a pop star. She returns to the disco beats that established her as the pop diva she is while lyrically exploring her own identity outside of the spotlight.  After postponing the original release date of the album as a result of COVID-19, Chromatica is well worth the wait.",['cap-yasmin-madjidi'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.ladygaga.review.courtesy.jpg

Second-year dance student Roni Nelson was selected to perform their piece, which they said deconstructs Horton technique, a practice that incorporates lateral movements and clearly defined shapes. Nelson said ""Ideas in Action"" serves as an intimate setting to showcase experimental work in a space that feels comfortable.  &nbsp;  (The event) is just a platform for students to show their work, since we don't get many other chances,"" Nelson said. ""It's also good because it's informal, so we can get feedback and work on it.""   [Related:    Four Quartets performance to ponder T.S. Eliots poem through dance, art   ]   Many people who are familiar with Horton technique distance themselves from it because of its rigorous   structure and constraint, but Nelson said their piece challenges   those assumptions by breaking down the patterns to become improvisational. Nelson's solo is an accumulation piece built on the word discipline. After centering their creative mindset on this idea, Nelson said they returned to the assumptions people have about the restrictive nature of Horton technique in order to show the ability to experiment while still following the technique's rules.    To reflect the creative nature of Ideas in Action, this quarter's performers were chosen through video submission by faculty in the world arts and cultures/dance department who felt the pieces were powerful. Fourth-year dance student Jerric Shaw was among those selected to perform. He said he uses the department's   approaches      such as detaching himself from solely using dance as a method of expression      to enhance his own choreographic style in his solo.  [caption id=""attachment_377163"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""714""]    For his piece, Jerric Shaw said he created his own soundtrack and a GarageBand compilation of soundscapes like wind, rain and ocean, FKA Twigs home with you and an Alan Watts spoken word piece ""Let Go. (Esther Li/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  To do so, he created his own soundtrack and drew inspiration from his other works dealing with breathing, texts and soundscapes and combined these elements for his final project. The result is movement that is mostly improvised as well as a GarageBand compilation of soundscapes like wind, rain and ocean, FKA twigs home with you and an Alan Watts spoken word piece titled   ""Let Go of Attachment,"" he said.  I wanted to try something different where the music was following me, as opposed to the dancer following the music, Shaw said. In postmodern views, they dont want you to be seduced by the music.""  To reflect these views in his work, Shaw said he choreographed the movement phrases first and then went to GarageBand to create the sequences of sound to go alongside them. He said using soundtracks that were nonlinear allowed   him   to   experiment with sound and focus on layering so he could choreograph pieces that have artistic intention rather than using meaningless movement.  Third-year dance student Oriana Elizabeth Simon also took an experimental approach with her piece, in which she uses   movement to interrogate the body. She said she created her 25-minute solo under guest choreographer Ligia Lewis, who guided her through the different ways the body can be used for performance.  In Lewis' class, Simon said she was told to pick three cultural objects    for which she chose Beyoncs ""Homecoming: The Live Album,"" the Brazilian film ""Vidas secas""   and hoop earrings  and built around these items' elements of struggle and exhaustion.   To immerse herself in her inspirations, Simon used embodied practice, in which she implemented them into her activities every day until they became a conscious part of her routine.  It was my mission to listen to Beyoncs 'Homecoming' album every day until I realized I couldnt function unless I listened to it, Simon said.  [caption id=""attachment_377164"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""710""]    Oriana Elizabeth Simon said her piece interrogates vulnerability within her own body as she undresses and sings to Beyonces Get Me Bodied, says poetry, reads lines from ""Vidas Secas"" and creates spatial pathways.(Esther Li/Daily Bruin)[/caption]    Lewis' class also introduced Simon to the idea of nudity as an experimental choreographic tool.   After drawing inspiration from a nude work, Simon said she interrogated vulnerability within her own body through her piece. As her clothing is removed, she sings loudly to Beyoncs Get Me Bodied, which only she can hear, reads lines from ""Vidas secas"" and creates spatial pathways.   [Related:    UCLA Dancesport to host Sunset Classic, inviting dancers of all skill levels   ]   She said many of her works subvert traditional storytelling and lack a clear beginning, middle or end.   For ""Ideas in Action,"" Simon will be showing a five-minute excerpt of her work. Simon said she hopes the intimacy of the event will let the audience question her piece and continue thinking about its message after it's over.  The purpose of my work is not to evoke some sort of feeling or some kind of story in the audience,"" Simon said. ""I want them to question what Im doing and still think about the performance after it has ended. I dont have to tell you a story you already know.  Audiences engage with the works by providing feedback on how they perceived the stories, making   ""Ideas in Action"" a conversation between both dancers and audiences. The performance will show people the kinds of works being produced in the department, Simon said. By showcasing works in progress, it also offers dancers the opportunity to continue evolving and improving their experimental pieces.  There is something really special about dance, Simon said.

UCLA mens basketball (19-12, 12-6 Pac-12) fell to crosstown rival USC (22-9, 11-7) 54-52 on Saturday afternoon at the Galen Center, handing the Bruins their first loss since Feb. 6. The loss also locked UCLA in as the No. 2 seed in next weeks Pac-12 tournament.    After allowing the Bruins to take a one-point lead on a pair of free throws from redshirt sophomore forward Cody Riley with nine seconds to play, the Trojans put the ball in the hands of their captain  senior guard Jonah Mathews.    Mathews brought the ball up the floor and had redshirt sophomore forward/center Jalen Hill switched onto him after a high screen. Despite Hill contesting the shot with his 6-foot, 10-inch frame, Mathews rose up and knocked down a stepback 3-pointer with just one second remaining to ice the game.    We knew they were (going to Mathews), Cronin said. We made sure we switched our biggest, most athletic guy on him. Gotta give that guy credit now he made a step-back three over (Hill).    Junior guard Chris Smith was not on the floor for USCs final possession after fouling out a few plays prior. Smith  who might have been the player matched up on Mathews if he hadnt fouled out  said it was just as difficult to see the final shot go in from the bench as it would have been from the floor.    It would have been hard if I was on the court or off the court, Smith said. It didnt matter, we lost.    Entering Saturdays matchup, UCLA hadnt lost a game in which its opponent scored 73 points or less. Despite holding the Trojans to just 41.2 percent shooting from the floor, the Bruins finished the contest at a season-low 31.4 percent.    Mathews and forward Onyeka Okongwu did most of the damage for USC, combining for 35 points on 13-of-25 shooting. Okongwu also scored 14 of the Trojans first 30 points.    Riley said guarding the former McDonalds All-American was a challenge, but nothing out of the ordinary.    He's a big fella, he's a big guy, pretty athletic, Riley said. It was just another challenge, another player I have to guard.    The Bruins held Okongwu to two points in the final 14 minutes, and his two missed free throws, with 27 seconds left, set up UCLAs potential game-winning possession. The Trojans came up empty on that trip, but they still managed to hit six of their final seven shots from the field.    Neither team trailed or led by more than five points for the entire contest.    The Bruins will now turn their attention to the Pac-12 tournament starting Wednesday in Las Vegas.

The Bruins were in Washington just last week when they faced off against their conference rivals at the Pac-12 championship meet, securing a fourth-place finish  their best since 2014.  The Bruins lone Pac-12 individual event winner was junior diver Ruby Neave.  Neave took home first in the 1-meter springboard event  the third consecutive time in which a UCLA diver has taken home the honors at the meet. She finished with a score of 329.30, a season-best. The junior also took home a third in the 3-meter springboard competition with a final score of 334.85.  Neave will travel back to Washington with the hope of securing a spot in the NCAA championships in Athens, Georgia, which will take place later this month.  Apart from Neave, the Bruins also had several other divers qualify for the zones meet this week. Junior Alice Yanovsky, freshman Hannah Butler and freshman Katie Shaheen also qualified with scores from earlier this season.  On the swimming side, three Bruins have already qualified for the NCAA championships. Senior Amy Okada will race in the 200-yard butterfly, senior Kenisha Liu qualified for the 200-yard freestyle and sophomore Claire Grover made it in the 50-yard freestyle.

The board designated a working group to research how to manage NIL rights moving forward in October, and the group made its official proposal to the board Tuesday.    The changes are set to go into effect for the 2021-2022 academic year.    Throughout our efforts to enhance support to college athletes, the NCAA has relied upon considerable feedback from and the engagement of our members, including numerous student-athletes, from all three divisions, said board chair Michael V. Drake in a statement. Allowing promotions and third-party endorsements is uncharted territory.    The NCAA made a commitment to allow NIL monetization in October and said the bylaws would have to be in place by the start of 2021. Group co-chair and Ohio State Athletics Director Gene Smith said the NCAA still plans to adhere to this timeline, and the changes to NIL access will be made no later than January 2021.    California Sen. Nancy Skinner co-authored the Fair Pay to Play Act, or Senate Bill 206, in February 2019. The act would allow California student-athletes to profit off their NIL, and it was eventually signed into law in September and will go into effect in January 2023.    The NCAA will now ask Congress to make a federal law on the matter, so there arent discrepancies on a state-to-state basis moving forward.    The proposed rules would allow student-athletes to sign endorsement deals, so long as their school is not involved with the payment and the contracts are disclosed to each athletic department. Athletes will be allowed to reference their sport and school in advertisements, but they cannot appear with any school logos or branding.    Such bylaws would make it difficult for EA Sports NCAA football and basketball video game series to return to shelves. Working group co-chair Val Ackerman and Big East commissioner said the group licensing required for student-athletes to appear in video games is largely unworkable because collegiate athletes dont have a union or bargaining unit.    NCAA leaders are set to vote on the proposed rules no later than January, but the schedule is flexible and the vote could come sooner.

Growing up, my dinner table was the place where I learned how to argue my ideas, how to use new vocabulary and how to practice good manners. It became the ultimate locus of storytelling and helped me realize that I loved to both narrate stories and to devour them.  However, our family dinners fundamentally changed in 2016 when my brother left for college. Even though the rest of us still ate as a family, the dynamic at the dinner table felt off.  Though it began with my brother's departure, the dinner table was turned on its head once again by my own leaving for UCLA in 2018. While I could avoid dealing with dirty dishes on the Hill, the daily hustle and bustle also meant a lot of take-out and multitasking while eating. Group dinners became hard to coordinate and became more of a special occasion than a nightly ritual.  However, with the onset of COVID-19, a large portion of us have moved back home and have found ourselves in a place we did not think we would be in at this time of year. Suddenly, the possibility and popularity of the family dinner, as well as the benefits it brings and the connections we share as a result of it, have been revived.  Eating dinners with family can be a secure way to  foster togetherness , which   has become   increasingly important as we remain largely isolated from those outside our homes.  This is the case for Sofia Cordoba, a first-year history student, who eats every meal with her family as they adhere to stay-at-home guidelines.  ""At UCLA, what happened was that I was eating more of necessity, for nourishment, but I wasn't sitting down and enjoying my meals,"" Cordoba said. ""Back home I am enjoying sitting down with my family and eating home-cooked meals, while also being able to spend quality time with them, which was not possible in college.""  [caption id=""attachment_380432"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Emily Dembinski/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  While eating as a family can foster quality time, it can also be an excellent way to maintain physical and psychological wellbeing. According to  a study  by Columbia University, children who dine with their parents tend to eat healthier, perform better academically, have fewer problems with substance misuse and have closer relationships with their parents.  Not only can eating together produce health benefits, but it can also facilitate strong personal connections. A  study in the Journal of Consumer Psychology  found that eating similar foods at the same time as someone else can help establish feelings of trust and closeness, even between strangers. It might be evident, then, that the ability to sit down and enjoy food can bring us together.  One place we can see this sentiment in action is  in our cultural traditions .  Many rituals and celebrations that occur all around the world revolve around food. When we celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas, the Fourth of July, Hanukkah, Ramadan and more, we do so with food. In this way, we forge our communities and ritual connections when we sit down to eat a meal together.  Perhaps most relevant at the moment, however, is that food can also benefit us when nobody else is around. According to a  study  published in The Journal of Positive Psychology, researchers found that people who integrated small creative tasks into their everyday life, such as cooking and baking, were more enthusiastic going into the next day. This feeling of enthusiasm can be especially important at a time when, for many, the days seem to blend together.  Additionally, food can alleviate some of our feelings of loneliness as it connects us to those far away. For example, a quick peek at the abundant banana bread pictures on our social media feeds can easily demonstrate the appeal of this idea. Even among Daily Bruin staff, we've created a recipe-sharing Slack channel, helping many of us connect through homemade recipes when we can no longer do so during late-nights at the office.  Despite the second-nature act of sharing food with others, busy-culture has reduced the number of meals we eat together. According to a  study  done by the Emory Center for Myth and Ritual in American Life, less than 33% of American families eat together more than two times per week.   The Atlantic  suggests this drop is not for lack of want, but rather it is an issue of time. With average commute lengths increasing and technology allowing people to bring their work home with them, many people feared that the act of sitting down for a meal was slowly becoming extinct.  However, those fears may now be able to stay just that  fears. In an unlikely reversal, of course, the coronavirus brushed off the dust from our dining tables, reunited loved ones and created a desire for distractions from the outside world that we aim to get from dinnertime discussions.  ""During the morning we talk about the news and all of the disasters that are happening, almost as if to get it out of the way for the rest of the day,"" Cordoba said. ""At night, we avoid coronavirus and talk instead about what we all did during the day including my online classes, my brothers music and my parent's work.""  The effects of COVID-19, however, have also limited the types of discussions that occur at the dinner table.  Leah Carrere, a second-year biochemistry student, said the pandemic has altered the way she spends time with her family.  ""It does feel different than eating dinners at UCLA or dinners before quarantine because there are very few 'How was your day' conversations, which I used to have with my roommates,"" Carrere said. ""We used to do that as a family as well, but since quarantined, we are like, well what is there to talk about, we all did the same thing every day, and we are all together when we did it.""    Nevertheless, to prevent boredom and monotony, our dinner tables have undergone some refashioning and modification to provide a space for innovation.  A  new trend popularized by Tik Tok    has led to families hosting themed   dinners, simulating popular restaurants they can't go to anymore or spicing things up with intricate cuisines  all without leaving their homes. Families have turned to the internet to showcase their dinners in which they dressed up as their favorite Friends character, dished a Hibachi-style dinner or even role-played as different members of the family.  It's the same storytelling that has always existed around the table, but in a completely different fashion.  Even though family dinners will never be as time-efficient as grabbing fast food or getting take-out from The Study at Hedrick, they remain a way for people to feel connected to those around them, and have been crucial to many in a time of extremely reduced social interaction.  In a strange way, the unprecedented situation we are in now has led us to re-embrace the traditions we had previously left behind. And even if we do have to wash dishes after a home-cooked meal consumed with loved ones, at least we can do so while dressed as Carole Baskin.",['cap-veronica-fernandez-de-soto'],"['student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.quad_.dinnerwfamily.ANg_.jpg

I knew I didn&#8217;t want to write, given my major required me to constantly string words together, but I didn&#8217;t know that I could join Copy.   Being in Copy allowed me to read so many stories about campus life and politics, broadening my perspective and knowledge while helping writers get important news out in the best way possible.  Copy is a little misunderstood, but I love it for all its quirks &#8211; especially its people. I have met some of my closest UCLA friends while joking around the Copy desk. If you ask my bosses, they might say I spent more time playing than working. However, that&#8217;s what makes working at a student newspaper so unique: We are coworkers, but we are also friends, peers and classmates.  Quietness or shyness seems to be a defining feature of Copy, but I think we helped turn that around this year. Granted, I have spent three years at the Copy desk trying to contribute to our socialization, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what the future of Copy holds.  I joined Daily Bruin in the fall of my sophomore year at UCLA. I was already pretty well-adjusted, with a job on campus and a Greek house to call &#8220;home.&#8221; However, I felt like I wanted to be involved in something bigger at UCLA, and the Daily Bruin seemed like the perfect place for me to accomplish that.  Quitting Copy, and the Daily Bruin, crossed my mind near the end of every quarter, when my editors would send out their surveys inquiring about my intentions for the next quarter. However, it was a single person, not just the work, who kept me in Copy time after time &#8211; Rayna Salam. Because of Rayna, I made the trek week after week to Kerckhoff Hall 118 to copy edit stories until midnight.  I can finally confess to an already pretty well-known fact: Rayna and I would calculatedly make sure our availability worked in such a way that would guarantee our placement on the same shifts. Thanks for being my accomplice!  Daily Bruin, mostly the Copy desk, has supported me while I went through sleepless nights studying for the LSAT and frantically worked on my hundreds of drafts of personal statements, and even when I&#8217;d pull all-nighters after working at the Covel front desk from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m.  While the work is important and worthwhile, some might even say newsworthy, it&#8217;s the memories that I made with people in the office that I will carry with me. Even when I&#8217;d had a full day of classes, my internship and babysitting, I&#8217;d still get excited to walk all the way from my apartment to Kerckhoff 118 on Westwood&#8217;s dark streets to meet up with my favorite gal pal and engage in our weekly life updates while editing stories and scarfing down Panda Express orange chicken.  I regret not being able to contribute more to the Daily Bruin, but it&#8217;s hard when you&#8217;re working for free! With law school as the goal since day one, most of my energy has been spent on working for standard wages, academics and my internships. Notwithstanding, I showed up every week to copy edit as a sort of volunteer, or as a &#8220;copy contributor,&#8221; to be legit, just because I loved the energy of the office. While editing, we would inevitably get into debates surrounding sensitivity, diction and grammar &#8211; all subjects I could debate until the cows come home. Kerckhoff 118 is a unique place in that sense, one that fosters disagreement and breeds passionate opinions and ideas.  To my closest Daily Bruin friends: I will always fondly remember the nights we spent watching The Bachelor while some of us frantically edited breaking stories or freaking out about corrections that, unfortunately, went unnoticed at the office but came to light while at my room in a fraternity house, our faces illuminated solely by purple LED lights. I&#8217;ll never forget you editing daytime stories in the car ride back from accompanying me to get my first tattoo or editing game coverage while we were cheering for Jaime Jaquez Jr. from the stands in Pauley Pavilion. I have so loved being Sara Hubbard&#8217;s employee &#8211; check my Slack if you think I&#8217;m joking. You all have my heart and have helped define my life as a Bruin.  To my younger Copy babies: Have fun trying to come up with a headline for this string of my thoughts and memories!   Amir was a Copy contributor from 2017-2020.

The Westwood Village Improvement Association planning and mobility committee met with Los Angeles City planning assistant Julia Duncan on March 4 to relay complaints from prospective businesses about storefront signage.   The Westwood Village Specific Plan, a 1989 zoning and regulatory framework, requires exterior signage to gain approval from the director of planning based on a recommendation from the Westwood Community Design Review Board, according to Andrew Thomas, the WVIA executive director. The process is time-consuming and often unfruitful, some business owners said.   The DRB, appointed by city councilmember Paul Koretz, is a group of seven members that ensures local development, beautification and design adhere to the Westwood Community Plan.   Thomas said 39 businesses in the Village have approached the DRB about signage since January 2017. Many of these returned more than once without gaining approval.   &#8220;Westwood is fortunate to have a DRB that oversees our character, our aesthetic and our design, but the requirements to bring signage through the DRB does make the process more time-consuming, more expensive and sometimes unpredictable for our businesses,&#8221; Thomas said.   Some businesses in Westwood, such as Westwood Wireless and Campus Shoe Repair, have resorted to putting up temporary banners. Thomas said that, per the Westwood Village Specific Plan, temporary signs are permitted for up to 60 days.   &#8220;We have a number of these banners that are up in the district that are really replacing signage, possibly in an effort to circumvent the process,&#8221; Thomas said.  WVIA board member Jessica Dabney said the WVIA should consider creating an over-the-counter signage process for the Village that would circumvent the DRB and encourage businesses to open.   An over-the-counter process would entail meeting-prescribed requirements set by city planning staff such as sign size, letter size and lighting. Once the requirements are met, businesses would receive their permits and could put up their signs without going through the DRB.  Similar over-the-counter processes have been adopted elsewhere in Los Angeles. WVIA board member John Heidt said Santa Monica has adopted an over-the-counter process that approved signs with channel letters &#8211; internally illuminated 3D plastic or metal letters &#8211; no larger than 14 inches.  The current signage process can take around three months, Duncan said. Businesses must fill out a geographic referral form and must review the Specific Plan&#8217;s practices and preferences before meeting with the DRB.      Once businesses have completed the package, their signage application will go before the DRB, which notifies businesses of its decision, in two to three weeks, Duncan added.   &#8220;The business community has regularly expressed its frustration to (the WVIA) about the process, the duration of it and cost,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;There are additional delays that regularly come in terms of getting your letters and approval from the planning department, which can stall the process.&#8221;   Jann Williams, chair of the Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association, said the reason for delays in the process could also be due to businesses not familiarizing themselves with the Specific Plan&#8217;s rules and regulations.  &#8220;The issue with signage, very often, was when the applicant came in, they didn&#8217;t have the rules from the Specific Plan,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;If (applicants) would show up to the DRB, with having understood the rules, which I think is really the responsibility of the property owners, ... it would certainly speed up the process.&#8221;   Westwood Village has a vacancy rate of over 20%, which Dabney said would be further exacerbated if there is not an over-the-counter process.  &#8220;This is one of those things that potential tenants have said to me: &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to come to the Village because I heard it can take nine months to put up a sign,&#8217;&#8221; Dabney said. &#8220;We want to fill the Village, but we want the Village to be beautiful.&#8221;    [Related:  Recent restaurant closures in Westwood raise growing concerns of Village&#8217;s vitality ]    Thomas also attributed the difficult business climate to the amount of appeals that have been filed against businesses. Two-thirds of these appeals have been directed by three individuals who he thinks may be partly responsible for Westwood&#8217;s vacancy rate and business stagnation.    [Related:  Document shows three people account for majority of property appeals in Westwood ]   &#8220;Businesses don&#8217;t operate in a vacuum,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;They talk to each other. It&#8217;s a problem for Westwood Village when current businesses talk to potential businesses and tell the potential businesses about the struggle to open in the district.&#8221;   If an over-the-counter process were to be in the works, Duncan said the process would have to be part of a Specific Plan amendment.  The WVIA will further discuss adding the over-the-counter amendment recommendation to already agendized amendments during its board meeting March 19.

The association meets for forum every three weeks and takes positions on current issues affecting graduate students. Forum meetings are at 5:30 p.m. and are open to all students. Spring quarter forum meetings will take place virtually on Zoom.    Agenda:    The association allocated a total of $33,172.33 from Cabinet Discretionary, Forum Discretionary, Travel, Presidential Discretionary, Sustainable Resource Center and Graduate Student Events Discretionary to the GSA Hardship Fund. The GSA Hardship Fund awards up to $700 to graduate students in emergency situations, including hardships due to the coronavirus outbreak.    About $25,000 has been approved for GSA Hardship Fund awards, said Eddie Delgadillo, a representative for the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. Delgadillo sits on the GSA committee that evaluates applications for the fund.    Elections Board Director Arpita Iddya announced the results of the spring GSA election which ended on April 13. Jean Paul Santos will be president, Musibau Francis Jimoh will be vice president of internal affairs, Neda Ashtari will be the vice president of external affairs and Letty Trevino will be the vice president of academic affairs. The candidate-elects will take the oath of office at the next forum meeting, Iddya said. Iddya also said that the BruinGo Universal Access Transit Pass Referendum passed. The referendum will increase graduate student fees by $25.04 per quarter and give graduate students access to seven local transit systems, including Los Angeles Metro, Culver City Bus, Big Blue Bus, Long Beach Transit, Antelope Valley Transit Authority, Torrance Transit and Los Angeles Department of Transportation Commuter Express.     GSA Student Interest Board member Letty Trevino said that graduate students who were formally offered a position as a teaching assistant have union contract protections even if their class is canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak. Graduate students may be guaranteed the position or receive an equal stipend in such cases.      Officer Reports:    President Zak Fisher said his office discussed the possibility of a spring quarter tuition refund with Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck. Beck said there will not be a tuition refund due to increased costs in computers and microphones for online learning, Fisher said. Fisher added that he thinks student service fee and other fees should be refunded because they cannot be used for their original purpose on campus.     Vice President of External Affairs Jean Paul Santos said his office will meet with UCLA Housing officials to discuss university housing options for graduate students in light of the coronavirus outbreak. Santos also said his office will meet with UCLA administration to discuss graduate student academic problems. Santos added that his office will work with the candidate-elect Neda Ashtari to lobby to the University of California Board of Regents for a tuition refund.     Vice President of Academic Affairs Shrinidhi Balasubramanian said her office is collecting information about academic disputes between graduate students and professors.

Continuing to follow the trend of pushing the limits, its fourth studio record Notes On A Conditional Form walks the line between sonic originality and the   classic UK garage rock the group has been known for since its 2013 debut. But on this newest release, the quartet  led by singer and primary lyricist Matty Healy  grounds listeners in the unequivocal, yet old-school, importance of listening to an album holistically. Each of its 22 tracks meticulously trace a path from ballads to borderline post-hardcore to hip-hop and house music, stretching far outside of   the synth-heavy sound the band was established on.  What could easily be written off as a laborious listen masterfully guides an unpredictable tracklist full of seamless genre shifts. Even from the start, the bands album staple  but never identical  opening track The 1975 fuses soft chimes with a climate change-focused speech by activist Greta Thunberg. The track's insistent tone effortlessly bleeds into Healy's rowdy vocals and screeching electric guitars in the   second track People.  Early on, it's   the record's   track order that gives the listener room to breathe. Healy, a mastermind of bridging songs sonically and lyrically, brings together seemingly disparate tracks.   I    t is no mistake that the quiet strength of Thunbergs It is time to rebel presages Healys desperate pleas for older generations to believe that the young surprise people in The 1975s grungiest track yet.   [Related Links:    Album review: The 1975s new album explores personal struggles, offers comfort to listener   ]   As it progresses, Notes On A Conditional Form is   an expedition of Healys confused romantic relationships, his distaste for screen-heavy society and his frazzled mental state. But the   mostly instrumental tracks peppered throughout  Streaming, I Think Theres Something You Should Know and Shiny Collarbone  provide a welcome road map for the bands ambitious genre experimentation.  The bulk of the instrumental interludes follow a similar structure of swelling strings aided by smooth and twinkling synths, crafted largely by the bands drummer and producer George Daniel. But those in   the albums second half toy with a   reliance on computer-generated drums and auto-tuned vocals that   become their own instrument, hinting at a shift in genre.  Streaming provides an uninterrupted transfer into the equally smooth chimes and kick drum of The Birthday Party's winding storytelling. Meanwhile, the morphed take on beat-driven house music in Shiny Collarbone acts as a place marker for the end of the   bands stint on hip-hop tracks.   The song, in tandem with I Think Theres Something You Should Know, effectively bookends the most starkly atypical The 1975 songs: the hip-hop-verging tracks Nothing Revealed / Everything Denied and Tonight (I Wish I Was Your Boy). These transitions allow Healy to test his hand at genre-bending while tactfully categorizing the nearly 90-minute album.  Taking his chance on genre-bending tracks, the singer astonishingly ventures   into acoustic dad folk rock in the 10th track ""Roadkill.""   In his own twist on twangy guitar notes usually reserved for careful, tiptoeing country lyrics, Healy instead substitutes edgy but dreary lyrics about sex, drug addiction and American judgment of his glitzy British rock star persona.     While singing over a notably American country-style beat, Healy comically acknowledges that even though his songs have reached radio popularity, Americans are still ""mugging (him) off all across the nation.""   [Related Links:    Album review: Tame Impala blends past and future in highly anticipated fourth album   ]   But nostalgic moments dont get lost in the albums dynamic shifts. While track order helps listeners follow the otherwise whiplash-inducing change among hip-hop, screamo and house music, it also allows the band to revisit its garage rock roots. The records tender lyrical   moments are exemplified in sonic callbacks to the mid-2000s when The 1975 was a group of plucky punk rockers operating under the name Drive Like I Do.  A warm electric guitar progression and yearning romantic lyrics in Me &amp; You Together Song represent a classic sentimental sound for the group members who have been together since their early teens  a perfect soundtrack for devoted listeners who have been In love with (them) for ages. The 16th track If Youre Too Shy (Let Me Know) achieves a similar sonic feat, but it cleverly roots itself in modernity   with its technology-driven love story of a man and a woman who he sees ""online all the time.  After a heartwarming blast from the past sprinkled with a soundscape from the present, listeners who follow the track order are rewarded with Healys own sentimentality. This time its purely for himself rather than the coy nostalgia his fans crave. The singer duets with his father on the sweet piano track Dont Worry  from his childhood . The lullaby of a track takes a step back from the serious themes woven through the record and humanizes the rockstar Healy has made himself out to be.  Taking that a step further, closing track Guys is an emotive love letter from Healy to his bandmates. There isnt an inking of cheesiness in the songs intention. Rather, The 1975 sidesteps the rock stigma which often stops lyricists from writing a love story beyond the realm of romance.  In the concluding song, The 1975 may be the best thing that ever happened to Healy, but the bands committed undertaking to find a newfangled take on a tired genre makes it pretty special for listeners around the world too.",['cap-brooke-cuzick'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.ae_.noacf_.review.courtesy.jpg

Safe to say, this school year has been a wild ride.  Even though we are finishing the year right when the academic calendar predicted, no one would have imagined we would end it quite like this. We as a student body have experienced many new challenges since arriving on campus in September, and in turn, there is a sense of accomplishment just from getting through these nine crazy months. Taking a look back might be what we need to fully accept the things that happened this school year, and to appreciate what we have lost and learned.  Getty fire  One of our most-read news stories this year was    our coverage of the Getty fir  e.   On Oct. 28 at around 1:30 a.m., a fire started about 2 miles from UCLA, on the other side of the 405 Freeway. In the next three days, the fire spread 745 acres and was met with the response of around 619 firefighter personnel.  [caption caption=""(Aileen Nguyen/Daily Bruin senior staff)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385418"" width=""859""]   [/caption]   The effects of the fire on students included heightened concerns about air quality, power outages and the inability to commute because of the closure of some parts of the 405 Freeway.  Understandably, students were alarmed and looked to the UCLA administration to provide guidance, especially with the fire being visible from dorm windows. Unfortunately, the  response from UCLA was deemed untimely by many students .   While UCLA did cancel all classes around 9:25 a.m. on the day the fire broke out, this announcement came late in some students' opinions.   Daniel Gomez, a second-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student,   had a rude awakening that Monday morning after seeing reports that the 405 Freeway and exits toward UCLA were closed. To Gomez, the notification from UCLA about class cancellations came late in comparison to the California Highway Patrol's report.  In light of all of this, students sent a letter to the Academic Senate to call for classes to be canceled until the fire was contained. However, classes resumed the next day, when containment was only at 5%.  COLA strike  In December, graduate students at UC Santa Cruz started a union-unapproved strike for better wages as part of a cost-of-living adjustment, also known as COLA.  Then, when the first strike failed to produce the desired results, a second strike began Feb. 10. This time, teaching assistants refused to teach, grade or hold office hours until demands were met.  In response, UCSC announced that it would provide a housing supplement of $2,500 to Master of Fine Arts and doctoral students, but only if the teaching assistants returned to work. However, 54 TAs were fired Feb. 28 by the University of California Office of the President for continuing to withhold grades.  While UCLA graduate students supporting cost-of-living adjustments have rallied several times at UCLA before, the  Ucla4Cola organization  decided to   organize   a strike  in solidarity with the 54   UCSC graduate students who were fired and the additional 28 graduate students who were given notices that they would not be considered for spring teaching positions.  On March 5, Ucla4Cola rallied at Janss Steps and   almost 100 graduate students  voted to go on strike  the following week, but only if graduate students in at least 10 departments approved.  [caption caption=""(Lauren Man/Assistant Photo editor)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385419"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   In an  op-ed by a Ucla4Cola member , the actions UCLA graduate students took in response to the events at UCSC were described, such as organizing a Student Solidarity Week for undergraduates to show their support. Ucla4Cola members also practiced civil disobedience by not swiping into Covel Commons Residential Restaurant in order to highlight the issue of food insecurity on campus.   Online spring quarter    The most defining event of the 2019-2020 year, to say the least, was the COVID-19 pandemic and the  historic remote spring quarter  that came as a consequence of it.  On March 13, UCLA made the announcement that classes would be online through the end of spring quarter. Previously, it had declared a suspension of in-person classes only until April 10. But, by the time the second email was sent, the possibility of continuing spring quarter on campus was no longer viable.  In the emailed statement by Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Emily Carter, Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck and Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Monroe Gorden Jr., students were encouraged to pack their belongings and move back home, though on-campus housing would still be open for the rest of the quarter. Students who chose to stay on campus could only receive takeout boxes from dining halls, and some were placed into different dorms to better meet social distancing guidelines.  Those who moved back home received a housing refund. When it came to tuition, however, students were met with less sympathy.  Considering the obvious absence or reduction of campus programs and functions, many students called on the  UC system to consider a partial refund  for the cost of attendance. A Change.org petition was created, arguing that the majority of students had returned home and were no longer able to benefit from campus services. It amassed more than 43,000 signatures.  Unfortunately, the broader UC and UCLA continued to reject any possibility of a tuition cut. UC spokesperson Sarah McBride said the transition to online learning has led to higher costs; for example, the website licenses to run software like Zoom, technology security and laptops come at a price.  In response to the UC's refusal to adjust tuition, the Undergraduate Students Association Council argued that the UC administration had not been transparent enough about the reasons for its decision. USAC also stressed the extremely high cost for out-of-state students for an education that was no longer out-of-state, but rather from their own homes.  And on a sadder note for graduating seniors, the remote quarter meant  remote   graduation   ceremonies  .   Chancellor Gene Block announced in an emailed statement that all spring campus graduation ceremonies would be conducted virtually in an effort to combat the spread of COVID-19. Block's announcement joined countless others from universities across the world, as 2020  seniors grappled with the sorrow  of not being able to celebrate with friends and family on the campus they called home.  Goodbye to Stan's Donuts  April 9 will forever be known as the day  Stan Berman made his last donut .  Originally opened as The Corner Shoppe in 1965, Stan's Donuts brought sweet treats to UCLA students, Westwood villagers and tourists alike for 55 years. It was a fan favorite among students and a classic establishment in the Los Angeles community.  [caption caption=""(Daily Bruin file photo)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385420"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   But after all of these years, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic put an end to this legendary shop. When restaurants and nonessential businesses were forced to temporarily close per the orders of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, it seemed like the right time for Berman to close up shop for good.  &#8220;Unfortunately COVID-19 made the decision happen sooner, but I hope that you will remember how our donuts made you smile for many years to come,"" Berman said in a statement on the store's website.  Black Lives Matter protests  On May 25, George Floyd died in police custody after a Minneapolis police officer, in the presence of three other officers, pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. One day later, soon-to-be nationwide protests for Black rights and against police brutality, all in the larger context of the Black Lives Matter movement, began.  [caption caption=""(Axel Lopex/Daily Bruin senior staff)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385421"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]  One of the first Los Angeles protests in the wake of the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor began as a peaceful  protest against police brutality at Pan Pacific Park  on May 30. The protest eventually turned violent as protestors were met with police. Protestors set fire to at least two police cars and broke the windows of other police cars, while officers fired rubber bullets and released tear gas into the crowd.  Garcetti  issued a curfew  from 8 p.m. on May 30 to 5:30 a.m. on May 31, citing the need to uphold the safety of demonstrators, law enforcement and LA citizens. Garcetti also requested 500-700  National Guard troops  from Gov. Newsom to maintain safety, despite stating in a press conference earlier that day that he would not do so. At around 8:30 p.m., Garcetti announced that the California National Guard was being deployed.  Both Newsom and LA County Board of Supervisors chair Kathryn Barger went on to proclaim states of emergency; in a similar vein, LA County officials continued to enforce curfews over the next four nights.  After May 30, protests organized by both city-based and UCLA-based organizations continued in Westwood.  The Student Activist Project at UCLA planned a protest in Westwood on June 1   but had to cancel for numerous reasons, including the fact that the organizers did not consult the Afrikan Student Union or the Black Graduate Student Association in their initial planning. Nonetheless, protestors still showed up and gathered near the Wilshire Federal Building that day.  On June 1, dozens of protestors from across the city, including   some college students, were  detained in the parking lot of Jackie Robinson Stadium . Handcuffed in cages within buses, the detainees were held without access to food, water or bathrooms.   Many people condemned UCLA for allowing LAPD to utilize the property, leading UCLA officials to release a statement June 3 that explained that the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs owns the property and gave permission to LAPD. However, the statement said UCLA was aware of LAPD's use of the stadium as a staging area and failed to stop it.  On June 4, BGSA and ASU  organized a protest on campus . The organizations demanded that the UC postpone or modify final exams, fully fund a Black Resource Center at UCLA and divest from UCPD. The UCLA Academic Senate released a statement June 3 recommending that professors make adjustments to finals but stated that they did not have the authority to make direct campuswide changes.  [caption caption=""(MacKenzie Coffman/Daily Bruin senior staff)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_385422"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]  About one week after the initial Westwood protest, hundreds gathered at the Wilshire Federal Building on June 6 for a protest organized by The Islamic Circle of North America Council for Social Justice.   After more than a week of protests, Garcetti announced June 7 that the National Guard would depart that evening, with a small number of troops left until June 10 in case of emergency.

These colorful lollipops, which serve as the film's most attention-grabbing prop, offer the audience a clue to the mystery that permeates the otherwise fantastical world of ""Dream Lollipops."" Zhang's   new short film revolves around 15-year-old Su and her mother Yanying, who inadvertently becomes involved in the drug trade when she begins painting lollipops with drugged pigments, unknowingly delivering them to someone involved in the drug trade every day.  The graduate student said her   film will utilize an apartment set built from scratch in Melnitz Hall to create a mysterious and magical world in which Su is sheltered from wartime by her mother. Rather than rent a real apartment in Los Angeles to shoot in,   Zhang quickly realized building her own set would allow for her to craft the specific vision required for her story. Inspired by 1940s Shanghai but set in an imaginary city, the set needed to capture both the whimsy and the darkness that make up Su&#8217;s world. Zhang said the film's mood is meant to capture the time in one's life when they must leave behind fairy tales in order to face reality.  &#8220;It looks like a fantasy at first, but then you realize it&#8217;s actually a dark comedy,&#8221; Zhang said. &#8220;We wanted the apartment to have this magical feeling that&#8217;s separate from what&#8217;s really going on in the outside world, which is the war.&#8221;   [Related:    Student short film explores unifying desperation of waiting in line for the bathroom   ]   Zhang relied on producer and graduate student Selena Leoni to secure the construction materials needed to craft the isolated, yet magical world.   Leoni said the production design needed to subtly   reflect the fantastical side of the story without going over budget, such as pairing green and purple instead of more complementary colors. Much of the apartment was made of recycled production set materials, and she said they borrowed furniture from places such as the theater department&#8217;s prop house in the interest of maximizing the film&#8217;s budget.  &#8220;We learned a lot about the time that it takes to build everything,&#8221; Leoni said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do everything by yourself, so you have to calculate the time and people you need.&#8221;  With fewer than 10 people working on the art team, communication between the various crew members was essential in order to maximize productivity, Leoni said. Because of the small scale of the crew, Leoni said   a lot of the physical labor fell on Beibei Hu, a graduate student and production designer. Hu said the experience was much different from other shoots where she simply had to choose a location and design the set dressing.  In addition to designing the color palette and doing a majority of the set construction, Hu said she also worked on balancing the film&#8217;s budget with the creative potential of the story. Since Su has been sheltered from the scariness of the world outside, the apartment had to reflect her whimsical worldview, she said.   [caption caption=""Inspired by 1940s Shanghai, the set features a green and purple color palette to bring a mysterious atmosphere, and features a number of colorful lollipops on the walls.

It is also decorated with   colorful artworks of lollipops on the walls, which Hu said are meant to reflect Su&#8217;s love of painting and her fascination with her mother's work. From the detailed lollipops and paintings to the larger set itself, Hu said her role involved a lot of hands-on work.  &#8220;I built a part of the apartment by myself because we needed to control the budget,&#8221; Hu said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to spend so much money on the construction materials, but actually it took about 60% of the cost for our whole budget.&#8221;   [Related:    UCLA alumna uses green screens, CGI in short film to spotlight superficiality in dating   ]   Even after construction on the apartment and props had been completed, other members of the film crew had to work around the challenges presented by the set. Graduate student and cinematographer Hansuk Sohn said he had to grapple with how to maneuver camera equipment within the confines of this enclosed apartment set.  ""(The space within the set) was rather limited,&#8221; Sohn said. &#8220;Sometimes we had to really get into the corner to get the frame that I wanted.&#8221;  Sohn said he requested specific pieces of equipment, such as a wider focus-pulling device, so the first camera assistant could pull focus while watching on a monitor rather than joining Sohn in the small set. Having complete control over the lighting also was a bonus for Sohn, who said it was easier to manipulate in contrast to the unpredictable nature of lighting an outdoor shoot.   Zhang said the shoot itself was easier than she anticipated despite the unique challenges the set presented. Once construction on the set was completed, the shoot ran smoothly and members of the production team like Leoni remained on set to solve any problems that arose. Zhang said despite the time constraints on set, all of the crew remained focused on their assigned roles, pulling everything together before filming began.  &#8220;Maybe five days before the shoot, we hadn&#8217;t really finished building the doors and the walls, and the apartment was all empty,&#8221; Zhang said. &#8220;But eventually, fortunately and magically, it all worked out.&#8221; ",[],"['arts-entertainment', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ae_.dreamlollipops.picA_.jpg

But luckily, sometimes your friends see your talents when you don&#8217;t.  Kristie-Valerie Hoang gave me one of the best opportunities of my life by asking me to apply for Graphics editor after seeing some of the work I&#8217;d done before.  I hated my art before. But after this year, with all the support from the staff, fellow editors &#8211; and the occasional Instagram commenter &#8211; I was able to find confidence in it. Because of you all, I can look at jobs I never thought I could apply to &#8211; you gave me the confidence and experience I needed.  And even the smaller things, from answering Slack messages at Rocco&#8217;s to setting a daily reminder about daytime, Daily Bruin gave me structure in my life again. Talking about upcoming projects was the first time in a while that I felt passionate about something. And the hangouts on my roof will still be some of my favorite memories.  But my biggest thank you goes to the Graphics department. I know it was difficult to have an outsider come in as the top editor. From my not knowing what was going on to implementing major changes, you guys were the best and worked with me through it. Thank you for putting your trust in me, and while I know this was a transitional year, we still emerged a better department. I made many mistakes but at least I had one accomplishment: hiring Ben Brill as an intern. I&#8217;m so excited for you guys next year with him as your top editor. You guys will accomplish great things and I can&#8217;t want to see them.  COVID-19 has made my post-graduation plans uncertain, but, thanks to the Daily Bruin, I&#8217;ll be leaving confident enough to pursue something I love.  I know I&#8217;m late, but I&#8217;ll forever be grateful.   Nguyen was a designer 2017-2019 and Graphics editor from 2019-2020.

No. 20 UCLA rowing (1-0) defeated San Diego State (0-1) on Saturday in Marina Del Rey. This marks the second year in a row in which the Bruins have defeated the Aztecs in their season opener at the Marina Aquatic Center.  UCLA swept every race versus San Diego State, winning all four competitions that took place.  The Bruins' varsity eight narrowly defeated the Aztecs' boat, finishing 1.40 seconds before their opponents. UCLA came in at 6:42.50, while San Diego State finished within a boat's length at 6:43.90.  ""We have three freshmen in the (varsity eight), and quite a few freshmen in the (second varsity eight), so we're a very young team,"" said coach Amy Fuller Kearney. ""We're just starting to get a feel for each other. I thought today was a great start.""  The rest of the races finished with larger gaps between the teams.  UCLA's second varsity eight finished in 6:59.20, over six seconds before San Diego State's did. The third varsity eight race also recorded a six-second-plus margin of victory, with the Bruins coming in at 7:13.20.  The varsity four race was much closer, as the Bruins finished at 7:53.40 to the Aztecs' 7:56.60.  UCLA also raced its fourth varsity eight team to no opponent. Its time was 7:35.80.  ""All the boats got open water on SDSU so it was good. I think it's good having new people, new dynamic,"" said starboard sophomore Lucy Holgate.  UCLA's opener was presented as the Centennial Regatta, and attracted many alumni and other supporters who came out and cheered the team on, something Holgate said gave the Bruins a boost of energy.  ""It's always nice having all the alumni here,"" Holgate said.  Fuller Kearney was honored at the end of the meet for her history with the program and her fight against breast cancer. She was appointed as head coach in 2001 for UCLA's inaugural rowing season as an NCAA program.  ""I have always felt so fortunate to be a part of the UCLA community  I know how special it is,"" Fuller Kearney said. ""It's super meaningful and it's been fun to see the great turnout.""  UCLA will host its final regatta of the season Saturday as the team faces off against Loyola Marymount before going on the road for the remainder of the year.  Last season, the Bruins' first two competitions were also against the Aztecs followed by the Lions. They defeated both opponents and will have a chance to begin the new campaign the same way.",['cap-roland-houseman'],"['rowing', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.rowing.DLB_.jpg

You guys are doing amazing! Jade Gullery said, crouching down to make her face visible.  Gullery, a third-year communication student and member of the UCLA Campus Events Commission, uses the videoconferencing tool Zoom to lead virtual yoga sculpt classes on Wednesdays and Sundays.  Yoga sculpt combines yoga with strength training and cardio exercises to achieve a higher-intensity workout. It typically requires a yoga mat and weights, but Gullery encourages attendees to find substitutes for traditional equipment, such as soup cans.  A number of the Zoom class attendees are familiar with yoga sculpt classes from CorePower, a yoga studio company, and find the CECs version an inexpensive alternative during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gullery said.  At the beginning of each class, Gullery introduces an intention for the day, such as gratitude or self-love and asks attendees to keep it in mind as they go through the workout.  Movements often complement the days intention. For example, Gullery might add extra air punching and cardio sets to emphasize empowerment, she said.  Gullery guides attendees through the positions and exercises and suggests people keep their cameras on so she can give feedback and enhance the feeling of community.  I was nervous about a lack of community, Gullery said. Although its not the same (as an in-person workout class), ... seeing a group of people together and moving, even if its in tiny little rectangles on my screen, ... I think you can still cultivate that feeling.  The class is a great way to switch things up under the circumstances, said Maya Ebrahimpour, a third-year communication and international development studies student.  I think its hard for a virtual class to be the same as an in-person class, Ebrahimpour said. This class is a close second. ... Jade can see us through the screen, watch us, make corrections, and I still get a great workout.  Anna Cosmin-Spanoche, a first-year aerospace engineering student, initially found the yoga sculpt classes through the CECs Instagram page and attended the first class, which had a special themed playlist: Tik Tok Bangers.  Each Sunday, classes have playlists centered around themes like middle school throwbacks or 70s and 80s music.  Though the movements can be difficult, Cosmin-Spanoche said she kept attending the weekly classes because she enjoyed Gullerys energy and choice of music.  Brice McKeown, a third-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student who regularly attends Gullerys classes, likes how she makes attendees feel welcome, even if they choose to leave their camera off during the class.  I know there are a lot of people who feel uncomfortable being in front of other people, ... but on Zoom you can just turn off your camera, McKeown said. (Gullery) will make commentary to people she knows on the call, but she always says she is proud of everyone that has their camera off.  Gullery was certified as a yoga instructor with CorePower and began teaching in-person yoga sculpt classes a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic. She continued to practice yoga in her apartment with her roommates when Los Angeles first implemented  stay-at-home orders  in mid-March.  One of her roommates, the 2020-2021 Campus Events Commissioner Alice Naland, noticed her dedication to yoga and suggested Gullery lead her own classes through CEC.  I was super nervous at first because I had just gotten used to (teaching classes) in person, and the idea of being on video is daunting, Gullery said. Once I started easing into it, I got way more comfortable. I still get nervous, but everyone is super understanding since this is such a novel situation for everyone.  Gullerys yoga sculpt classes are a break from CECs usual programming, said Tara Steinmetz, the 2019-2020 Campus Events commissioner.  The commission typically focuses on bigger events like guest speakers and concerts, but with most people away from campus, CEC wanted to help students feel connected to UCLA, said Steinmetz, a fourth-year French language and literature and global studies student.  The yoga sculpt classes could help students with overall mental health, even providing structure and something to look forward to each week, Steinmetz said.  Since her first year of college, yoga at CorePower has been both a stress-relieving and social activity, Gullery said. She added these classes have allowed her to maintain a sense of calmness and community during the pandemic.  I still feel connected to UCLA through this because it's through CEC, she said. I feel like it's a way of bringing everyone together and working out which is just always great.",['cap-maddie-mcdonagh'],['a-closer-look'],https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/web.news_.zoomyoga.SJ_.jpg

Somehow, his entire college experience was supposed to fit into a small FedEx box.  My family and I attended   his virtual graduation ceremony in our pajamas, not remembering the last time we dressed up. We   clapped as my brother's name rolled by on our living room TV screen. When all was said and done, our makeshift living room graduation had only lasted 30 minutes &#8211; an ephemeral end to one chapter of my brother's life and an uncertain beginning to the next.  Like my brother's school, the College of Letters and Science at UCLA held   a  v  irtual commencement ceremony  June 12 for the graduating Class of 2020. But for now, a Pauley Pavilion full of  families and friends still remains a dream, a relic of years past.     I once thought that by this time, I would be on a plane to New York City to celebrate my brother's graduation. But though things didn't work out that way, I'm not alone in my upended plans &#8211;   the COVID-19 pandemic has left thousands of graduating Bruins and their loved ones with canceled celebrations and at-home alternatives.  For alumna Diana Tejeda, her canceled plans included not only a Pauley Pavilion celebration, but also a post-graduation trip.   ""Initially, before COVID-19, my parents and brothers were going to fly to Los Angeles, and we were going to have a graduation party,"" Tejeda said. ""After, we had a trip to Hawaii planned as a gift.""  [embed url=""https://youtu.be/04BRP0WZxLI"" contenteditable=""false"" uuid=""025cac8d84cf42af93aeb666bd117d60"" provider=""YouTube""]https://youtu.be/04BRP0WZxLI[/embed]   For Bruins whose family members live out-of-state or abroad, a postponed graduation has also meant abandoned visa applications, plane tickets and hotel reservations.  Alumna Esmeralda Villavicencio said several weeks ago that she would be celebrating her hard-earned achievement   by herself in her Westwood apartment after her mom, who lives in Ecuador, could no longer make the trip because of travel restrictions .    ""My mom had only applied for her visa to come to my graduation, and my brother, who lives in Canada, was also planning to come,"" Villavicencio said. ""We were planning to celebrate (with) just the three of us.""  Unfortunately, the pandemic threw a wrench into many Bruins' family reunions and graduation celebrations. However, while some elements of this special occasion have been changed, classic UCLA graduation rituals, like touching the inverted fountain and having photoshoots, still live on.  Accordingly, alumna Elisa Ciappi's last days in Westwood were a race against time &#8211; a final effort to complete these senior rituals.  ""I had to move out of my apartment in two days, completely, and then I realized that I don't even have a picture outside of Royce,"" Ciappi said. ""We rushed with a group of friends to Royce and found a UCLA 2020 sash. I put it on, and they took some pictures of me with an iPhone. Then, we ran to the inverted fountain and found it dry, and it was like, are you kidding me?""  [embed url=""https://youtu.be/vQ8aZKFeC7M"" contenteditable=""false"" uuid=""a7998475c530463da7f39786371f51aa"" provider=""YouTube""]https://youtu.be/vQ8aZKFeC7M[/embed]   Sure, plans get canceled, graduation ceremonies are postponed and fountains run dry. Still, Ciappi's desire to get closure by keeping UCLA traditions alive demonstrates the idea that graduation might be more than just a physical, in-person ceremony.  In fact, the sheer number of virtual ceremonies, podcasts and celebrity commencement speeches that happened this year proves that everyone was determined to celebrate the Class of 2020 in one way or another. In addition to university-sponsored virtual commencements, online platforms like Facebook, YouTube and iHeartRadio made significant efforts to make this year's graduating class feel as special as ever.  YouTube's  Dear Class of 2020 ,     featuring Barack and Michelle Obama, celebrated the achievements of college and high school graduates around the country through a collection of various performances and speeches from celebrities and activists, as well as messages of support for teachers and families. iHeartRadio curated a podcast of s peeches for the Class of 2020  &#8211; giving graduates the unique ability to choose between the wise words of DJ Khaled or the handy advice of Bill and Melinda Gates, to name a few. Finally, Facebook's graduation ceremony included a  commencement address  by Oprah Winfrey in which she asked graduates to think about their essential service to the world.   However, though it will surely be an interesting story to tell in the future, having a celebrity such as Kesha congratulate you on your graduation might not completely make up for lost experiences. Nonetheless, departing Bruins can still find a silver lining to this unconventional situation.   For example, Villavicencio said that she appreciated the fact that a virtual graduation removes some barriers to loved ones witnessing her graduation, such as booking travel plans or finding enough tickets for the ceremony.   ""One of the advantages is that I could send the link to those who could not attend the ceremony before because of traveling or tickets, and they can now attend the graduation,"" Villavicencio said.  [embed url=""https://youtu.be/s8OAjLizYs4"" contenteditable=""false"" uuid=""b01709d0e9244bad85aa2359bb4d4352"" provider=""YouTube""]https://youtu.be/s8OAjLizYs4[/embed]   While Zoom watch parties were on the menu for some, other homebound Bruins celebrated their graduation with their neighbors and families.   For alumna Mariana Gonzalez, graduation at home meant celebrating with those who have been closest to her for most of her life.  ""The silver lining is that I can now celebrate my graduation with more people,"" Gonzalez said. ""I can now celebrate with a lot of my family friends who I grew up with in Houston. If it were in LA, I would have only been with my family.""   These ideas seem to echo a recurring paradox of this pandemic &#8211; the more we are required to isolate, the more we seem to find ways to create community.  But, however you chose to celebrate, I hope you remembered to document it. After all, resilience is the Class of 2020's middle name, and that alone is cause for celebration.    Appropriately, Gonzalez's special day had its fair share of photographic evidence.  ""It is still going to be a significant day regardless, so I still took a bunch of pictures with my family and with the people that are going to be here with me,"" Gonzalez said. ""Pictures and videos are still the best ways to keep those memories alive.""   It's a strange ending, sure. But commencement, as the name suggests, is actually about beginnings. It is important for graduating Bruins not only to recognize the things they've accomplished thus far, but also to be ready to welcome the future, knowing that the rest of us fellow Bruins are celebrating alongside them.  And with that, there's only one &#8211; all right, two &#8211; things left to do: throw the cap, and cue the 8-clap.

The line at Ackerman Union grew throughout the day as students went to vote after classes. Nearby voting centers at Warner Avenue Elementary School  about a 15-minute walk from UCLA  and the Hammer Museum in Westwood, also saw lines multiple hours long at some points in the day, according to several poll workers.    At Ackerman Union, some students registered to vote, others changed their addresses on their registrations, some dropped off their absentee ballots, some ate pizza and all, eventually, voted .   Except for those who didnt. One poll worker estimated more than 20 students left the polls over the course of a single hour because of the lines.    As polls closed at 8 p.m., lines still stretched hours long.    California implemented same-day voter registration this year. Many of the people in line were registering or using the new policy to change their addresses on their registration form, said Maxine Dalton, a volunteer helping with line management and get out the vote efforts for   the California Public Interest Research Group at UCLA   and   a first-year applied mathematics and economics student.        Voting machines in Ackerman Union went down early in the day and had to issue provisional ballots, but eventually the machines began working again, said Joshua Avila, co-director at BruinsVOTE! and a third-year political science student. The voting system at Warner Avenue Elementary School also crashed.    Despite it all, many students ultimately cast their ballots in Ackerman Grand Ballroom.    Some students were driven by a sense of civic duty. Others decided to vote because others couldnt.    Miranda Le, a second-year human biology and society student, said she voted on behalf of those who are not able to cast their own ballots, such as undocumented immigrants.    I feel like it is my civic duty as an American to vote, and I just want a better future for everyone in the country, not just the upper 1%, Le said.    Friends played a part in the decision, as did social media. For example, seeing promotions and reminders about Super Tuesday everywhere motivated Hannah MacKenzie, a first-year biology student, to vote.    A lot of my friends have been posting for almost weeks now, said Andy Goh, a first-year computer science student. Today, theyre like, Oh, my God, go out and vote, go out and vote. And Im like, All right, you know what, since Im registered and all.    Several students said they voted because their teaching assistants were offering them extra credit.    Visitors from outside campus arrived to raise students spirits and keep them at the polls. Heather Matarazzo, known for her role in The Princess Diaries, handed out water to students in line.    The poll workers didnt expect the long lines. More than 20 students left the polls over the course of a single hour because of the lines, one poll worker said.    Josie Thorp, a second-year biology student, said she attempted to vote at Ackerman Grand Ballroom twice Tuesday.    Thorp had first tried to vote earlier in the day at 5 p.m. and waited for an hour, but then decided to go to the   Warner Avenue Elementary School   polling center, which she was told had shorter lines. She had a work shift at 8 p.m., she said.    However, after a 15-minute walk to the school, she was told the polling stations were down and were waiting on repairs. She decided to walk back to Ackerman Union, drop her shift and wait in the 3-hour line.    Henry Burke, a fourth-year political science student who volunteered at the polls, said he believes the long wait times are tantamount to voter suppression.    When I was canvassing voters, none of them  if they have work, if they have class  they weren't able to wait in line for four hours, Burke said. A lot of our new voters, they've never voted before so they're already nervous, coming to the polls for the first time. So LA County, having this awful process, is suppressing the votes of students.    When they tried to send students to voting stations within walking distance, students still confronted wait times of 2.5 to three hours, Burke said.    But waiting was worth it in the end, said Jade McVay, a fourth-year bioengineering student.    I got free food, water and I met people from The Princess Diaries, and I got to have my vote cast, she said. Ideally, though, there will be a system to make this go a bit faster.

The Bruins are currently riding a four-game winning streak after defeating all of the Pac-12 teams they played at home last weekend. The wins included a 3-2 defeat of the Trojans  one that could be replicated Wednesday.  Were playing USC, said sophomore Abby Van Winkle. There is a lot of emotion in that game, just up and down on every single court  UCLA and USC played each other a total of six times last season, with each team winning three of those matchups. The Bruins three losses to the Trojans were their only losses of the 2019 season and included a 1-2 record to USC at Merle Norman Stadium.  USC has already dropped four matches this season, compared to UCLA's two on the season. However, the Trojans are undefeated at home. If the Bruins were to again lose to the Trojans while in enemy territory, they would pick up their third loss of the season with 22 matches left on the schedule. UCLA lost three matches in its entire 2019 season.  We will go in there just hungry and wanting to win, especially since we will be at their home, Van Winkle said. I know they are going to come out hard, especially since they didn't have a very good weekend. (We are) just kind of going into it strong and with our own goals in mind.

The findings, which were released Feb. 28, are the first report of an ongoing study by UCLA political science professor Lynn Vavreck and political science associate professor Chris Tausanovitch.  Vavreck and Tausanovitch have been interviewing about 6,250 people every week since July, and will continue to do so until inauguration day as a part of their study called Nationscape.  The Nationscape study found that Democratic supporters tend to agree on most topics, such as tax cuts for lower-income families and a path for Dreamers to become citizens, regardless of which candidate they&#8217;re supporting. This allows each of the candidates to receive support from a multitude of people with different ideological views.  The study&#8217;s goal is to figure out what people&#8217;s priorities are by going beyond just asking what people agree and disagree on, Vavreck said.  Most of the survey seems like a typical election survey with questions asking who a person is voting for, how they feel about the presidential candidates and how they feel about 50 certain issues, Vavreck said. However, there&#8217;s also a part that asks people to choose between two sets of policies, she added.  For example, a person would have to decide whether they would rather live in a world where there&#8217;s 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, but abortion is illegal, or if they would rather live in a world where there&#8217;s no paid maternity leave, but abortion is legal, Vavreck said.  &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to force people to make choices about the kind of world they want to live in,&#8221; Vavreck said. &#8220;So we make people choose which world they prefer, and everybody does that at least 10 times. And by doing that, they reveal to us which issues are the most important ones to them and so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re really hoping to figure out.&#8221;  According to the first release of the data, published in partnership with  USA Today , background checks for gun purchases has overwhelming bipartisan support so far, with 84% of Republicans and 92% of Democrats supporting the background checks.  Construction of a wall on the United States&#8217; southern border with Mexico, on the other hand, is one of the most decisive policies with only 13% of Democrats supporting the wall compared to 70% of Republicans.  Vavreck added that so far there appeared to be a difference between Democrats and Republicans in terms of their priorities, but among Democratic supporters, there weren&#8217;t many differences.  &#8220;All Democrats seem to have the same kind of priorities, whether they&#8217;re supporting Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden,&#8221; Vavreck said. &#8220;But all those people are different from Republicans.&#8221;  Based on the study, it seems there are a lot of people with a variety of political opinions supporting each of the candidates, Tausanovitch said.  &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like you need to be a progressive candidate necessarily in the Democratic primary to get votes from progressives,&#8221; Tausanovitch said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like you necessarily need to be a moderate candidate in order to get votes from moderates, and that means that a primary process like this could result in candidates with very different ideological profiles doing well.&#8221;  Democratic voters&#8217; ideological views don&#8217;t seem to serve as a constraint on who the Democratic nominee could be, Tausanovitch added. It could result in a nominee who&#8217;s a relatively centrist Democrat or an avowed democratic socialist, he said.  &#8220;The typical way that we think democracy should work is that people choose the candidate that best fits their views, and that doesn&#8217;t appear to be what is happening,&#8221; Tausanovitch said. &#8220;At least within the Democratic primary.&#8221;  Results from the study will be continuously posted every week on USA Today, according to a  UCLA press release .  By the end of the study, Vavreck and Tausanovitch hope to have interviewed 500,000 people in total, with at least 1,000 people from every congressional district in the country.  By having 1,000 people from each congressional district, the study will be able to tell stories about the country, Vavreck said. They can tell the differences between being a Republican in Michigan compared to California, and the differences between being in the country&#8217;s interior versus being on the coast, she added.  Vavreck said they designed the study after the 2016 presidential election prompted questions about polarization and split among Americans and their political views.  &#8220;We wanted to design a story that could actually tell us whether people were more similar or dissimilar across the country, and no one had the data to know that,&#8221; Vavreck said. &#8220;So we thought that we could collect the data and we could really have something to say about how people are the same or different across the landscape of the country.&#8221; ",['cap-saumya-gupta'],"['campus', 'national', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.nationscapefindings.JHan_.jpg

Adapting to Gov. Gavin Newsom&#8217;s  &#8220;stay at home order,&#8221;    the Shakespeare Company at UCLA will be rehearsing their spring productions remotely and releasing them online as radio plays.  The casts of &#8220;Richard III&#8221; and &#8220;I Build Giants&#8221; will be rehearsing over   Zoom and recording their own audio for the sound designers and editors to string together as one complete play, said third-year theater student Mary Alex Daniels.   Serving as co-artistic director, Daniels said this is the first time the company will be attempting to navigate the virtual territory of radio plays. Without the aid of props and visible characters to set each scene, the directors of each play are forced to find new ways to establish a stage setting through adding ambient noises and altering the scripts to address characters by name.    &#8220;It is all kind of a big experiment,&#8221; Daniels said. &#8220;But this whole time is unprecedented, so we are testing things out to see how we can still have an outlet for creativity even through social distancing.&#8221;   [Related:    CAP suspends all performances, shifts shows to next season   ]   The novel coronavirus has uprooted many parts of life and Daniels said the company felt an obligation to provide students with the same structure they would have had on campus. Daniels said their main challenges as they continue the season with radio plays will be the editing process for the audio clips and maintaining the same intimacy the actors would have had on a real stage.  While plays and productions naturally allow actors to embody their characters and build off each other's emotions in a shared space, Daniels said the directors are navigating virtual rehearsals just as they would in person. The actors will still be running each scene remotely with their scene partners, allowing them to maintain a level of emotional connection throughout the play.     ""Virtual rehearsal requires another level of focus and determination from the actors,"" Daniels said. ""They will put together a performance and have that same level of commitment but connect through technology rather than real people and real moments.""   As there will clearly be no set designs for the audiences to observe, Daniels said the company will be implementing different elements of sound design to provide a sense of environment. Creating these various soundscapes   &#8211;   such as a loud, booming battlefield in &#8220;Richard III""   &#8211;   is essential for radio plays. Luckily, she said, the plays they had in line for spring quarter are poetic enough in their text that they do not require them to be physically set in a decorative stage, but the addition of sound will help provide a setting for listeners.  &#8220;When you are usually at a theater, the curtain comes up, you are introduced to this world through design and costume,&#8221; Daniels said. &#8220;Now, we are really heavily reliant on text to tell that story.&#8221;  Working alongside Daniels as co-artistic director of the company, third-year theater student Isabelle Smith said she is unwilling to let a season slip away because of the current circumstances. She said establishing a scene solely based on sound is a challenge with radio plays, but the actors are now allowed to reimagine their work through their vocals. Without having to focus on their bodies, Smith said actors concentrate all of their energy into their voices.   Despite missing that grand moment on stage that actors spend months preparing for, Smith said she hopes the virtual meetings will almost bring excitement through a sense of normalcy that the student actors need. On the technical side, many actors will be using a cellphone as a recording device so the company is troubleshooting how they will get optimal sound quality, Smith said  . Editing the plays will also be a lengthy and difficult process, but she said it is important to keep creating an artistic community by any means possible.  &#8220;It is a sad time generally,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;That's why I especially wanted to make sure we did something this quarter &#8211;  even if it wasn't in the ideal way we imagined putting these plays on &#8211; because we still get to create a community even if it is in a different, digital way.&#8221;   [Related:    Transition to online class poses unique challenges for TFT students, instructors     ]   Recognizing radio plays as an exciting opportunity, second-year theater student Sylvia Abrams-Wolffsohn is directing ""Richard III"" and said relying on audio allows her to   explore the text's depth. She said she aims to highlight the intention behind every conversation between the characters through the quality and range of the actors' voices. In an attempt to separate the voices of each actor and establish distinct characters, Abrams-Wolffsohn said she will work with sound designers to have separate ambient noises for each character.  &#8220;I am interested in how the sound design and overall atmosphere of the soundscape convey a certain mood, person or attention,&#8221; Abrams-Wolffsohn said. &#8220;I am interested in tying certain sounds to certain people.&#8221;  Although theater relies heavily on in-person connection, Daniels said the Shakespeare Company is transitioning online to foster a much-needed community during these very uncertain times. She said they want to continue providing students with some sense of normalcy among the unpredictable events that are unfolding. Theater encompasses empathy on a human level despite any circumstance, and Daniels said it is crucial to continue storytelling.  &#8220;It is really important to take the uncertainty and take these challenges on as artists,&#8221; Daniels said. &#8220;We need to come out the other side stronger and with new ways to connect to our audiences.&#8221; ",[],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/image.jpeg-1.jpg

While the group usually performs pop songs with a featured soloist, this time its members opted for a collective ensemble-oriented piece, with the 17-member group performing Billie Eilish's ""when the party's over."" Scattertones President Aram Krakirian, a fourth-year business economics student, said the group's choice to switch up its signature style was based on a desire to   experiment with the drastic emotional changes that unfold throughout the song.  We needed to think about what we wanted the audience to feel for different parts of the song, Krakirian said. It made us have to pay more attention to body language, facial expressions and our connections to each other onstage. That made it significantly different from the usual upbeat songs.  For an ensemble piece, the group places more importance on harmonizing among all members, as there isnt a soloist to draw attention away from minor vocal flaws, said Haley Mark, a second-year business economics student and business manager for Scattertones. Without a live performance, each member has individually recorded and contributed their pieces, which contribute to the full, layered sonic experience alongside their video element. Mark said members are accustomed to practicing individually to ensure quality isn't lost in the transition from an in-person show.  We usually have multiple performances each quarter, Mark said. Even the new people join in as soon as possible, and we spend a lot of time alone and together to polish and harmonize. It comes down to a day-by-day basis where were continuously pushing ourselves to be better.  Mark said the group's collective love of a cappella eased the stress of creating a virtual performance. Usually, practices demand a minimum of six hours for group rehearsal a week and even more in private, she said, but the positive chemistry among its members creates a supportive environment meant to motivate members. Paravi Das, a first-year theater student, said she felt the connection between performance quality and group dynamic even before formally joining the group.  During callback auditions, the alumni came and sang with the current members, Das said. Its incredible that while you may not know the person, youve shared the same experiences and emotions through singing and made an intimate bond that goes beyond simply being performers together.  This intimate bond helps motivate individuals to refine their performance, said Carly Wood, a second-year theater student. For this year's Spring Sing, Wood credits this bond as a key factor in maintaining her desire to prepare and perform, even while separated from other members of the group.  ""The relationship aspect of it is everything,"" Wood said. ""While I love music itself, being together with other members was always why I want to go to rehearsals every week.""    For Scattertones, its members' musical and emotional dynamic is central to the quality of every performance, Krakirian said. Theres a natural synchronicity to the group when it is performance-ready, and that requires every member to be on the same page with emotions, group dynamic and rhythm.  While the group works with a music director, Krakirian said its still integral that everyone shares their emotional and creative interpretation of the piece and come to an agreement regarding style and vision before any rehearsing begins. This way, everyone understands the collective goals for the piece, creating an overall cohesive performance.  Sometimes, when you finish a song, you need to take a moment, Krakirian said. Everyones silent and looking at each other like, Wow, we just did that, and at that moment you know a song is ready.  &nbsp;  Scattertones has been prepared for Spring Sing since February, Mark said. Although the group has since made creative changes, such as cutting out choreography, Mark said the transition to a virtual platform has been smooth, and the group's performance should retain the quality of a live show.  Scattertones has always been about music and people, Mark said. We want to bring our best to each performance, but the most important thing is that we enjoy the experience onstage and that the audience enjoys it along with us.",['cap-yiqing-hu'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Scattertones-1.jpg

The podcast, a reflection on UCLA and the class of 2020, is embedded below, though you can also click here for a transcript.   [embed]https://soundcloud.com/dailybruin/bye-bye-bruins[/embed]  Strange doors open for people at UCLA. My door opened in the beginning of my second year  when, inspired by how much fun two of my friends seemed to be having, I applied to join the Daily Bruin as an Opinion columnist.  Little did I know that decision would eventually lead to me experiences like interviewing Sen. Dianne Feinstein, regularly seeing former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano at University of California Board of Regents meetings or sitting at the same table as Chancellor Gene Block in a quarterly editorial board meeting  much less that Id also go on to train as a News contributor, Copy contributor, assistant Opinion editor and Radio producer.  Being a journalist was a big job  one that rarely overlapped with the work I did as a student. Thats because, like many others at the Daily Bruin, Im a South Campus student. Though unlike some, I dont feel the need to announce that on a near monthly basis. As a result, I learned things at the Daily Bruin I wouldnt have anywhere else  especially not in a molecular, cell and developmental biology classroom.  Thats why I never expected one of the most useful scientific skills I have now to come from the newsroom: asking tough questions.  Its easy to accept the world as it is. It takes little to no effort. But poking at the edges of things is where I and those like me at the Daily Bruin thrive. Why is it that the UCLA Community Programs Office had thousands of dollars to spend on headshots? Why dont more students vote in undergraduate student government elections? Why does Block think offering six students 10 minutes of his time once a quarter counts as making himself accessible? Answers to questions like these may not have always made our pages  but something about knowing them was satisfying nonetheless.  But it was only when I learned to ask tough questions about the Daily Bruin that I learned the most valuable lessons about journalism, newsrooms and people. Lessons like how even in the critical environment of a newsroom, people will follow anyone who has an ounce of charisma  regardless of whether theyre being led off a cliff. Lessons like the fact the Daily Bruin, like most other newsrooms, isnt self-critical enough when it comes to our mistakes  and we sure as hell dont know how to navigate a controversy.  Three years working here has shown me how newsrooms can lack foresight. That doesnt diminish the work we produce or take away from what was the experience of a lifetime  it just explains why things arent better. The Daily Bruin, for instance, prides itself on being UCLAs unofficial journalism school but doesnt really commit to teaching our newest staffers. Instead, we put them through a wartime briefing given across three days before sending them off into the world. Staffers arent taught how to create great journalism  they wrestle for morsels of knowledge from editors too busy for them.  [caption id=""attachment_385481"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Courtesy of Omar Said)[/caption]  It doesnt help that the future of the Daily Bruin  the future of everything, really  is hard to think about because of COVID-19. But some things also havent changed at all. Much like the Opinion editors of years past, I worked alone to rebuild a struggling, almost nonexistent Radio department  one shuttered just as it and the idea of podcasting in popular culture were beginning to pick up steam.  Of course, I havent yet said a word about the long nights, the countless hours, the magic that would fill the room as people grew tired. But in truth, I dont really have to. No one who wasnt there could really understand it, and no one who was there needs me to explain it to them. All there is to say is that the nights mattered. I will never forget walking home after sending the next days paper to the printer or the feeling of finally coming out of an editorial board meeting that felt like it might never end.  In the end, I learned that the people who truly care about you are there with you at your highs and lows. Theyre your toughest critics but most ardent supporters  not mindless yes men who praise everything you do.  Truly, I have none other to thank for their support but my colleagues and closest friends at the Daily Bruin: my fellow Opinion editors from last year. Thank you Keshav Tadimeti, my boss who knew more than I ever could, and my counterpart, Ani Gasparyan, who is a better writer than she can ever imagine. In running the Opinion section together, I learned from them almost everything that has changed me as a writer and a person. Moreover, I found in them lifelong friends  friends whove spent the past few months supporting each other through a pandemic.  So when I finally graduate, I wont be sad about my door closing. A new one opened for me a long time ago.   Said was an Opinion columnist and News contributor 2017-2018, assistant Opinion editor 2018-2019, Copy contributor 2018-2020 and Radio editor 2019-2020.

It's stocked on CVS Pharmacy shelves and wellness pop-ups across the city. It's CBD, and you've probably seen it in many of these forms.   Cannabidiol, also known as CBD,   is a specific and abundant cannabinoid that can be found in hemp or cannabis plants.   You might be more familiar with its fellow cannabinoid THC &#8211; the psychoactive element that gives users a ""high."" CBD lacks this psychoactive nature, but releases its own set of chemical reactions that may leave users feeling relief and balance.  Researchers describe CBD as helping to take your body from a sympathetic ""fight or flight"" state to a parasympathetic ""rest and digest"" state. Because of these properties, research supporting CBD use seems to favor its anxiety-relieving effects over its sleep-promoting or depression-relieving effects.  In this scenario, ""helping"" to   regulate symptoms is starkly different from ""treating"" symptoms &#8211; CBD is defined   as   more of a supplement rather than a medication.  It's also important to note that the kind and quality of this cannabinoid can vary based on where you live.    CBD can comes from different sources in different states, and this may lead to variations in product quality or purpose for consumers. Some CBD-based products are sourced from hemp; other products are sourced directly from marijuana. Those sourced from marijuana are only legal in  states where marijuana is also legalized .  The hemp-derived CBD market is growing exponentially in comparison to the legal marijuana market.  Cannabis experts  from the Brightfield Group predict the industry will be worth $22 billion by 2022.   [Related:  Budding Los Angeles:     Intersection of cannabis and educational institutions may soon normalize usage ]     Part of the popularity associated with CBD comes from its broad appeal. Anyone can use it, from athletes to wellness gurus to anyone in between. If you're over 21, you're in the clear to buy it in most states, though South Dakota, Nebraska and Idaho still  outlaw cannabis products  completely .    However, there is a legal gray area and some variation in many local or state governments surrounding the purchasing age for users under 21.  The market may be continuing to grow quickly for a few reasons: effective advertising and social media presence, a growing health-consciousness and, of course, the promised euphoric effects on the body.  However, being cognizant of the difference between wellness and medicine is important in understanding your purchases.   In general, wellness is an all-encompassing term for the actions people take to be free from illness and make choices toward a healthy, fulfilling life. CBD generally tends to fall under the umbrella of wellness products.      Aside from existing solely in wellness products, CBD has started to trickle down into the field of medicine.    For example,  Epidiolex , a form of extracted CBD, was approved in 2018 to help treat and mitigate rare forms of epilepsy in children over 2. Using randomized blind trials and a placebo group, patients given CBD showed decreased seizures.  Despite CBD's inclusion in medicine, there is no regulated, tried-and-true-list of benefits &#8211; or warnings &#8211; for CBD.    The void in research surrounding effective dosage and in what form has led consumers to believe any form of CBD can produce these effects.  In an interview with  The New York Times , James MacKillop of McMaster University said CBD is promising in many different therapeutic ways because it's relatively safe. However, when looking further, a lot of research suggests it may interact negatively with other drugs, cause liver injury.  Of course, the substance is not a panacea and can't claim to fix a wide range of ailments without being Food and Drug Administration-approved.   In fact, in July 2019, the FDA had to  publish a letter  to CBD company Curaleaf, regarding the misbranding of CBD as a drug claiming to treat chronic pain, relieve ADHD symptoms, help chronic anxiety or treat Alzheimer's disease.   [ICYMI:    Researchers unsure about effects of heavy cannabis use, agree on more regulation ]     To make informed decisions about alternative health treatment, it's necessary to be aware that many CBD products &#8211; think gummies, bath salts or face serum &#8211; are not intended for the cure or treatment of disease.   In fact, the actual amount of CBD in these products remains muddled.  CBD may not be as effective when added into wellness products but may be promising as a treatment for drug usage.  In the same The New York Times article,   Yasmin Hurd, director of the Addiction Institute of Mount Sinai, said CBD is ineffective when its put into mascara or tampons. However, it presents potential for helping people with heroin addiction.  Srikar Poruri, a second-year cognitive science student, said he and his friends once tried CBD once as an alternative to nicotine.  ""I remember distinctl  y one time   being like 'Oh, it's not a scam,'"" Poruri said. ""It made me feel relaxing. ... I remember feeling lighter in general.""  While Poruri said he thinks CBD definitely has relaxant effects and is not as addictive as nicotine, he also said the effects may be placebo.  Despite CBD's reputation of being a ""bougie"" wellness commodity seen in dog treats or gold face masks, CBD in many of its forms may become more accessible for a diverse range of people. There are places we can find CBD outside of LA's wellness bubble. CBD company Phoenix Tears signed a contract in 2018 to sell its products to over 5,000 7-Eleven stores in an attempt to reach a new market.  A combination of transparent producers and educated consumers is important when choosing an alternative health option, and this remains true for CBD purchasing.   One way to find CBD is to visit The Farmacy Westwood on Gayley Ave or Happy Leaf Collective on Westwood Boulevard and speak with a professional to help you make the best choice for your needs.     This handy little CBD cannabinoid has big potential, and if purchased smartly, may help individuals find their niche among the intersection of medicine and wellness.

The North Westwood Neighborhood Council, a body representing UCLA and the Village to the Los Angeles City Council, recommended changes to food and parking regulations in the Village&#8217;s 1989 zoning and regulatory framework known as the Westwood Village Specific Plan.  The council&#8217;s recommended changes are intended to reduce or eliminate barriers for businesses to set up in the Village, which has a vacancy rate of around 20%. LA City Planning met with the council during its Wednesday board  meeting  to receive feedback on potential changes before drafting an ordinance.  Zuriel Espinosa, a city planning associate, presented options to amend the Specific Plan at the board meeting. After the presentation, the board unanimously called for LA City Planning to remove the distinction between restaurants and fast-food establishments. They also requested the department reduce or eliminate parking restrictions in the Village.  The city council tasked LA City Planning to draft certain changes to the Village&#8217;s plan in  November . Since then, City Planning officials have considered potential options to change food and parking regulations in the plan, Espinosa said.  Currently, the Specific Plan defines food establishments as either fast-food establishments or restaurants and limits how many of each can exist on each street. These definitions limit trendy, fast-casual food establishments from opening in the Village, Espinosa said.  Fast-casual establishments typically feature healthy, organic and refined food options, Espinosa said. The current Specific Plan tends to define these as fast-food establishments, which are limited in the Village, he added.  &#8220;Our definition is not keeping in line with the changing consumer demands related to food and commercial needs,&#8221; Espinosa said.  NWWNC president Michael Skiles said he supported removing the distinction between fast-food establishments and restaurants because he wants to see more affordable food establishments fill vacancies in the Village.  &#8220;I think our council would like to see more affordable food options, more options that serve students and workers on busy lunch breaks,&#8221; Skiles said. &#8220;Those aren&#8217;t sit-down restaurants, those are fast-casual and fast-food options.&#8221;  Skiles said he thinks the current regulations were meant to prevent fast-food establishments such as Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken from taking over the Village and encourage sit-down restaurants and retail instead.  &#8220;I just never see fast-food in the traditional sense overriding this Village,&#8221; Skiles said. &#8220;I just economically don&#8217;t see it and see these regulations as counterproductive.&#8221;  In addition to removing the distinction between fast-food establishments and restaurants, the council also recommended the removal of all ratios, caps and quota restrictions that limit the number or type of food establishments in the Village.  Councilmember Kevin Crummy, a business stakeholder, said he thinks the current zoning regulations are unusually restrictive compared to those of other neighborhoods in LA, such as Sawtelle.  &#8220;We have much better demographics, access and people, yet Sawtelle is crushing us,&#8221; Crummy said.  Crummy added he would like to see more retail in the Village, but he does not think restricting the types of businesses that can move in is helpful. For example, Crummy said boutique retail is moving into Sawtelle because trendy food joints are attracting customers to the area.  &#8220;As much as I want retail in the Village, the way that we are going to get it is by letting the market determine business,&#8221; Crummy said.  On the topic of parking restrictions, the council recommended City Planning remove all requirements on the number of parking spaces a business should have in the Village with 12 in favor, one opposed and one abstention. Crummy opposed the motion because he thinks it is too radical to eliminate all restrictions.   &#8220;We are not in a pedestrian utopia. We won&#8217;t have a subway for eight years, provided they are on time,&#8221; Crummy said, referring to LA Metro&#8217;s planned Purple Line extension into Westwood. &#8220;I just think that's a little too radical, and I would rather live in the world that we live in today.&#8221;  Crummy added he thinks this position could make the council appear radical to other stakeholders and city officials who may disregard the council&#8217;s recommendations.  Councilmember Amir Tarighat said he thinks it would be reasonable to eliminate all parking restrictions because it would prepare the Village for a future when restrictions might be a burden, just as the 1989 restrictions are a burden now.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it's that crazy of an idea to say that businesses should determine on their own if they think they need parking,&#8221; Tarighat said.  The council unanimously asked City Planning that, if they could not completely eliminate restrictions, at least eliminate several restrictions on parking for historic buildings, hotels, movie theaters, nightclubs and offices.   They also recommended the removal of requirements on replacing parking and change of use parking. Instead of these restrictions, the council recommended the Village be governed by general citywide zoning rules.   Lastly, the council asked for certain changes to other parking regulations if not all parking restrictions could be removed.  For instance, the council unanimously called for allowing businesses to lease parking spots from property owners rather than enter into long-term agreements, or covenants, with the owners, which can be enforced even when ownership of the property transfers.  Crummy said covenants are unfavorable for property owners, and securing them can hold up businesses from opening. For example, Tocaya Organica, a trendy Mexican joint, delayed its opening because it had difficulty securing a covenant agreement.  &#8220;Nobody in their right mind would put an encumbrance on their property in favor of another person, but you would obviously do a lease,&#8221; Crummy said.  The council also called for City Planning to increase the allowable distance businesses can designate off-site parking to a quarter mile if parking restrictions are not entirely removed. Such a move would give business more options to secure off-site parking.  Following this outreach phase, City Planning will draft an ordinance with community feedback in mind, Espinosa said. From there the ordinance must undergo environmental review and public hearings before the city council votes on it, he added.

""We&#8217;ve definitely had highs and lows,"" said senior Kyla Ross. ""Just having that fight for each other is what keeps us strong.""  Balance beam is the only event in which No. 3 UCLA gymnastics (6-2, 4-2 Pac-12) has held lower than a No. 5 national ranking at any point this season, dipping as low as No. 39 during the first month of the season. But as the Bruins continued to compete through February, their beam scores and national ranking slowly increased.   This week marked the first in which UCLA was named in the top five nationally on the event after it scored a second-straight score of 49.525 versus then-No. 18 Oregon State.  ""Beam knocked it out of the park (Saturday), and we keep building momentum and  confidence there, and you can feel it in the beam squad,"" said coach  Chris Waller. ""So that was really exciting to see them continue to just  keep growing.""  The struggles on beam are new to UCLA this season, as the Bruins had not finished a season ranked outside the top five on the event since 2014 and hadn't scored below a 49.000 since the first meet of the 2017 season.   The streak of 44 meets with at least a 49.000 score ended with UCLA's first meet of the 2020 season, as seniors Grace Glenn and Felicia Hano both fell to start off the Bruins' beam rotation at the Collegiate Challenge on Jan. 4, eventually resulting in a 48.500 team score.  UCLA's scores continued to fluctuate over the next few weeks, hitting rock bottom with a season-low 47.875 against then-No. 11 Washington on the last day of January.  But starting with UCLA's next meet versus Arizona on Feb. 9, the Bruins steadily started to gain consistency, both in scores and in the lineup.  The Arizona meet and the next week's Arizona State meet featured scores of 49.375 and 49.275, respectively, and UCLA started to find more consistency in the lineup that would regularly go out and compete.   ""We also have been moving around the lineup, so (each) week was just another test week, trying out another lineup,"" Hano said after UCLA's recent win over Oregon State.  Nine gymnasts have competed on beam at least once this season for the Bruins.   But now, the same six gymnasts have competed in the same order  in the last two meets versus then-No. 3 Utah and Oregon State, and the lineup produced season-high scores of 49.525 in both competitions, as the gymnasts went 12-for-12 in hit routines.   Included in this run of hit routines was beam specialist Glenn's first career perfect 10 &#8211; which was also the first perfect score in any event from the leadoff spot in NCAA history &#8211; and two 9.975s for Ross, who has gone 9.950 or higher in seven meets.  With higher consistency in beam scores has come better overall meet scores, including a season-high 198.025 versus Utah. This has been reflected in UCLA's rising regional qualifying score, as the Bruins now rank  No. 3 in the country and No. 1 in the conference with a 197.425.  ""In terms of our RQS, ultimately, we want to be ranked up in the top three for the remainder of the regular season,"" Waller said. ""It was really important for us to drop a 196 score, and we&#8217;re looking forward to the next meet to be able to bump it up again.""

Growing up as a golden child in an Asian household, I have never been someone to hold many opinions. Authority figures were to be respected and cultural expectations defined right from wrong, what I could and could not do and how I should feel. My achievements became my identity &#8211; I worked hard in high school not because I was ambitious, but rather to flex. I probably wanted the smart kids to accept me.  A side effect of this mindset, though, was that I had a shaky self-image. By the time I started attending college, I had no idea who I was or what kind of person I wanted to be. I also had thin skin &#8211; I wanted to be liked, to not rock the boat.   Joining the Daily Bruin as a News intern forced me out of my shell and helped me become more comfortable talking with strangers and not fearing authority figures. I learned to be assertive when interviewees avoided my questions. And I learned to tolerate criticism, such as when Tod Tamberg, the university&#8217;s senior executive director of media relations, said I was misinformed in my coverage of the protests against  UCLA&#8217;s treatment of hospital valet workers .   I stopped running away from tense situations despite freaking out on the inside, such as when UC President Janet Napolitano stared me down as I tried to take a photo during a press conference during which she apologized for  interfering with a California state audit  &#8211; or when retired UC Regent Norman Pattiz called me unexpectedly regarding an article about a  lawsuit against him .   Being a reporter has also forced me to stand my ground, especially when it came to protecting my sources within my lawful rights as a reporter. I was worried when the defense attorney in  The People vs. Alberto Medina  sent her private investigator to demand my interview notes to  allege juror malpractice , but was glad The Bruin stood by me.  Facing criticism had taught me to defend myself and my work.   While I learned how to write under time pressure as a news reporter, being the national and higher education News editor for a year taught me the importance of routine and support &#8211; things I relied on heavily to get through my third year at UCLA. Those who know me understand how much I struggled that year academically and otherwise. I was pretty much on autopilot.   Classes became harder for me, as I switched from a North Campus writing-intensive major to math, and my self-doubt amplified as I struggled to navigate through a male-dominated field full of people who were smarter than me.   I felt even more alone when a fellow student I considered my friend took a photo of me from Facebook and put it on 4chan &#8211; a website notorious for doxxing &#8211; and my face went somewhat viral among the alt-right community. I struggled with acknowledging how terrified and alone I felt, and instead spent time isolating myself and debating over whether I had the right to feel this way. I felt betrayed by classmates who would still associate with him and confused by the dichotomy of my friend's responses &#8211; being genuinely scared for my safety or asserting I was overreacting. My overwhelming anxiety affected my ability to concentrate and ultimately affected my grades. I told my professor I was fine; I didn&#8217;t want to seem weak.   But my fellow editors were the ones who noticed how much I was struggling before I even wanted to acknowledge it myself. I am eternally grateful to my fellow 2017-2018 News editors, Rupan, Hedy, Jacob, Anny and Emi. Being an assistant editor meant having to spend time in the office every day, and this routine kept me sane &#8211; allowing me to focus on the hectic news cycle without isolating myself. I am also grateful to all the friends who carried me through my classes and enriched my life, including my longtime best friend Vanessa &#8211; with whom I explored most of Los Angeles, my math clique and Keshav, the 2017-2019 Opinion editor &#8211; who sat with me into the early hours of the morning every week as I struggled with computer science lab classes.   In a way, reporting on authorities and watching how they fiercely (and sometimes shamelessly) defended themselves taught me to stand by my own work and ultimately stand by myself &#8211; to be my own advocate.   So, after five years, four major changes and a midlife crisis, I am finally graduating &#8211; from UCLA and my old ways.

The two   play the   beleaguered couple Leilani and Jibran in &#8220;The Lovebirds,&#8221; the first film to be released on Netflix after its theatrical premiere was canceled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The central pair unwittingly become accomplices to a murder just minutes after breaking up and quickly   decide to work together to clear their names, leading them down a rabbit hole of blackmail and black-tie cult gatherings. Though the film&#8217;s story gets convoluted, Rae and Nanjiani are able to salvage the muddy plot with their razor-sharp comedic wit and hilarious chemistry.   [Related:    Movie review: &#8216;The Half of It&#8217; offers fresh perspective on what a teenage rom-com can be   ]   The plot of ""The Lovebirds"" starts out with an air of intrigue, but is soon bogged down with unnecessary complications and loose threads, becoming   less a mystery and more of a mess. Within minutes, Leilani and Jibran are wrapped up in a complex   web of conspiracy, having to confront an absurd lineup of foes &#8211; a congressman and his wife, a blackmail ring operating out of a fraternity and eventually a nefarious cult that&#8217;s equal parts Illuminati, &#8220;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale&#8221; and &#8220;Eyes Wide Shut.&#8221;  All the individual capers with one-off characters make for entertaining vignettes, but fail to tie   together cohesively  . The final plot twist fails to make sense of the jumble, barely registering as an anticlimactic reveal. In a film full of inventive   quips and conversations, the finale is far from the most memorable scene in the film, which deflates a lot of the momentum the story generates.  Luckily, Rae and Nanjiani's easy chemistry and awkward humor transcend the narrative jumble. Whether they&#8217;re arguing over   the odds of orgy schedulers using a calendar app or intimidating answers out of a terrified fraternity brother, their back and forth feels effortless as they operate on the same wavelength of frenetic, weird energy.     Their palpable onscreen connection makes it easy to both believe the love between the two as well as understand why they&#8217;ve started to grate on each other after four years together. They might   argue with comical conviction about whether or not they&#8217;d do well on &#8220;The Amazing Race,"" but the conversation hints at the deeper emotional insecurities about incompatibility that plague their relationship.   [Related:    Movie review: Despite its detailed animation, &#8216;The Willoughbys&#8217; delivers an uninspiring comedy   ]   The two comedians also bring versatility and depth to their   characters.   Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, Leilani and Jibran are falling in love, breaking up and witnessing   their first murder. The actors take the fast pacing in stride, matching it with equally fast-paced jokes.    Though ""The Lovebirds"" isn't necessarily a traditional romantic comedy, the movie makes Leilani and Jibran's break up more than just a plot point   &#8211; it&#8217;s a scene with heartbreaking gravity.   The quiet tension that fills the car after another blowout argument adds a sense of realism to their relationship, making it impossible not to root for   their reconciliation as they go on their adventure. The narrative arc of the film may fail, but the emotional arc is where the film finds its footing.  Not to mention, ""The Lovebirds"" is flat-out funny.   From the ridiculous scenarios Leilani and Jibran find themselves in to the one-liners Rae and Nanjiani scatter throughout the film, &#8220;The Lovebirds&#8221;   never fails to earn a laugh, even in its most serious scenes. The easily enjoyable   film is able to span the range of comedy by blending physical slapstick comedy with witty dialogue   to   produce     a   compact 86-minutes full of levity and heart. The film is in no way groundbreaking,   but it puts Rae and Nanjiani firmly into the spotlight, demonstrating their potential for larger silver-screen roles.  The two transform an easily mediocre film into a fun, enjoyable comedy that offers a brief escape from reality.

Salcedo was charged with fraud and bribery in March 2019 for accepting bribes of up to $200,000 to help admit two students without any competitive soccer experience as athletic recruits. Salcedo resigned as UCLA mens soccer coach nine days after allegations surfaced.  Salcedos charges were part of the larger 2019 college admissions scandal, which involved several university athletic directors and coaches helping admit applicants as athletic recruits despite having no competitive experience in exchange for payments from the applicants parents.  Salcedos lawyers claimed the fraud charges, which included mail fraud, wire fraud and honest services fraud, would be valid only if there was a corresponding victim, according to Salcedos subpoena request.  Salcedos lawyers declined to comment for legal reasons.  The evidence obtained from the subpoena would allow Salcedo to prove that UCLA is not a victim of any of the fraud-based charges ...

No. 12 UCLA women&#8217;s golf finished fourth in the Darius Rucker Intercollegiate on Sunday at the Long Cove Club in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Three freshmen led the Bruin scorecard.  Freshmen Emilie Paltrinieri and Emma Spitz finished tied for 10th place, and freshman Annabel Wilson tied for 29th.  ""(Paltrinieri and Spitz) are both doing a great job,"" Forsyth said. ""They're freshmen. They're finishing top 10s every time we tee it up. Can't ask for much more than that as a coach.""  At the end of day one, UCLA was in second place after the Bruins shot an 8-over 292, taking five more strokes to complete their rounds than first place No. 7 Wake Forest. Spitz and Paltrinieri both shot even-par 71s, finishing the day tied for third.  This was all despite windy conditions that day and such poor conditions the previous day that the Bruins weren't able to take a practice round before the tournament, according to coach Carrie Forsyth.  ""Three of the girls hadn't seen the golf course, (but) we had our two seniors that did (in years past),"" Forsyth said. ""Part of the beauty of playing golf like that and not having a practice round (is) you don't see the trouble because you haven't seen it before. You can just be really focused on your lines, and they did a really good job with that.""   The second day of play was not much different, as UCLA and Wake Forest both shot 4-over 288s, leaving the Bruins ahead of the Demon Deacons by five shots.  Spitz and Paltrinieri matched each other again, both shooting 1-over 72s, and, after starting the day tied for 33rd, Wilson shot a 2-under 69, finishing the day tied for seventh.  ""The first two rounds the golf was extremely difficult and the wind was blowing really hard, and they handled it fantastically,"" Forsyth said. ""They were hitting quality shots (and) making some putts.""   In the third round, the freshmen Bruins in the lineup shot their worst rounds of the tournament. Spitz and Paltrinieri matched each other yet again, both shooting 6-over 77s, while Wilson shot an 8-over 79.  ""Neither (Paltrinieri or Spitz) putted very well in the final round,"" Forsyth said. ""(Spitz) in particular, she got a lot of three-putts. (Paltrinieri has) kind of been off and on with the ball striking during the week,""  In past tournaments, Spitz has credited her third-round struggles to problems with her mental game, but she said that was not the issue in last weekend's tournament.   Instead, Spitz said it was the course &#8211; on which one bad shot can derail an entire hole &#8211; that made the third round difficult for her.   ""I knew what I had to do &#8211; not put the pressure on myself and not think about the scoring, and I really was doing it,"" Spitz said. ""It was just one of those days where nothing went my way.""  Aside from the freshmen, senior Clare Legaspi shot a 13-over 226 to tie for 43rd, and senior Mariel Galdiano shot a 14-over 227 to tie for  46th.   The final round saw UCLA to a fourth-place finish, 30 shots behind first-place Wake Forest. However, the Bruins were only one and four strokes worse than the third- and second-place finisher, respectively.

Throughout the year, seniors in the undergraduate and graduate film programs work on their thesis films, which are long-term projects students focus on to fulfill their graduation requirements. Traditionally, these films are displayed at the end of the year in showcases at the James Bridges Theater at UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television. Because of   the   coronavirus   safety   guidelines, in-person showcases have been either canceled or postponed. However, graduate student and day-of-event producer Regina Kim said most of the showcases, along with the annual screenwriting competition, will still occur   virtually.    ""For us, it didn't make sense to delay the showcase and hold onto the winners for six months to a year, so our team decided we should do this virtually,"" Kim said.   [Related:   Creatives continue to create through entertainment industry's pause amid pandemic ]    As one of the day-of-event producers, Kim said she handles the logistics of the actual event, while graduate student and screenwriting competition producer Catherine Wilkins said she oversees the judges' administration team. Although Wilkins said many   aspects of the   in-person   event will remain  such as   the PowerPoint   to present each script    some   adjustments still have to be   made for   the virtual format.  Normally, Kim said the poster team would design posters to be printed and displayed at the entrance for attendees to observe as they find their seats. But now, Kim said the posters will be made virtually along with a sizzle reel look book to portray the tones and themes of each script to viewers at home.   In addition, Wilkins said the video team will replace the recording of in-person interviews with an edited compilation of all   the   finalists' at-home videos describing their script and the inspiration behind it.  One of the showcase finalists in the feature drama category   is graduate   student Paul Sprangers, who said the pandemic has not impacted his writing but   has affected his plans for directing the film over the summer. When writing the script for his feature screenwriting workshop, Sprangers said he wrote it with the intention of shooting the full movie but now will only be able to shoot the first 10-15 minutes of the film with a small crew. In contrast, directing finalist and fourth-year film student   Victor Rocha said he   was able to complete his filming before the pandemic.  During the first five weeks of fall quarter, we do preproduction and plan for our shoot, and then around week six everybody starts shooting, Rocha said. I finished shooting all the way back in November.   [Related:   Film student seeks to tell a human story of resilience in crowdsourced documentary   ]    Even though Rocha compiled all his footage, he said it was still difficult to edit during the pandemic.   Finding a composer to record and mix sound effects was a challenge because of the closing of businesses and recording stages. As a result of these limitations,   Rocha   said the showcase   deadlines have been repealed by the department, allowing students to finish their film on their own time. Unlike the screenwriting competition, however,   Rocha said the directing showcase will not be a virtual event  , and the department will instead wait for the end of the stay-at-home order to host a live showing  .  The directing   showcase so far doesnt have a date to it,""   Rocha said. ""But everybody still wants it to happen because we want to be able to see our films on the big screen in the James Bridges Theater.    Although the directing showcase will not be held virtually, the department is currently working on an informational website to recognize the work of the graduating undergraduate film class. The website will allow the directing showcase   to follow in the footsteps of the screenwriting competition by   honoring students at the end of the school year despite the obstacle of the pandemic.  Our number one option is still in-person, no matter how long we have to wait, but we want to have something in the meantime, Rocha said.

At UCLA, our community is remarkably united by similar feelings of loss, confusion and concern, but also by light, hope and the perspective that the pandemic has brought to the forefront.

While the main topics of debate have shifted, our general sentiment is one of anxiousness, caused by the stark revelation that our world is not as stable as so many of us had previously taken for granted. We are painfully aware that we dont know what the future holds, but we are certain that it wont be what we had hoped for.  When not trying to discredit the expertise of highly educated scientists with complex understandings of the issue at hand, political figures on all levels are prioritizing economic growth over public welfare. Seeing those in power handle this crisis in that manner has exacerbated that horrible feeling that has come to saturate my social media feeds.  But for me, this ubiquitous, crushing combination of fear and frustration isnt new.  I have been interested in and passionate about nature and its protection for as long as I can remember. That interest was perhaps the result of my status as a Jewish midwesterner, with strong cultural norms of responsibility for the earths well-being uniting with my frequent exposure to natural spaces. Or maybe it was just an innate passion that would have manifested regardless of my heritage or home.  Origins aside, that environmentalism has led me to academic exploration of the subject. Not only do I spend my free time reading and watching videos about the global catastrophe that is modern humanity, but Ive also dedicated my studies here at UCLA to it.  [caption id=""attachment_380364"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    Kammerer (pictured) doing field research on Cape rockjumpers, a threatened species of bird in inland South Africa, in spring 2019. (Courtesy of Payton Kammerer)[/caption]  And this is what I have learned from pursuing this course of study: my generation will know hardship and catastrophe far more terrible than this pandemic.  I also know that it was preventable.  Experts have been ringing the alarm bells for decades, warning everyone that changing the chemistry of the atmosphere and indiscriminately annihilating ecosystems would have grave ramifications.  But those alarms have fallen upon deaf ears, clogged by the temptations of unbridled economic growth  sound familiar?  While this virus is a short-term issue, the environmental catastrophe we are responsible for is going to unfold in the long term. For a long time, I believed that meant it was going to happen slowly. We are knocking over each domino one at a time, and we just need to stop before too many have fallen.  Through my studies at UCLA, Ive come to understand that the dominoes are knocking one another over. Even if we stop pumping carbon into the atmosphere and destroying natural habitats this very second, we have already started that positive feedback loop. The ultimate consequences still lie in wait.  The people making decisions about our collective sacrifice in the middle of the coronavirus are frequently those who, demographically, are at a high risk of suffering severely from it.  In environmental policy, that is not the case.  The consequences of the irresponsibility of our predecessors will not be theirs to bear  they will be ours, our childrens and every other generations burden for the rest of human existence.

And unlike that of this pandemic, it is far from universal.  And so, the events that have characterized this school year take on a much different tone for me. Whenever I find myself upset over them, there is a grim voice in the back of my mind telling me that one day, I will be willing to give anything to come back to this time.  Because it is going to get so much worse.   Payton Kammerer is a second-year ecology, behavior and evolution student from Machesney Park, Illinois, and is an Opinion columnist for the Daily Bruin.

""Da 5 Bloods"" is Lee's first film since his 2019 Academy Awards Best Picture nominee ""BlacKkKlansman"" and it packs just as tough of a punch as its predecessor. With layered and complex themes of racial identity, post-traumatic stress, nostalgia and guilt, ""Da 5 Bloods"" is a dense and challenging film that remains balanced despite tackling heavy subject   matter.  By drawing Oscar-worthy performances out of his cast and infusing a highly original story with his trademark energetic   style, Lee has created one of the most gripping films so far this year.   [Related:    Movie review: Difficult-to-follow narrative redeemed by well-executed comedy in 'The Lovebird    s'   ]     ""Da 5 Bloods"" centers around four veterans   returning to Vietnam to find the remains of their deified infantry leader, Stormin' Norman (Chadwick Boseman), who died in action five decades earlier. But   Norman's bones and dog tags aren't the only things the vets   left behind  they also buried $17 million worth of gold bars in the jungle, and this might be their last chance to bring it home.  Norman's death also   affected   each man differently, and their exploration of modern-day Vietnam sparks flashbacks to key moments in their relationship with him. Paul (Delroy Lindo) was closest to Norman, but he refuses to accept the reality of his PTSD  despite his son David's (Jonathan Majors) concerns and warnings.  While   World Wars I and II have   been portrayed in many high-profile, big-budget movies over the past few years  including ""Dunkirk,"" ""1917,"" ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Jojo Rabbit""  films about the Vietnam War have fallen by the wayside since the turn of the century. While most of ""Da 5 Bloods"" takes place in the present day, Lee doesn't shy   away from the   past atrocities committed in Vietnam and how it has affected people on every side of the conflict to this day.  &nbsp;  Using the Vietnam War   as a thematic springboard, Lee overlays American conflicts from the 1960s and 1970s with civil rights movements that are still underway today. Without his masterful touch, ""Da 5 Bloods"" could have become either too black-and-white or confusing, but Lee walks that line perfectly   by crafting a film that is more resonant now than ever.  Lindo's performance elevates him above his co-stars with a raw and haunting performance that could earn him   a gold statue next year  , but the ensemble nature of the film still gives the other members of ""the bloods""   their standout moments.  Otis (Clarke Peters) is the only other surviving member of the team who gets close to matching Paul's memorability, as his relationships with David and his former lover Tin (Y. Lan) are the film's most touching and wholesome. Boseman, too, makes the most out of limited screen time as Norman, leaving an impact on each of the bloods and making his presence felt long after his death.   [Related:    Movie review: 'Tigertail' offers intimate look into family relationships across generations   ]   The chemistry between the leading men is one of the film's highlights, and the narrative developments between them help Lee build incredible tension. Although the suspense is lost a bit in the second act amid the war flashbacks and plot points that seemingly develop without conflict, the film   manages to regain its footing when the action ramps up down the stretch.  In typical Lee fashion, ""Da 5 Bloods"" is carried by its hyperstylized construction from behind the camera and in postproduction. The constantly shifting aspect ratios, extreme color palettes, abrasive smash cuts and iconic soul soundtrack could have come off as desperate moves in anyone else's hands, but Lee's experience and restraint help him blend them with precision.  His style isn't just restricted to choices made in the edit bay either, as demonstrated by the awe-inspiring   shot composition and original still photography captured by Lee and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel.   The visual contrast between the destruction of war, the   beauty of nature and the characters' internal struggles is handled with care and results in a film that pops in nearly every frame.  With another director at the helm, the style could have drowned out the substance, but Lee complements his visual storytelling with strong theses about race in America and around the world.   Every character makes decisions specific to themselves, and the debates on racial justice, reform and American guilt raise several thought-provoking and opposing viewpoints.  In real life, Black men who fought in Vietnam were fighting for a country that had marginalized them for generations, and Lee sets up that thread through a powerful use of archival footage in the film's opening. As a result, the former soldiers are abused at home and abroad, and their journey to cope with shame on both sides of the ocean makes up   most of the film's emotional core.  ""Da 5 Bloods"" raises a handful of important questions about race relations, violence, revenge and forgiveness, but Lee doesn't bother serving up concrete answers.   It isn't an incomplete film, but rather one that trusts its audienc  e to draw their own conclusions. A film that explicitly stands with Black Lives Matter while remaining subtle, thoughtful and up for interpretation is hard to come by, but Lee manages to craft one through a pointed vision from its very first frame to its last.  And with the conversation surrounding racial tension in America   louder now than ever, Lee's newest film is a must-stream.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/web.ae_.da5bloodsreview.courtesy.jpg

But she didnt stop shooting and finished the night with a season-high 27 field goal attempts and 26 points.  No. 2 seed UCLA womens basketball (26-4, 14-4 Pac-12) battled back from a double-digit deficit in the first quarter to defeat No. 7 seed USC (17-14, 8-10) 73-66 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tournament.  (Onyenwere) continues to amaze me by how she improves and how she's always about the team, said coach Cori Close. She's just one of the most versatile players in the country.  With the Bruins down six heading into the fourth quarter and facing elimination, Onyenwere scored the first 10 points for the Bruins in the final frame. The forward also had her second-best rebounding outing of the season, hauling in 15 boards, including six offensive for her 10th double-double of the season.  (We were) just continuing to fight, string along stops, Onyenwere said. We weren't really playing the way that we knew we could kind of the whole game.  USC scored 11 straight points to start the contest, leaving UCLA with a significant hole to climb out of.  The Trojans forced Close into a timeout just over three minutes into the first quarter, after they poured in the first nine points of the match. The team huddle did little to combat the deficit, as USC extended the lead to 15 points late in the first quarter.  Trojan forward Kayla Overbeck and guard Endyia Rogers combined for 14 points in the opening frame to outscore the entire Bruin team.  After missing all seven 3-point attempts in the first quarter, the Bruins converted four of their six shots from deep in the second quarter. Their accuracy from the field improved from 22.7% in the first frame to 62.5% in the second frame.  Redshirt junior guard Natalie Chou had 11 of her 14 points in the second quarter, going a perfect 4-of-4 from the field in the first half. Despite her first-half performance, Chou played only six minutes in the second half.  I might look back and say what an idiot I was, Close said. Im so thankful for (Chous) character, that she was willing to play whatever role to help the team win. I was debating (putting her back in) in my own mind.  Close said she elected to go with redshirt sophomore Lindsey Corsaro in the second half because of her ability to switch defensively and double-team USCs offensive threats in the post. Corsaro also chimed in with three 3-pointers  matching the total number of 3s she made in her last 12 regular-season matches in a single night.  It's definitely awesome to make shots, Corsaro said. I think my teammates do an awesome job, as well my coaches, of always instilling confidence and always talking about when you've got it get it up there and be confident.  Despite shooting 10 percentage points lower from the field than USC in the first half, UCLA managed to take a one-point lead heading into the locker room by hauling in nine offensive rebounds compared to USCs three.  The Bruins had five turnovers in the third quarter  nearly matching the six giveaways they had in the first half  and shot 26.7% from the field en route to nine points, the only single-digit scoring quarter by either team in the match.  UCLA sporadically employed a full-court press in the first three quarters before switching to it full time in the fourth quarter, with the game clock fading away and elimination on the line.  Close said associate head coach Shannon Perry-Lebeauf was responsible for the tactical defensive adjustment the Bruins made late in the game.  We were just having them get it in and going one-on-one, but we decided to trap and make them go back to their big, Close said. We got a turnover and an and-one that I think really changed the course of the game.  The elevated defensive pressure forced the Trojans into eight turnovers in the fourth quarter alone, and helped the Bruins score nine straight points to put the game away after the score was knotted at 60 apiece. During the stretch, UCLA forced multiple USC backcourt turnovers that turned into offensive opportunities.  UCLA will face either No. 3 seed Stanford or No. 6 seed Oregon State in the semifinals Saturday evening at 8:30 p.m.",['cap-dylan-dsouza'],"['sports', 'womens-basketball']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/DSC_7685-6.jpg

Experts predict that venues may not open again until fall 2021. The canceled shows and stay-at-home orders have not only cost Los Angeles-based artists meaningful connections with fans during live performances but also cost them their financial stability. Lexi Aviles, known professionally as Love You Later, said the solitary nature of quarantine has made it difficult for her to find the creative energy to make music.  &#8220;It's easy, as an artist, to feel like you're kind of just wasting your days away and not really doing what we're meant to do, which is obviously to write music and play music,&#8221; she said.  The routine Aviles has built over her music career is based heavily around collaborative efforts, she said, and online songwriting sessions cannot encapsulate the physical connection she needs for inspiration. Nowadays, she tries to find bursts of motivation through taking walks, doing yoga and checking in with friends online, but it is difficult to replace the tangible interactions and support in the artist community, she said.  But quarantine has also increased her involvement with all aspects of her artistic process. Aviles said she took the opportunity to learn Adobe video editing software to create her own promotion video for her newest EP, &#8220;Heaven is Without You,&#8221; and also taught herself more about the technical aspects of production.   Aviles said being an indie artist makes the quarantine experience tougher, since without a deal or record label she can only rely on herself to stay afloat financially. To mitigate the financial difficulties, she said she is taking up various remote songwriting opportunities and TV and film writing with the hopes of garnering future payoffs.   [Related:    UCLA musicians maximize newfound time by pursuing new projects, art forms   ]   Quarantine has similarly impacted the band Stereo Jane, whose members said the situation has completely shifted their schedules and group dynamic. Vocalist Sydney Schmier said some of their upcoming tracks are left unfinished because of a lack of proper recording equipment at home, and rehearsals with other members are being temporarily put on hold.   Her sister and drummer Mia Schmier also said the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 has caused a lot of psychological stress, as she is constantly worrying about sanitation even in familiar environments.  &#8220;I would go in and sanitize the whole studio even though I know I'm the only one who's been in it, just in case,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That's a precaution I never really thought I'd have to use when practicing my own drum.&#8221;  But the nerve-wracking reality has also made her cherish her health, family and producers even more than she did before, Mia Schmier said. Regardless, there is still a looming uncertainty with regard to their future, Sydney Schmier said, since there is no telling of how venues will operate even when the stay-at-home orders are lifted.  To note, a recent  study  done by Performance Research and Full Circle Research Co. predicts a possible attendance drop for concerts and other entertainment venues. Of the respondents, 44% said they would go to fewer major events and 63% would have increased concerns over health safety. But there is also some hope, with 53% respondents having a &#8220;pent-up desire&#8221; to go to events that they have missed.  In the meantime, artists like Love You Later and Stereo Jane are trying to reconnect with their audiences through livestream performances and social media. Aviles said overusing these platforms can promote negative and self-destructive thoughts, but technology is the only way for many to communicate with others in the current conditions.  But some artists are finding other outlets for creative expression and human interaction. Bonnie Bloomgarden, the vocalist for the rock band Death Valley Girls, said her group has been unable to get together because of safety concerns, so their collaborative process has been replaced with more contained and personal recording sessions. She said the group has avoided playing a stripped down set online because its artistic identity is based on playing live on stage.  &#8220;It's not like being an actor where you have something coming out a year later,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is instantaneous and you feed off of everyone&#8217;s palpable energy. It&#8217;s like a religious experience.&#8221;   [Related:    Second Take: Cancellations of concerts are upsetting enough, Ticketmaster shouldn&#8217;t make it worse   ]   The band had previously been preparing for a break from touring before quarantine took place, so she said its members were already brainstorming workarounds to engage with their audience and sustain themselves. So far, the group has been making visual art pieces and thinking of selling them on Patreon, and Bloomgarden said she has personally ventured into other means of artistic expression such as essay writing to keep her grounded.   Slowing down has forced everyone to reevaluate their feelings and priorities, and there are certain days worse than others in this coping process &#8211; much like the stages of grief, she said. And with COVID-19 making plans up in the air, many artists can only await a more promising future when they can connect with people through a shared musical experience once again.  &#8220;This situation is like a ball at the end of the cliff,&#8221; Bloomgarden said. &#8220;It either falls or it stays, but it's not going to be on the tip forever. Everything will be OK.&#8221; ",['cap-alyson-kong'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/04/web.ae_.concertvenues.JHan_.5.jpg

And for all of us, coping can be difficult. But it&#8217;s undeniable that less privileged demographics are not only bearing the brunt of this crisis, they&#8217;re also enduring trauma outside of the pandemic.   For groups like essential workers, who are suffering the same universal lack of normalcy while juggling intensified societal burdens, coping becomes a much more difficult issue. On top of that, we must remind ourselves that   Black workers are  more likely to be in front-line jobs  categorized as essential.  In light of this, UCLA recently partnered with Beyonc&#233;'s  BeyGOOD  to launch  STAND Together During COVID-19 , a new web-based initiative that offers mental health resources specific to the demands of the pandemic.  By offering mental health support angled toward underrepresented groups, UCLA&#8217;s partnership with BeyGOOD suggests that the university is ready to bid farewell to the one-size-fits-all approach that has failed to address the diverse needs of Angelenos.  However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Experiencing racism &#8211; whether or not it&#8217;s during the pandemic &#8211; is a form of trauma. And UCLA&#8217;s mental health officials must start treating it like one.   UCLA must use this partnership as the beginning of a more effective mental health support structure for historically marginalized Bruins by offering specialized mental expertise beyond the pandemic. It could start by providing students important tools and healthy coping mechanisms specific to the various challenges racial minorities face on a daily basis.  Especially right now, as  protestors have taken to the streets  to voice their outrage at the murder and maltreatment of Black citizens, UCLA must acknowledge and support its Black Bruins.  Because sadly, the effects of the pandemic are not equal across different communities. They're a stark reminder of preexisting inequalities that will continue long after the pandemic &#8211; and the protesting &#8211;   is over.  Michelle Popowitz, assistant vice chancellor for research and executive director of UCLA Grand Challenges, said in an emailed statement UCLA&#8217;s interests were aligned with BeyGOOD in wanting to provide services for groups who may not have access to resources for addressing coronavirus-related anxiety, stress and depression.  &#8220;The Depression Grand Challenge leaders recognized that there would be a great unmet need and that UCLA had expertise that could be leveraged to make a difference,&#8221; Popowitz said.   Popowitz is right. Many students, from all backgrounds, are struggling right now.  Mitch Mologne, a third-year physiological science student, said living at home for the first time since high school has created a heightened sense of anxiety. However, because of the pandemic, he said he must now deal with these feelings without having access to normal outlets, like going to the gym or hanging out with friends.  And for some students, UCLA&#8217;s efforts have been helpful in tackling mental health challenges. Its newly minted  toolkits , for example, provide some with a new way to deal with anxiety and stress.  Melanie Tu, a third-year computational systems and biology student, said she has borderline personality disorder and has felt lonely and unfocused during isolation.  ""It's been hard,"" Tu said. ""But it feels good that UCLA is being so proactive.""  And UCLA&#8217;s outreach has done more than just addressing the masses. It has taken a stance as an ally to groups further marginalized by the societal response to the pandemic.  In Chancellor Gene Block&#8217;s email announcing the initiative, he emphasized the relationship between race and the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Block said UCLA's intentions align with BeyGOOD's goal of providing necessary mental health services to underrepresented groups throughout the pandemic.   Block sent another email regarding the Black Lives Matter protests thats was signed by other university leaders, stating UCLA's unequivocal support and revitalized commitment to ensuring that the administration's polices and actions reflect their value of all students.   It&#8217;s fitting that UCLA decided to join in on BeyGOOD&#8217;s initiative at this time. The intersection of mental health and demographic-specific support can help uplift those who need it the most &#8211; which, in turn, will benefit the entire Bruin community.  Because yes, mental health affects us all. But it&#8217;s imperative to recognize the differences in pressures, resources and norms across different communities.  Antoniel Carter, a third-year African American studies student, said she finds UCLA&#8217;s angled focus on mental health commendable.   &#8220;It&#8217;s a topic we&#8217;ve talked about before, but their focus on it at this time is really crucial,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And knowing that Beyonc&#233; is behind it. It provides greater visibility to the fact that mental health affects Black people too. Mental health affects people of color too.&#8221;   However, elevated anxieties for racial minorities are not exclusive to the pandemic. And while UCLA has taken great strides toward supporting Bruins of color, it needs to do more &#8211; especially once some normalcy resumes.  &#8220;Depression can be deadly for Black people, not just in the scope of depression itself but also how they might portray that depression,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;It might look different, and they might be criminalized for their reaction to it.&#8221;   Joining forces with BeyGOOD marks an important step in the university's efforts to address mental health. But more importantly, this new partnership can set the foundation for long-term mental health support that can expand available resources to historically marginalized students on campus.  &#8220;I&#8217;d want to see money invested into this,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;There&#8217;s so many subpopulations that could benefit from this, but the resources need to be there.&#8221;  A group-specific approach will certainly require ample resources. It will entail more funding toward programs like the  Depression Grand Challenge  in order to provide specific expertise to diverse subgroups.  And for a school of over 41,000 students, this method can sound dauntingly pricey.   But if UCLA wants to see a positive impact on Bruins' mental health, it will have to accept the cost and set aside the necessary resources to help students. Besides, it has already shifted gears toward support that reflects timely struggles.  To pump the brakes once the pandemic and protesting end would be a sad disservice to the thousands of students who continually face crippling inequalities.   UCLA must support Black students as they continually suffer trauma in many areas. To stay silent would be a loud statement against equality, and to fail to act would support systemic racism within our own university.   COVID-19 certainly has broken down many basic blocks of life. But now, UCLA has a chance to rebuild some of them more thoughtfully.  And at the very least, UCLA should offer adequate mental health support to the groups that shoulder greater burdens not just in times of crisis but in everyday life.   Because Black mental health matters. ",['cap-isabel-weinerth'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/op.gradissue.weinerth.beygoodinitiative-1024x780.jpg

Justin, a third-year world arts and cultures student, said when he auditioned for this years Spring Sing, he dreamed of creating the ultimate live performance. This vision would be realized through the addition of a drummer, keyboardist, bassist and guitarist   to his previously solo sound. He said the instrumental layering over his track Too Close brought a sense   of individuality through the nuance of the musicians' styles. And although the group's song will not be presented on a stage, Justin said the instrumentalists' flare still translates through their improvised portions that made the cut for the final recording.  I am a solo artist, but I just love collaborating with other talented individuals, he said. When I saw the opportunity to perform at Spring Sing, I wanted to be able to incorporate a real concert feel  so I formed a band.  When the band started rehearsing together, Justin said he and his four other bandmates took a relaxed approach. Instead of tediously planning out every aspect of Too Close, each member was allowed to improvise with their instrument over the basic chords of the song. In one instance, Justin said his guitarist added in his own guitar solo, which ended up playing a crucial role in diversifying the song, giving it some partially rock-oriented   moments. Combining similar moments of instrumental freedom across all of the members work in the track gives it a sonically rounded feel, he said.  I love the idea of live instruments, which is very uncommon nowadays, Justin said. Being that the song has keyboard, piano, electric guitar, bass and drums, I really wanted (each instrument) to come alive, and that's when everyone else came into the picture.  But it is Justins intuitive songwriting style that leads the bands instrumental contributions, said Sebastian Feo-Lacau, the groups drummer and producer. Feo-Lacau said when Justin writes, he already has ideas for the songs beat rattling in his head, quickly   vocalizing them to put a song together.  Feo-Lacau has worked with Justin in the past, so he said adjusting to produce   a bands plurality of instruments as opposed to a single artists ideas required a new mindset. In this experimental way of thinking, Feo-Lacau said he had to open up the layering of the song to let each instrumentalist be heard. The end result offers a multitude of live recorded playing styles from each musician, as opposed to being something that sounds more passive and blended,   he said.  I was listening to some of the lyrics that (Justin) wrote and some of the melodies that he already had, and we went from there, Feo-Lacau said. We started building the song up and making the beats. We just took the main ideas of the track and started to flesh things out and how it would sound live.  To achieve a sound that mimics a live experience, Justins keyboardist Jane Shin, a second-year English student, said each band member took their time   individually   recording over the basic song mix. She said the separate recording time allowed them to control where they can improvise without being influenced by other members ad-libs. The combined recordings came together to create a unified, cohesive sound, Shin said,   while   their recording format gave   them the opportunity to offer their own creative contributions.  Our rehearsal felt a lot more like a jam session than practicing for an audition, she said. As soon as you do put that pressure on, then it becomes a lot less fun. ... We all love music and we all love playing instruments and singing with other people, so (the band) came together very naturally.  The unified feel of the instrumentals in Too Close is meant to elicit positive feelings in listeners, Shin said. Although Justin wrote the track about a potential relationship gone wrong, she said the tracks improvised guitar solo    along with upbeat drums and playful chord progressions    create an optimistic listening experience. She said Justins belting vocals act as a duet between his voice and the frequent guitar riffs, but they also help paint the bright perception of the track.  Too Closes"" duality between its sound and lyrical content   guides listeners to its final message. The song encourages that while love may be something most people want, everyone should take a step back and explore what makes them happy, Justin said. And for him and the rest of his band, that happiness comes from the healing power stirred by creating, writing and playing music.  The good thing about music is it does definitely bring people together, Justin said. (Music) allows people to just sit in the moment and just feel whatever they're feeling. That's what we're all trying to do.",['cap-brooke-cuzick'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Calebjustin-1.jpg

Nearly three years later, I have finished my third and final year of editorship, outlasting every other member of the 2017-2018 News editor team.  Being underestimated and overlooked is nothing new to me. After all, nobody really expects much out of the small, quiet Asian girl who&#8217;s learned to stay in her lane for most of her life. I wish the rest of this column could be about how I defied these expectations at every turn, but the truth is, for the longest time, I barely even questioned them.  When a high school teacher hesitated to let me join the school&#8217;s Model United Nations club because he knew me as the quiet kid in class, I thought he was right, that maybe I just didn&#8217;t deserve this opportunity to try something new. When teachers overlooked me in favor of the more talkative and charismatic kids in class, I believed that maybe I just wasn&#8217;t good enough or smart enough for simply not being the loudest voice or the most commanding presence in the room.  Without even realizing it, I had internalized other people&#8217;s doubts about me and begun perceiving my own abilities through their eyes, never daring to think I was capable of so much more.  I joined the Daily Bruin as a News contributor my freshman year because I wanted to go back to doing the one thing I enjoyed that people had always told me I was good at &#8211; writing and telling stories. I never pictured myself doing anything more, but my confidence slowly grew with every story I published and every byline I earned.  The real catalyst of change was becoming an editor the following year. After six months of being a News contributor, I applied for an assistant editor role, even after hearing warnings of how painful the job was.  And they were right &#8211; being an assistant News editor was and still is the most difficult thing I had ever done in my life. The pressure that came with the grind of daily production and the knowledge that my actions and mistakes could have very real effects on the quality of the News page and the work of my colleagues was sometimes too much to bear. These were the times when I questioned whether I really deserved my place at the News desk.  But somewhere between all the stress dreams and late nights in the office, I discovered grit and tenacity within myself that I never knew existed. After all, if I could survive the humiliation of publicly being roasted at weekly budget meetings or withstand the pressure of stories constantly falling through, I could do anything.  When the time came again for everyone to identify their potential successors, I was once again overlooked. My top editor, as well as the rest of my colleagues, basically considered everybody else for the next year&#8217;s News editor before even thinking of me as a possibility, including someone from another section and a fellow assistant News editor who had already repeatedly expressed her disinterest.  To be honest, up until this point I hadn&#8217;t seriously considered going for the News editor position. Although I was passionate about the Daily Bruin, I wasn&#8217;t planning on pursuing journalism after graduation, and others had convinced me that sinking even more time into the paper wouldn&#8217;t be worth it.  However, when I saw I was being overlooked for the role, something pushed me to apply, regardless of what others thought I should or could do. For the first time in my life, I saw other people&#8217;s doubt in me as a challenge to rise to the occasion and make them see what I already saw in myself.  To quote author Chanel Miller, &#8220;Whenever I am underestimated, I think, you mistake my quietness for weakness. If you can&#8217;t imagine me on a stage, I&#8217;ll get on one.&#8221;  That's not to say my tenure as News editor was all smooth sailing. After all, I now stood at the helm of the most vital and demanding content section of the paper. And with the increase in responsibility and pressure, came the intermittent return of my self-doubt. But no matter how many times I tripped getting on that stage, I always picked myself back up, knowing I had a News section to run and, more importantly, a supportive and driven team of assistant editors to help along the way.    Witnessing the impact our reporting had on the UCLA community and seeing my assistant editors and contributors develop into talented journalists in their own rights was what kept me going. And it was ultimately what compelled me to remain on staff as an editor for a third year &#8211; this time managing the Enterprise section.   These past few years at the Daily Bruin have helped shape me into a more confident individual, someone who is fully aware her worth and ability are not dependent on the opinions of anybody else. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still struggle with making my voice heard at the table. But learning that I even belonged at the table in the first place, regardless of what others thought, was a monumental first step that has taken me a lifetime to reach.  My story is not unique. I have read countless -30- columns &#8211; many of them also written by women &#8211;  about not feeling smart enough, qualified enough or deserving enough in the newsroom.   But despite the looming shadow of imposter syndrome that has followed so many of us, we have all emerged from the halls of Kerckhoff 118 as stronger and more resilient people.  The Daily Bruin has taught me a lot of lessons that I will forever cherish. But the most important is that I don&#8217;t need other people to believe in me in order for me to believe in myself.

But what is life like from the perspective of one of these club members working on Bruin Walk?   Karishma Raghuram, a first-year statistics student, knows well what it is like to table and flier on Bruin Walk.  Raghuram is an intern for California Public Interest Research Group at UCLA, a student-led advocacy organization that lobbies for issues such as renewable energy, public health and hunger on college campuses.  One of the things that drew Raghuram to CALPIRG was its Plastic-Free Seas campaign, which advocates for clean oceans.  &#8220;Growing up in Orange County, these kinds of issues are on the forefront,&#8221; Raghuram said about ocean pollution.  Raghuram spends much of her time on Bruin Walk promoting CALPIRG and the many programs it supports.  Getting people to stop by the CALPIRG table is not about following a script but about being friendly and approachable to students passing by, Raghuram said.  Students are often willing to talk because the issues CALPIRG advocates for are issues students care about, Raghuram said. Although many people respond positively, Raghuram said she sometimes gets rejected as well.  &#8220;Totally,&#8221; Raghuram said. &#8220;All the time. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions.&#8221;  However, Raghuram said the important thing is that the organization is raising awareness for issues that matter.  Raghuram&#8217;s shifts vary depending on what event she is working. On Friday, she was working at a tabling event to raise awareness for food insecurity on campus and get people to sign a petition to commit UCLA to eliminate student hunger.  Raghuram&#8217;s shift ran from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. For the first half of the shift, she worked the table. Then, she spent the rest of the time on Bruin Walk with a clipboard asking students for signatures for the Zero Hunger petition.  The event was a joint effort between CALPIRG, the CalFresh Initiative at UCLA and the Challah for Hunger UCLA, said Kathryn Gonzalez-Valle, the vice chair of CALPIRG at UCLA and fourth-year history student.  The Zero Hunger petition had gained 1,400 signatures as of Friday afternoon and is projected to be at 1,500 by the end of the campaign, Gonzalez-Valle said.  On Friday, each volunteer was given a personal goal of 10 signatures every hour, said Keya Vijapure, a first-year physiological science student and CALPIRG volunteer.  Raghuram, who started as a CALPIRG volunteer week zero of fall quarter, is already an intern and is a pledge captain for the Plastic-Free Seas campaign.  One of the best things about working for CALPIRG is that being involved in the organization is a great way to implement social change, Raghuram said. It has also been vital to her personal growth, she added.  One of her favorite stories from her time working for CALPIRG was a conversation from a pledge drive, Raghuram said. She was talking to a student who was unsure about pledging.  What made the student change her mind was that she was pregnant and wanted her child to grow up in a better world, Raghuram said.

This interest grew even more last spring, when Reichners sister was diagnosed with Cushings disease. The illness affected her sister's heart rate, she said, making it difficult for them to interact outside of a calm environment. One of the ways they coped with this obstacle was by watercolor painting together, Reichner said.  ""Her heart rate was 140 when she was resting in bed. ... It was very difficult to even talk to her without her being at risk of having a heart attack,"" Reichner said. ""But when I visited her in the hospital, I would bring watercolor supplies and paper, and we would both paint and not speak. It would lower her heart rate and helped us be together in the same room.""   [Related:    Graduate student aims to inspire activism by uniting art, science in exhibit   ]     Reichner said she will never forget how beneficial creating art was for her sister. Witnessing how art helped her sister allowed Reichner to recognize that the medium could help individuals living with anxiety and depression, or those navigating their way through difficult situations such as her own. HART aims to provide this calm environment for UCLA students, especially as other clubs might not be well known or accessible to everyone, she said.  As a new club, the two main things that are most important to us are accessibility and awareness about mental health,"" Reichner said.  On top of acknowledging the gaps within these self-care organizations, members of HART recognize the limitations of counseling centers, therapy and other services provided by UCLA. Second-year neuroscience student Michelle Kim, who is currently applying to become vice president of the club, said these resources limit the time students have with professionals.  Because of these constraints, HART aims to eliminate the burden of time and financial restraints, allowing students to feel heard and welcome within a community of others who are there for similar reasons, Reichner said. Existing organizations and programs may not be accessible to every student on campus, Kim said.    Some of the resources at school that are supposed to be geared toward mental health and helping people who have anxiety or depression arent exactly the best, Kim said. For example, there are a certain amount of appointments that you are limited to, and you have to pay after that.    Although creating different forms of art is a major focus in the club, Reichner said it is especially important to incorporate education about every avenue of mental health. Such dual focus will help the club's members work toward improvement, as they will possess the tools necessary to cope with difficult emotions in the future, she said.  To do so, Reichner said she hopes to implement mental health education into each weekly meeting or event by focusing on specific topics in workshops. More importantly, Reichner said she wants to invite mental health professionals to help provide further guidance for the club's members. In addition to these guest speakers, Reichner said meetings would include several activity stations where the professional's tips could be put in action. These activity stations would include step-by-step art projects, as well as free time to create anything participants want.  We want to focus on educating others about how to help themselves and how to help others while doing an activity together, Reichner said. Of course, it would be great to have members of the club go home with something that they created, but I want to make sure they go home with something learned as well.   [Related:    Stress Less: Painting can help students brush up on how to relax from school life   ]   Second-year music history and industry student Paige Shannon, who is applying to become a member of the club's executive board, became interested in HART because of her personal experiences with art therapy. She uses music as her preferred outlet, with songwriting preventing her from bottling in all of her emotions. Writing her thoughts out on paper allowed her to feel relief. Shannon said she believes art is the perfect vehicle for exercising self-reflection without being judged.  Although HART focuses on a niche group of people and explores one of the many ways students can cope with difficult situations, the club welcomes anyone interested in mental health awareness, Shannon said. The club hopes to create a space wherein students can destress within a community of like-minded members with the incorporation of both awareness and artistic activities.  ""You can create something and still feel the same satisfaction and emotional release from it without expecting to be the next Picasso,"" Shannon said. ""Especially on a college campus where people are very competitive and stressed, taking a moment away from that to sit with yourself and reflect can teach you a lot.""",['cap-julie-lee'],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ae_.hart_.KM_.jpg

The weeklong program for high school students, which begins Monday, will be taught online by graduates of UCLA's Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz Performance as well as campus faculty. Emma Dayhuff, a recent graduate from the Herbie Hancock Institute, said the  intensive will cover a variety of topics spanning from improvisation and composition to jazz history and practice techniques. But the intensive is not as strict as a typical classroom &#8211;   Dayhuff said high school students with varying levels of familiarity with jazz are welcome to participate in daily private lessons and group workshops that  teach universally applicable music theories.  &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be focusing on ... exciting students to want to learn more on their own &#8211; both during the intensive and after,&#8221; Dayhuff said. &#8220;We're going to be working on doing (active) listening, connecting things like emotion to sound and harmonic colors.&#8221;   Dayhuff will be teaching alongside Malachi Whitson, a recent graduate of the   Herbie   Hancock Institute, who will be holding a technology class and one-on-one sessions for drum players. Since quarantine has had an effect on almost all musicians who rely on performance for income, Whitson said he is planning to focus on tangible skills like audio and video software usage. He hopes these abilities will prepare budding musicians for outstanding situations that may limit their performance careers, such as the stay-at-home order.   [Related:    Jazz quintet Banned uses music to explore meanings of liberation   ]   While reaching multiple skill levels and teaching tangible skills are important to the group, Whitson said the intensive will also   explore the universality of music by concentrating on diverse, global  jazz forms. The program will specifically focus on Irish, Afro-Cuban and African American music  to teach students about the various roots and influences that make up jazz composition. The faculty aim to emphasize the universality within global music by focusing on improvisation, he said.  &#8220;Improvisation exists in all countries in some shape or another,&#8221; Whitson said. &#8220;There are some fundamental things ... that most artists need to know ... like reading notation or understanding harmony, but we want to investigate how that relates to other countries (by) ... pointing out connections and investigating those within the realm of improvisation.&#8221;  But improvisation is only one aspect of the intensive, said Roni Eytan, another graduate of the institute. There will also be special emphasis placed on composition and students will be encouraged to write their own pieces as a final project. This goal is only the beginning for students, however, as Eytan said he hopes the program can be a stepping stone to greater musical endeavors.  &#8220;Obviously (the intensive is) very short, but it will start a process (of) encouragement,&#8221; Eytan said. &#8220;In my experience with short intensives, (momentum is) initiated that can be valuable in the long term for writing, composing, playing and improvising (jazz).&#8221;   [Related:    Jazz student, ensemble strike a chord with expressive and experimental tunes   ]   Although stay at home orders have created special circumstances for many jazz musicians, Herbie Hancock Institute graduate Lenard Simpson said he is hoping to spark a passion for composition within the students, even in times when performances cannot be held live. A lack of person-to-person contact makes teaching music a challenge since so much of it depends on tactile physical presence between a student and teacher, but he said he hopes to utilize video performances to express more complex ideas without the help of physical examples.   The final day of the intensive will culminate in a video or audio showcase of the participants' compositions for the rest of the class to view. Although there are plans to teach both universally applicable musical theories and tangible audio software, Simpson said he ultimately hopes to continue a jazz tradition by passing down knowledge from generation to generation.  &#8220;We give them information ... but knowledge without wisdom is pointless,&#8221; Simpson said. &#8220;If  (students) have their own profound experience then we&#8217;ve done our job and that begins to trickle down because ... now they might be inspired to tell someone else.&#8221; ",['cap-tara-oldenburg'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/jazzinstitute.png

But instead of opening up conversation or negotiations, the UC responded with a show of force.  UC President Janet Napolitano denied the demands and legitimacy of the strikes in  a letter  Feb. 14. She expressed sympathy regarding the high cost of living and described a proposed solution of a $2,500 need-based housing fellowship and a doctoral student funding program, alongside working with policymakers to break ground on faster construction of student housing.  But with an empty promise also came a now-fulfilled threat.       Napolitano's half-hearted condolences prefaced a warning for graduate students, which referenced the potential consequence of termination. And it lived up to those words &#8211; 54 grad students at UCSC were  fired  this week.   Regardless, the momentum is spreading, and  UCLA&#8217;s own  graduate student body held its first official strike Wednesday, putting employment on the line just for a chance at a living wage. And on Thursday they voted to go on strike starting next week provided graduate students in at least 10 departments agree to participate.   The UC&#8217;s decision to fire employees calling for a conversation   denies the student body the respect and rights to civil disobedience it deserves. It is clear that the costs of living and the livelihood of the graduate student body are an afterthought in the wake of the strike &#8211; the University's primary response is one of punishment. And at a University that espouses the values of free speech, Napolitano and the UC are hypocritical in their decision to jeopardize or terminate the jobs of students and workers.  Simply put, it&#8217;s a nearsighted response to a greater systemic problem.  Currently, UC-employed grad students are paid $21,000 annually, on average, putting them below the estimated  required living wage  in Santa Cruz.   In an emailed statement from UC Office of the President spokesperson Andrew Gordon, he said   the wildcat   strike is viewed by the University as a violation and unofficial action against the previously signed agreement.  Citing a 3% wage increase and 17,000 new beds under Napolitano&#8217;s tenure, Gordon highlighted the work already being done to ameliorate the housing and cost of living crisis across campuses and expressed hope for engaging in &#8220;meaningful and thoughtful discussion.""  Apparently the UC and its president think holding student job security hostage is a good bargaining chip.  And rest assured, they would prefer to remove the platform for discussion entirely.   The lack of willingness to discuss is not just a problem for the strikers at UCSC. It's a problem here too.  Zak Fisher, the UCLA Graduate Students Association president, said that the administration at UCLA is also resistant to making any changes.  &#8220;From the administrators that I&#8217;ve met with and talked to, none of them have been able to give me a response to my questions,&#8221; Fisher said.  The resistance to discussion is continuously met with more aggression, creating a greater atmosphere of conflict.   &#8220;These meetings also have had an insane police presence too, even though there was no insinuation at all that it was anything more than just a discussion,&#8221; Fisher said.  No university has the right to blackmail its students out of their right to free speech, much less by threatening their already measly compensation. UC graduate students have expressed their intent to create a stage for discussion &#8211; but their university seems perfectly fine building a battleground at the first sign of civil disobedience.  And the UC has even distorted the COLA movement's messaging to its own student body.   Tyanna Slobe, a graduate student at UCLA and social media director for Ucla4Cola, said in the wake of the strike the administration has allegedly taken other actions to attempt to de-escalate the effects of the strikes.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of actions taken to stifle the word about COLA,""   Slobe said. ""Some RAs were told to tell their residents that the protests were violent demonstrations and to avoid them.""  The UC and Napolitano have done exceptionally well in their attempts to quash the strikes. At this rate, it does not appear that a discussion will come without severe and irreversible repercussions. But it remains unbecoming of one of California&#8217;s greatest educational institutions to respond to the voices and concerns of its students by terminating them.   The wildcat strike itself does indeed violate the original terms of agreement negotiated between the United Automobile Workers Local 2865 and the UC. Regardless of the fine print, it is not necessarily an illegal protest and should not be met with the force of one. Although a strike may not be the standard protocol for negotiations, the University has no reason to retaliate in such a manner.  If the University wants to ethically and maturely resist the terms of bargaining, it should do so by having an official discussion to review the current agreement with the strikers until the next official strike can be held.   After all, these grad students aren't trying to bite the hand that&#8217;s feeding them.

Since quarantine began, I have longed for crowds of people and picnics on a bustling Janss Steps. However, I&#8217;ve simultaneously found comfort in the stillness and solitude of my suburban backyard. For some, home has become a marker of comfort and security &#8211; reminding us that, at the end of the day, we're ""safer at home.""   But I began to wonder: Could this word, with so many implications and connotations, mean the same thing to everyone?  In an attempt to answer this, I set out to ask all types of students &#8211; from in-state locals to international students, and graduating seniors to   resident assistants &#8211; what home means to them to try to better understand the word and all of its complex, unconventional, dividing and unifying definitions.  To begin with, I found that along with this question of home, each student faces a corresponding   question of how UCLA was or still is a part of their journey to define it.   Adin Ryssdal, a first-year political science student, said UCLA is ""a home,"" but not ""the     home"" he considers La Ca&#241;ada Flintridge, California, to be.   Given his mere two quarters at UCLA, this dichotomy between   ""a   home"" and ""the   home"" is a product of not feeling completely set at UCLA, Ryssdal said. Ryssdal acknowledged that a sense of social belonging, which could make UCLA ""the home,"" comes with time and experience &#8211; two things Ryssdal and most first-years don't quite have.  Ryssdal longed for a common space during his first year &#8211; a couch, room or table where roommates or friends could gather and decompress. Ryssdal felt that unlike the kitchen counter he and his high school friends in La Ca&#241;ada would tell stories around for hours, his dorm experience   lacked an essence of community gathering compared to   other dorm styles.  Similarly, resident assistant and third-year   statistics student Andy Shen also   spoke about   the struggle of cultivating a sense of community, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.  &#8220;Definitions of home drastically change when we have situations like these, because ... the amount of interaction you get is limited,&#8221; Shen said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t get that wider community interaction that you would call home.&#8221;   Community and belonging seemed out of reach when the year was cut short by a quarter, Shen said. Nevertheless, Shen believes in the power of optimism during this time, and even more in the power of looking out for one another and of checking in with friends during times of need.  Ideas of home like Shen's remind us that, for many people, what constitutes a home extends beyond what any four walls could contain. It reminds us that our relationships and obligations to one another extend beyond any physical space, too.   Ruthie Glauber, a second-year environmental science   student, is a personification of Shen's message about keeping friends close.   Understanding that places are often temporary, Glauber said that she doesn't emotionally attach herself to   places; instead, she values the connections to the people there.   Glauber&#8217;s belief about the impermanence of places stems from the frequent and drastic relocations she has experienced throughout her life. She was born in Tennessee, but has lived in Belgium, France, Amsterdam and London. Halfway through her senior year of high school, her parents relocated to Seattle, and Glauber made a temporary home out of her boarding school before moving to Los Angeles.   Now, amid the pandemic, Glauber and her family have freshly moved to Arizona. However, Glauber continues to call UCLA home with pride.   &#8220;The fact that I got to pick UCLA and choose to move to California ... is a huge aspect of me being able to call it my own home,&#8221; Glauber said. &#8220;Because I wanted it to be, not because I was forced to.""  For the first time in her life, Glauber had the authority and privilege to claim a place as her own. However, she hasn't forgotten the places, or people, before UCLA: She transports a little of each place with her by carrying scrapbooks of nostalgic photos and prioritizing catching up with friends around the world.   The presence of friends seems to be a common thread when designating a place as home. As a result, the absence of friends disrupts what many students would have called home a few months ago.   Fourth-year geography and environmental studies student Hailey Mylett, who is a few weeks away from graduating, knows this absence a bit too well.   &#8220;I felt really at home at my apartment in Westwood when my friends lived there, but now that it&#8217;s empty, it doesn&#8217;t really feel like home anymore,&#8221; Mylett said.   Mylett just returned to LA from Cleveland, a place she is deeply proud to be from: It holds her father&#8217;s side of the family, high school best friends and Cavaliers games, all of which Mylett considers to be crucial aspects of home.   &#8220;It&#8217;s a little community we have, especially in my little town of Rocky River,&#8221; Mylett said.   But after being physically separated from her hometown, Mylett transitioned back to her Westwood apartment with difficulty. Without roommates, in-person classes or post-graduation plans, she regretted leaving her family in Ohio.   &#8220;I freaked out a little bit. ... I almost felt trapped,&#8221; Mylett said.   Nevertheless, this initial discomfort led her to a realization of sorts. Mylett said she understands her future will hold many difficult transitions, like this one, and is accepting   that living with others isn&#8217;t a permanent reality. She   also said that she is making the best of this uncomfortable learning experience by seeking normalcy.   Of course, normalcy looks different for different people. For Mylett, it is the comfort of having a morning routine that she can take with her wherever she goes &#8211; from Cleveland to LA and to any future destination.   As quarantine requires students like Mylett to adapt to home in a new context, it also   reminds other students, like second-year neuroscience student Ananya Shankar, that the challenge of acclimating to new environments is no new feat.     Shankar is an international student from south India, a home that offered her 18 years of friendship and support.   &#8220;These were the kind of people I could say and do anything with ... and leaving that was the hardest thing ever,&#8221; Shankar said.  Ultimately, by expanding her social circle, stepping outside of her comfort zone and practicing acts of kindness at UCLA, Shankar has cultivated a home in the   United States &#8211; one she didn&#8217;t want to leave once the COVID-19 pandemic hit.   In fact, Shankar didn't leave for India. However, this wasn't her choice &#8211; she couldn't   leave.   &#8220;They blocked the borders for all (Overseas Citizens of India) a few days before I could fly out,&#8221; Shankar said.    Supported by her UCLA community, Shankar lived temporarily in   the houses of several family members and friends over   the last few months. She first stayed in San Diego with a friend, then in San Jose with her old roommate and finally in Seattle with her aunt.   Despite all this moving around, Shankar emphasized that her experience as an international student was influential in shaping how she views the process of making new places her home. In this way, not only has Shankar grown from previous changes, but she is equipped for them in the future as well.   Abbey Saeger, a second-year cognitive science student, faces a similar situation &#8211; she has been with her girlfriend&#8217;s family in Sacramento for most of the quarantine. However, Saeger said she grew up in two different homes just outside of Dallas instead of one.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had just one home ... because my parents have been divorced forever,&#8221; Saeger said. &#8220;When I moved across the country (to UCLA), it was just another home.&#8221;   Now, Saeger said she has a fourth home in Sacramento, except this time it is not a place, but a person: her girlfriend, Jaime.   &#8220;I&#8217;ve never really felt like anyone was home before ... and that definitely shifted when I met her,&#8221; Saeger said.    According to the many UCLA students I spoke with, home may not be a permanent house or even a house at all. Rather, home is an ever-changing combination of comfort, normalcy and most   importantly, people.   Though what home means to me may not be what home means to you or to any of these other   students, one aspect of home remains the same for all of us: It moves us to believe that we belong.

At this years Spring Sing, Talandis and Ambrose will perform their original composition The River. The pop ballad uses lyrics inspired by their life experiences        like experiences with social anxiety or finding hope at the end of a rough day    as they spin a narrative around a trip to the river that helps someone start the day over, Talandis said.  This (song) is about going to the river, feeling so much self-doubt, feeling lost and finding a way to cope and manage, Ambrose said. Theres sort of several phases that we all go through, but ultimately we find hope.  Talandis, a third-year human biology and society student, began writing the lyrics to The River immediately after attending Spring Sing as a first-year. Although Talandis considered bringing his song to the stage last year, he had no one to accompany his vocals. After he met Ambrose through the HOOLIGAN Theatre Company, they began to piece the song together, with Ambrose creating a piano accompaniment. Both from Chicago, the duo met over the winter break to work on their composition.  I knew (Ambrose) was the type of person I wanted to create something with,"" Talandis said. ""I heard him play my song, how it sounded in my head, for the first time out loud.  The pair wanted to focus on writing lyrics that were personal to them but can still be applicable to many people, Ambrose said. At one point, Talandis sings, You can scream out loud for no one but the voices in your head, which Ambrose said reflects his own experience with social anxiety. Despite the personal origins of the lyrics, however, the first-year theater student said the words can also reflect more general feelings of self-doubt.  The river reflects Talandis own happy place, which he finds when being outside in nature.   However, the river is meant to represent the listeners own place of emotional serenity  whether that be physical, emotional or in a memory. The image of going down to a river with stones can carry both negative and positive associations, Talandis said. The listener can decide if the song's speaker is leaving the stones at the riverbank or entering the water with them, ultimately leaving them   to choose if the song is hopeful or not.  The main image, whatever you get out of it, is a place, and that place is going to be different for everybody,"" Talandis said. ""That place is supposed to bring you to a point where hopefully youll experience that optimism and come out of a bad day better, but that might not happen for everybody.  Talandis said his own style of music draws from a variety of inspirations, ranging from rock to gospel. But more than his musical stylings, when performing the song, what Talandis said he thinks about his own place of mental clarity: his familys lake house in Wisconsin.   Its isolated location allows him to reflect internally without the distractions of day-to-day life, as well as reconnect with a sense of optimism, Talandis said.  Fourth-year    geography student Jaya Mapleton said the songs upbeat tempo   makes her think of warm colors, speaking to the variety of invocations that can be made from the same imagery. Mapleton said the songs pop roots  similar to songs by Hozier or Bishop Briggs  is atypical of Spring Sing duet acts, which she said tend to be less upbeat.  The song aims to bring people together during this time of social distancing and global uncertainty, Ambrose said. By believing that the sun will rise every day or that winter always ends, Talandis said nature offers a way to find hope even in the worst of times.  I think the main connection between nature and optimism is the idea that you can be a part of it and remove yourself from any distractions and just really be connected with yourself and your emotions and nothing else,"" Talandis said.",['cap-hannah-ferguson'],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Jetandxander-1.jpg

The reality of calling myself a UCLA student has yet to fully settle in.   Growing up in Los Angeles, I would occasionally read the Daily Bruin. But, throughout all of those years, I never once thought I would eventually write for the newspaper.  Joining the Daily Bruin was one of the best choices I&#8217;ve made at UCLA. Being a student journalist led me to learn more about myself and the university through opportunities and experiences caused directly by the student-run organization.  If I could go back in time, I would still apply to join the Daily Bruin. The only thing I would change about the experience would be applying earlier than a minute before the deadline. I still have no clue how I started and finished the Daily Bruin application within two hours and still landed an interview with the newspaper.  As a writer for the Arts &amp; Entertainment section, I&#8217;ve experienced the abstract and amazing artistic side to UCLA I never thought possible. From attending theatrical performances at the Geffen Playhouse to observing museum exhibits in the Fowler Museum, I learned more about the field of arts during my time at the Daily Bruin than I ever had before.  The best feeling on campus is picking up a copy of the Daily Bruin from a newsstand and seeing your article in the paper. It&#8217;s an even better feeling when your story makes the front page. Seeing my published work in person made all of the late night writing efforts and endless editing sessions with the editors worth it.  While I won&#8217;t miss transcribing interviews with subjects that ranged from five minutes to an hour, I will never forget the stories I&#8217;ve heard. Learning about the creative projects UCLA students take on inspires me to reach outside my own comfort zone. It&#8217;s amazing to see how many students simultaneously manage schoolwork and their artistic endeavors.  I apologize to my former dorm roommates for all the late nights I would attempt, but fail, to silently come back into our room after editing articles in our floor&#8217;s lounge. I also ask for forgiveness for keeping a large, messy stack of newspapers with my articles in them right on my desk. But, I thank you for waking me up for my first interview with the Daily Bruin and all the positive feedback you&#8217;ve given me about my published works.  I will miss my fellow A&amp;E friends. To the writers who still have more time left at UCLA, I look forward to reading your Daily Bruin articles and cheering on your journalistic growth over time. Until we meet in Westwood again, I will be celebrating your efforts from afar.  Exploring your creative side can be intimidating and uncomfortable. But, making mistakes and learning from them is what being an undergraduate student is about. Even if exploring your creative side breaks unwritten social norms, at least you can say you tried to express your personal passions.  If you&#8217;re a continuing student at UCLA, it isn&#8217;t too late to take on new opportunities. And, if you are a graduating student such as myself, know the same notion also applies to you.

Years later, the artist would work with Jepsens frequent collaborator Kyle Shearer to produce her 2020 single Bad Friend  which pays homage to that very night. Describing her Cambridge graduation trip to Tokyo, Bad Friend exemplifies Sawayamas genre-melding approach to expressing her intersectional identity as a queer, Japanese British pop star. Her most recent critically acclaimed album SAWAYAMA traverses continents as well as genres, with its songs acting as redolent, timely snapshots of the artists ever-evolving relationship with her surroundings.  In the track Akasaka Sad, Sawayama frames her introspection between trap beats and strings as she strays from Tokyo to the solitude of a nondescript hotel  only to find her depression has followed her there. The albums lyrics, refusing to be singularly internal, also extend to broader, societal issues. Lead single XS satirizes the compulsive tendencies of Western capitalism to a distinctly '90s bubblegum pop beat. Meanwhile, STFU!  whose grinding, nu metal angst is the Korn and Evanescence collaboration that never happened  critiques the frequent misrepresentation of Asian women as servient and submissive.  However, with her metamorphic, avant-garde image and explosive vocals, Sawayama is anything but.   - Kaia Sherry    [Related:    Music Preview: Rising artists span genres and embrace lyrical depth in recent releases   ]     [caption id=""attachment_385980"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""696""]  (Courtesy of Mark Peaced)[/caption]   RMR   Nobody knew who RMR was until he put on the ski mask.  And they still dont.  The vocalist is a mysterious figure to the general public  although maybe not so much to those within the hip-hop industry  whose viral rise can be largely attributed to the  music video  for his debut song, RASCAL. The visuals indicate a standard fare aesthetic for a trap music video, while the song heavily interpolates country group Rascal Flatts Bless The Broken Road. Though the rampant country influence in RMRs vocal references weaves through the songs evident trap lyrics, this isnt another case of Old Town Road.  That is, little siblings wont be echoing RMRs lyrics like they did Lil Nas Xs.  The enigma released an EP June 12 entitled DRUG DEALING IS A LOST ART, with a song produced by the acclaimed Timbaland and boasting features from established artists like Lil Baby, Future and Westside Gunn. Live piano and guitar instrumentation with a western twang clash with thumping Atlanta-esque trap drums throughout the EP  the contrasting sounds mirror a plight in RMRs lyrics as his plunge into the world of drug dealing has afforded him a newfound lifestyle of opulence.  The ever-so-curious rap fan might ask who exactly RMR is to have these types of connections in the hip-hop industry with only nine songs to his name, or why hes so intent on withholding his identity by being intentionally vague in interviews.  But in the meantime, hell just let his music do the talking.   - EJ Panaligan   [caption id=""attachment_385981"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""671""]  (Creative Commons photo by Bruce Baker via Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]   Catfish and the Bottlemen   Bold and brash, Catfish and the Bottlemen is blazing onto the indie rock scene.  The Welsh band made its debut with its 2014 album, The Balcony, a lyrically raw yet sonically robust blast of garage rock that is loaded to the brim with feisty electric guitar solos. Backed by aggressive percussion, the album delivers gritty instrumentals and occasionally crude lyrics that earned the release a top 10 spot on the UK Albums Chart.  Though often characterized by its more fiery songs, Catfish and the Bottlemens discography boasts more tenderness than the bands signature spunk may convey. Several tracks from its debut album are lush with gentle guitar strumming and textured by sweet lyrics. In Hourglass, lead vocalist Van McCann softly croons Im craving your calls like a soldiers wife, dreamily yearning after someone who is slipping out of his grasp like sand.  Five years after the bands debut, such fragility remains evident in their most recent album, The Balance, which also hints at concrete emotional growth. While the lead single, Longshot, remains grounded in the groups garage rock roots, McCann belts And we lapped it up and were wise enough to know, alluding to the bands maturation after its rise to notoriety  an ascent that will surely continue with time and future releases.

The North Westwood Neighborhood Council, an organization that represents Westwood Village and UCLA to the Los Angeles City Council, granted neighborhood purpose grants for a computer aide at the Westwood Library, a compost program at the Farmers' Market and a homelessness outreach event.  The council unanimously granted $5,000 to Friends of Westwood Library, a nonprofit that fundraises for the Westwood Library. The grant will partially fund the $20,000-a-year wage for a computer aide at the library.  Sam Yebri, a FWL board member, said the computer aide would help vulnerable communities by creating resumes, using office software, setting up emails, downloading e-books and more.  &#8220;We call the computer aide a cybernaut,&#8221; Yebri said. &#8220;(The aide helps) with things that for many of us may be routine, but for the people that use this library, including folks who are unsheltered, justice-involved, veterans, seniors, immigrants and of course many UCLA students, some of these things are difficult and new to them.&#8221;  NWWNC president Michael Skiles said he supported approving the grant but asked Yebri if the FWL would be willing to have a relationship with the council after initially opposing the  creation  of the council in a series of posts on its website in 2018. Yebri said he was not aware of the posts but added he thought they should be taken down.   &#8220;The program is important, it has merit and we are here to build that relationship and create these lines of communication, do this work together,&#8221; Yebri said. &#8220;So I hope this is the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship for the entire Westwood community.&#8221;  Additionally, the council unanimously granted $2,446.79 to the Sprouts of Promise Foundation, a nonprofit connecting urban residents to locally grown produce. The grant will fund a community compost hub at the Westwood Village Farmers' Market.  The market is run by Farmer Mark, the sister organization to Sprouts of Promise. Aubrey Yarborough, a community development manager for Farmer Mark, said the new program will allow residents to drop off their compost at the market where farmers will load it on their empty trucks for use on their farms.  &#8220;I also think it&#8217;s pretty unique, granted I used to be a farmer and I&#8217;m a little nerdy on this, that people are going to be able to buy food from farmers and return the food scraps to the same farmers and know they are part of the same cycle of fertilizing their food,&#8221; Yarborough said. &#8220;That's intangible, but I think it's very meaningful.&#8221;  Yarborough said similar programs are popular in East Los Angeles, and she thinks it would be exciting to bring this program to the Westside where she has noticed demand for it. Such a program at Westwood could draw people to the Village, she added.  &#8220;I think it's exciting that you know when people from Venice and Playa Vista and Mar Vista call me asking about compost &#8211; I can say we have it in Westwood,&#8221; Yarborough said.  The NWWNC also considered a grant application from the Westwood Village Improvement Association, a local business district, at the Wednesday meeting.  The WVIA requested nearly $5,000 for homelessness outreach but received only $1,618.75 to fund a single outreach event. The WVIA&#8217;s Access Day, an event planned for later this year, will connect people experiencing homelessness with social services and offer them hygiene products. The association held its  first  Access Day in 2019.  Andrew Thomas, WVIA executive director, said the full $4,998.75 requested would fund Access Day and continual outreach throughout the year, including providing backpacks, underwear, hygiene products and TAP cards.  Councilmember Amir Tarighat said the council should separate the request to fund Access Day because that request is more defined and measurable.  He added the council is looking to give more grants to diverse nonprofit organizations and cautioned against granting the full amount, keeping in mind its limited budget.  &#8220;Maybe it's appropriate to do one NPG for that, see how it goes,&#8221; Tarighat said. &#8220;We can give anyone multiple NPGs, there's no limit on the number. Having a really defined scope and following up on something like that is, I think, a really good idea.&#8221; ",['cap-martin-bilbao'],"['los-angeles', 'news', 'westwood']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.npggalore.file_.jpg

No. 24 UCLA swim and dive (7-3, 4-3 Pac-12) sent its divers to the NCAA Zone E Diving Championships in Federal Way, Washington, from Monday through Wednesday. Despite the cancellation of all NCAA winter and spring championships on Thursday because of coronavirus worries, the Bruins came away from the King County Aquatic Center with three finishes that would have earned qualifications.  Junior Ruby Neave became UCLA's only double-qualifier when she scored highly enough to get into both the 1-meter and 3-meter springboard NCAA finals.  Neave first competed in the 1-meter competition Monday, and finished with a second-place finish in the event with a total score of 613.85 across the preliminary round and finals. Neave's first dive of the preliminary round scored a 48.30, starting her off in 11th place. But with her next dive, Neave moved up to second place and did not drop below third place for the rest of the event en route to her podium finish.   This marks the fourth consecutive season in which a Bruin has come away with a top-two finish in an event at the Zone E championships.   Freshman Hannah Butler also finished with an NCAA championships-qualifying score in the 1 meter, as she advanced to the finals with a fifth-place finish in the prelims, and placed sixth. Butler's qualification marked the first time since 2016 that a UCLA freshman diver qualified for the NCAA championships.  Neave collected her second qualifying score on day two, as she took sixth place in the 3-meter competition with a score of 623.30.  Butler finished just shy of joining Neave as a qualifier in the 3-meter, as she placed 14th with a score of 561.05 &#8211; just over than nine points behind the 12th place finisher, the cutoff to advance to NCAAs.  The only event in which UCLA did not finish with a NCAA berth was on platform. Freshman Katie Shaheen was the Bruins' only representative in the event and narrowly missed out on making NCAAs, as she finished in 12th place, about 16 points behind the ninth-place final qualifier.   Despite not qualifying, Shaheen set a new season-best in the preliminary round with a 236.05, then exceeded that record with a 243.50 later that day in the finals.

UCLA announced May 7 it would give each eligible student at least $200 in relief funding from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. However, undocumented and international students were nationally excluded from directly receiving any of the approximately $36 million UCLA received from the federal relief act.  Colleges and universities have the freedom to help their (undocumented) students, they just cannot use U.S. federal taxpayer dollars in order to do so, said Angela Morabito, a United States Department of Education spokesperson, in an emailed statement.  UCLA also announced May 7 it would use non-CARES Act funding to provide $200 universal impact awards to affected undocumented and international students.  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program provides some undocumented individuals, including students, with protection and eligibility for work permits in the U.S.  However, students with DACA status are currently awaiting a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court that could potentially suspend the program, which will determine their eligibility to live and work in the country.  The majority of DACA recipients face losing their current and future jobs if they lose their DACA status, Student A, an unnamed undocumented student who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said. She added that many DACA recipients are essential workers but do not receive health benefits.  The uncertainty surrounding DACA status and financial hardships have left undocumented students facing additional emotional challenges.  I feel like most people have a plan (A) and a plan B right now, but I've definitely had to make a plan C through Z, Nicole said. It's just been a lot of coming up with options for worst-case scenarios.  Nicole, whose last name is omitted because of safety concerns regarding her status as an undocumented student, said she never expected that the COVID-19 pandemic would change her life so abruptly.  When Nicole left campus in March, she assumed she would return in early April when students were then told in-person classes would resume.  By the time I actually came back to move and move all my stuff back home, all my roommates were gone, she said. Then I just ... moved back into my apartment. It was kind of a stark transition.  Transitioning to remote learning amid a global pandemic isnt easy, said Juan Maya Hernandez, an undocumented student.  I found that it's hard to concentrate, said Hernandez, a third-year atmospheric and oceanic sciences/mathematics student. I sleep in the living room. I don't have a bedroom or anywhere to study (at home).  An award of $200 in relief funding is not enough for many undocumented families, Hernandez said.  My dad is the only one in our family that is working, but he's a day laborer which is not very stable, Hernandez said. He makes like $19,000 a year, so you can only imagine him trying to take care of (the) seven or eight people (in our family).  The state of California and the Undergraduate Students Association Council are providing relief funds to undocumented students.  [Note to Justin: embed graphic here]  On April 15, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the Disaster Relief Assistance for Immigrants program, which will give undocumented California residents each a one-time $500 stimulus payment.  Student A said she was unable to receive the state funding because it is unclear how to apply for it. The universitys universal impact award is also not enough, added Student A.  The university has only given us $200 to satisfy that, so I think that is kind of sad, Student A said.  USAC has also created additional grants available to all undergraduate students, including undocumented students. The USAC COVID-19 Relief Fund, Student Wellness Commission COVID-19 Student Relief Grant and SWC Basic Needs Subsidy Program provide up to $250, $500 and $100, respectively, to UCLA students facing financial hardships.  Student organizations, including the University of California Student Association, are advocating for University aid for undocumented students, said Aidan Arasasingham, who sits on the UCSA board of directors.  We want to make sure UC campuses are providing (financial) aid to fill in (the) gaps for communities left out of CARES, said Arasasingham, the 2020-2021 USAC external vice president.  The UCLA Undocumented Student Program provides emergency scholarships and their regular services remotely, said Hernandez, who volunteers with the program. He added that the program hosts office hours through Zoom and utilizes social media to interact with students as much as possible.  While the university has taken steps to help undocumented students, more still needs to be done, Arasasingham said.  More (work) does have to be done to make sure emergency financial aid is equitable for all students, Arasasingham said. We want to make sure that the additional need-based aid that students who are not undocumented are getting can also go to (undocumented and international students).  Student organizations like Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success at UCLA have provided resources, support and a line of communication to the administration, Student A said.  I think we (undocumented students) wouldn't be here if there (werent) clubs like IDEAS advocating for us, she said. I think it's a lot that comes from student advocacy and people asking for the resources.  Before leaving campus, undocumented student leaders met with faculty to demand protection for undocumented students awaiting the DACA court decision, Student A said.  The university has been responding, slowly but surely, to our demands, and I think it's because a lot of students are demanding resources and for them to protect their undocumented students, she said.

UCLA men&#8217;s tennis (9-4, 2-0 Pac-12) earned a 6-1 victory over Liberty University (8-5) at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on Monday. The win marks the team&#8217;s fifth straight victory and improves the Bruins&#8217; home record to 5-0. The match was originally scheduled for Tuesday but was moved a day earlier because of forecasted rain.  &#8220;Honestly, we didn&#8217;t know until right before our practice on Sunday,&#8221; junior Bryce Pereira said. &#8220;But we were already getting ready because we knew it was going to be a tough week.&#8221;  UCLA began the day by securing the doubles point on court three, as Pereira and sophomore Patrick Zahraj picked up a 7-6 (2) win over Liberty's Chase Burton and Deji Thomas-Smith.  &#8220;Doubles can make or break the match sometimes,&#8221; Pereira said. &#8220;It puts a lot of pressure on the other team because trying to get four singles wins off a top team is really tough.&#8221;  After UCLA picked up singles wins on courts two and one, sophomore Roscoe Bellamy notched a 6-2, 6-3 win over Thomas-Smith to clinch the Bruins fifth home win of the season.  &#8220;Getting that first match under my belt was good, so overall I&#8217;m just happy with how it turned out,&#8221; Bellamy said. &#8220;Playing at home is always a huge boost because we always have a great group of people and a great crowd that comes out.&#8221;  Coach Billy Martin said he was happy to see Bellamy overcome recent injuries to earn the win &#8211; his first dual match win of his UCLA career.  &#8220;He&#8217;s really had a tough ride here. The last four years have been extremely difficult with injuries,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;He&#8217;s had bad luck but he&#8217;s been determined to get through it, and he&#8217;s playing well now.&#8221;  Matches continued to play out following Bellamy&#8217;s clinching win, and the Bruins secured victories in the two remaining matches. Martin said he was happy his team was able to stay active after not playing together in more than a week.  &#8220;We&#8217;ve hit a little bit but I wanted us to get used to the courts,"" Martin said. ""(Liberty) was a good team, and they&#8217;ve beaten some good opponents. I think it was really important for us to get this match in before USC and not go almost two weeks without a match.&#8221;  UCLA will resume its season Thursday when it hosts crosstown rival USC at the Los Angeles Tennis Center. With rain in the forecast for almost the entirety of the week, Martin said the team anticipates potential weather delays.  &#8220;I spoke with their coach today,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see how it goes but we&#8217;re both concerned about that.&#8221;  Match play is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. ",[],"['mens-tennis', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.mtennis.DS_.jpg

No. 25 UCLA mens golf tied for seventh in the Bandon Dunes Championship on Tuesday in Bandon, Oregon. Junior Devon Bling came in first overall, earning his second collegiate tournament victory.  Its pretty difficult to win, especially now (because) theres a lot of really good competition,"" Bling said. ""Im really proud of the way I found my composure,  In the first round, Bling shot a 1-under 70 to finish the day tied for 10th place. On the second day, he shot a 4-under 67, which moved him into a tie for first.  Despite a triple bogey on the final hole of the tournament, Bling's birdies on No. 5, 11 and 12 were enough for an even par-71, which clinched his position as the sole individual winner.  This golf course is so unique and different than anything that we normally play, and (Bling) just built a really nice game plan, which hes been developing over the last three years, said coach Derek Freeman. It's really starting to take form, and he's starting to understand how to hit the ball in the proper spots and just take what the golf course gives him.  The rest of the team had an opposite trajectory, finishing the first day of the tournament tied for second before falling down the ranks. UCLA shot an even par-284 on Sunday, just three strokes worse than first place No. 51 Oregon State. But a 10-over 294 from the Bruins on Monday took them down to seventh place.  UCLA then shot a 4-over 288  and two players shot even par-71s  in the third round of the tournament, but it wasn't enough to move the Bruins up the leaderboard.  Bling said his approach, and his advice to the other players on the team, was to play more cautiously when in difficult positions.  It was a completely different golf course that required a lot of creativity, and if there's a shot that doesn't feel very comfortable, then it's OK to play conservatively, Bling said.  Freshman Mason Greene had his first chance in the lineup this year and shot a 15-over 228 to tie for 80th. Freeman said it was a difficult for a freshman to come into a tournament in which every score would count.  Its a learning process, and as a freshman, being in the lineup can be overwhelming at times when you have tough conditions and a tough golf course, Freeman said. It can overtake your emotions, and I think he had that happen to him yesterday. When (Greene) shot 81, it basically took us out of the tournament. It's not his fault, you know, but it's, everyone's got to do their part and he's got to learn from it.""  Senior Hidetoshi Yoshihara played Sunday and shot a par-71 but was pulled from the course for the next two rounds because of a minor shoulder injury. Freshman Tony Hendricks took his place in the lineup, shooting a 13-over 226 to tie for 72nd.  Sophomore Bryan Wiyang Teoh shot a 2-over 215 to tie for 21st, while junior Eddy Lai shot a 5-over 218 to tie for 40th. Freeman said having one player, like Bling, shoot low scores in a tournament while other players struggle has been a pattern for the team.  The other guys just didn't play that well, Freeman said. It seems to be something that's happening to us. We'll have one guy playing well, well have two guys playing well  but we wont get everybody playing well together.",['cap-ellie-nowakowski'],"['mens-golf', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/golf.jpg

Valles added that CALPIRG is preparing to launch its virtual summer internship program this fall.     Nicolas Riani, a third-year public affairs student, said he will run CALPIRG&#8217;s New Voters Project in the fall. Riani said the project is the oldest and largest nonpartisan youth voter mobilization effort in the country. Riani added he supports the USAC resolution calling for the integration of voter registration into campus practices.    Appointments    Breeze Velazquez, the Academic Affairs commissioner, appointed Josephine Flores to the Campus Retention Committee for the 2020-2021 school year. Velazquez said she wants Flores to help the AAC make the CRC budget more transparent this year. Flores said she would report committee documents to USAC consistently and hold herself as well as other committee members accountable to CRC&#8217;s Statement of Understanding.     Internal Vice President Emily Hong Van Luong appointed Leslie Castelan to the vice chair of the Campus Safety Alliance.     Noe Garcia, the Financial Supports commissioner, appointed Angela Li to the CRC. Li said her position as the executive director of the Asian Pacific Coalition can supplement her work at the CRC. Li said she wants to increase transparency within the CRC through USAC appointments and personal conversations with individual USAC council members. Zuleika Bravo, who was a member of the CRC for the 2019-2020 school year, raised concerns about administrative pushback on budget transparency measures and CRC&#8217;s autonomy from USAC.     Naomi Riley, the USAC president, appointed Najma Ali to the Student Initiated Outreach Committee for the 2020-2021 school year. Ali said she feels a personal responsibility to give back to her own community to give them more opportunities to be college-ready. Ali said she will put public pressure on the administration to hold them accountable to SIOC members and its SOU.     Velazquez also appointed Raylene Factora to the SIOC. Factora said she wants to facilitate clear communications between the committee and the administration to press for budget transparency. Factora formerly worked as a News contributor for the Daily Bruin.      The council appointed Hector de Leon to the CRC for the 2020-2021 school year. De Leon said he will hold himself accountable so that the CRC remains student-run and student-initiated.    Old Business    Riani, a CALPIRG member, said the resolution of support for CALPIRG&#8217;s New Voters Project will institutionalize student voting on campus by embedding voting into existing campus programs, departments and resources.

Proposition 13 is a school bond that would give $15 billion to public schools from the pre-K-12 level all the way up to higher education to improve education facilities, said California Assemblymember representing the 70th District Patrick O&#8217;Donnell, who co-wrote the bill. The money the bond provides to the UC would be used for the construction and rehabilitation of its campuses, O&#8217;Donnell said.  If passed, the bond would allocate $2 billion each to the UC system, the California State University system and California community colleges. The remaining $9 billion would go to public pre-K-12 schools.  O&#8217;Donnell said he thinks Proposition 13 will economically benefit Californians in the future.  &#8220;An investment in school facilities is an investment in the students, and an investment in the students is an investment in California&#8217;s future,&#8221; O&#8217;Donnell said.  If passed, this bond will be the first time the UC would receive a general obligation bond to improve facilities since 2006,  according to the UC .  UC funding from the state has declined over the past couple of decades, said Alexander Astin, a professor emeritus in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies.  &#8220;A lot of UC campuses have had to curtail their construction of new facilities because of a lack of funds from the state,&#8221; Astin said. &#8220;So I think certainly it will be beneficial to UCLA to get some more money to help with the (necessary infrastructure) that we have.&#8221;  State funding for education has also decreased across the board, from K-12 to higher education, he added.  &#8220;(It) seems to me that California has historically been a leader in education across the country,&#8221; Astin said. &#8220;And in the last few decades, that leadership has declined because of the lack of funding.&#8221;  The UC&#8217;s inability to renovate, retrofit and build new buildings is a  major risk  to students, said Varsha Sarveshwar, president of the UC Student Association.  &#8220;The most obvious (issue) is that if there&#8217;s an earthquake or something like that, (the campuses are) not a safe place for students to be,&#8221; Sarveshwar said.  According to the UCLA Seismic Safety Building Reports, 15 UCLA buildings, including Powell Library, the Luskin School of Public Affairs and Charles E. Young Research Library, were found to pose serious risks to life if a strong earthquake were to occur.  Disability access is also an issue, she added. If the UC is unable to renovate buildings or fix broken elevators, then campuses may become increasingly inaccessible for students with certain disabilities, Sarveshwar said.  Sarveshwar also said the lack of funding has made it difficult to respond to the increasing number of students in the UC.  &#8220;We have a lot more students at the University than we used to in years past and we haven&#8217;t really been able to grow our facilities in order to meet that increased need,&#8221; she said.  The proposition&#8217;s funding is vital for making sure that students at the UC have spaces that are unbiased, in good condition and safe, said government relations committee chair of UCSA and third-year global studies student Aidan Arasasingham.  Voting for Proposition 13 is one of the few ways UC students can work to improve their campuses and advance their own education, Arasasingham said.  &#8220;This measure really isn&#8217;t a political issue but an issue of whether we, as the state, should be investing in the spaces that we as students use,&#8221; Arasasingham said. &#8220;This vote is one of the most crucial ways students can exercise their civic rights in order to better their own lives on the UC campus.&#8221;  Opponents to the proposition argue that the bond pays for the renovations with taxes instead of using the state&#8217;s surplus, creates higher local property taxes and pushes local school districts further into debt by raising the debt limit on schools, encouraging them to increase borrowing.  Under the proposition, the only proposed plan for UCLA is to seismically improve Powell Library. However, the UCs are required to create a five-year plan to make more affordable student housing and deal with necessary maintenance in order to receive the proposition&#8217;s funding.  &#8220;My guess is that this is not necessarily going to have a huge impact on UCLA beyond whatever they do for affordable housing,&#8221; said Ozan Jaquette, an assistant professor in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. &#8220;It just doesn&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s much else happening for UCLA besides making Powell building more earthquake-proof.&#8221;  Jaquette added that a big weakness for the UC and UCLA is that there is no capacity for online education teaching and for the growth of online curricula, as the classrooms are not able to deliver online or hybrid courses.  In order to allow education to reach more of the world, the UC and UCLA need new infrastructure, he said. However, he said he thinks the UC and UCLA appear to have not prioritized this infrastructure, which likely won&#8217;t be changed with the extra funding.  However, Jaquette added that he thinks the bond has merits.  &#8220;There are buildings that are falling apart that need renovations just for safety,&#8221; Jaquette said. &#8220;As well as I&#8217;m sure K-12 and the university level need new construction in order to increase capacity for more enrollment.&#8221; ",[],"['california', 'news', 'university-of-california']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.news_.prop13.file_.jpg
714,/2020/03/03/the-quad-the-double-edged-sword-of-donations-in-developing-diverse-student-bodies/,52.0,49.0,129,28.0,0.8571,0.5962,$0.00,The Quad: The double-edged sword of donations in developing diverse student bodies,https://dailybruin.com/2020/03/03/the-quad-the-double-edged-sword-of-donations-in-developing-diverse-student-bodies/,"Wed, 04 Mar 2020 04:22:26 +0000",Camayak_840def0f39," While free college tuition seems like a dream, it will soon be a dream come true for some students at USC come fall 2020.    High tuition, expensive books and countless other costs &#8211;   it's no secret that paying for college is difficult for many students. The  average yearly cost  of attending college in 2019 was a staggering $53,980 for private schools and $26,590 for in-state tuition at public schools. As a result, about  44.7 million Americans  have student debt.  The salience of this issue is demonstrated by the debate it causes among  presidential candidates , who disagree about how to best lower the price of college.  While many believe that higher education should be accessible to all, rising tuition and other costs associated with attending college still present a barrier. According to  The   Hechinger Report , up to 40% of low-income students accepted into college do not attend because of the high cost of tuition.  To solve this problem, some schools are offering reduced or free tuition to students with family incomes below a certain level. For example, USC recently  announced a plan  to expand its financial aid to undergraduate students by providing tuition-free education to families with an annual income of $80,000 or less.  Additionally, USC will no longer consider homeownership when determining the financial need of its students. This provision will increase the amount of money given to many students, especially those in California, where home values have generally  risen at a faster rate  than income.  Trenton Stone, Undergraduate Student Government president at USC, said in a  USC Press Room article  he believes the initiative will make   USC more accessible to those from different financial backgrounds. USC anticipates that these new policies will directly benefit over 4,000 students every year once they are completely implemented.  Isaiah Turner, a student at USC, thinks this policy will encourage more diversity on USC's campus.   ""I think it will definitely increase the diversity of people who apply to USC,"" Turner said. ""Typically, minorities are the ones who make less income than white people. With this change, a lot of people who may have not considered USC before because of the price tag will now apply.""    Other private schools across the United States have similar policies to lessen the financial burden on many of their students. For example, Columbia University offers tuition-free education to those with family incomes of $60,000 a year or less. Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Duke University, Harvard University and Princeton University also have  similar programs .   How do these schools fund such generosity? Private schools draw from their substantial endowments.  Endowments are the collection of donations that schools receive from alumni, businesses and others that may be invested by the university and used at its discretion. USC currently has  an endowment  of $5.7 billion, which is small in comparison to Harvard&#8217;s $40.9 billion.  While these   private donations can be used to promote greater equality, they have also been linked to scandal and injustice.  Last spring, a nationwide college admissions scandal exposed the disproportionate influence of personal donations on college decisions at various schools across the country, including Yale University, Stanford University, Georgetown University, University of Texas at Austin, USC and UCLA.   Evidence revealed following the college admissions scandal illustrated how, at USC, officials  considered how much money  families could donate to the school when deciding whether or not to admit their children. UCLA experienced similar controversy as it was revealed that one parent paid $400,000 to have her child accepted to the school as a soccer recruit.   These examples demonstrate how personal donations can both help and hinder a university&#8217;s attempts to create more equitable policies and a diverse student body.  While UCLA does not offer free tuition based on annual income at this time, financial aid, grants and other scholarships have enabled UCLA to maintain a relatively  high proportion of low-income students  &#8211; 30% compared to USC&#8217;s 21% and Harvard&#8217;s 16%.  Additionally, the University of California's  Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan  covers systemwide tuition and fees for students that qualify for financial aid and have a total family income of less than $80,000 a year.  Katie Wynne, a second-year statistics student, thinks that such initiatives are necessary considering the importance of a college education in attaining higher-paying jobs.  ""A college degree is more expensive than ever &#8211; however, also more important than ever to acquire,"" Wynne said. ""It is apparent that more affluent families have a clear advantage over less affluent families in affording such higher-level education.""  The recent events at USC and many other universities illustrate both the potential benefits and the danger of private donations, which can create both more accessibility as well as more disparity in universities' student bodies.   As more students go to college , students, educators and politicians alike will continue to debate over how to best confront problems such as student debt and diversity in their attempts to make higher education accessible to more students.

And for students living in apartments, it also means learning how to navigate a world of unreliable landlords.  The dynamic between Westwoods landlords and student renters  has long been strained.  Poor communication, unfair leasing practices and a general lack of consideration for tenants leaves students feeling disrespected by those in charge of their new homes.  But because theyre often first-time renters, students dont have enough know-how or are simply too scared   to push back. Their hesitation to act leaves them at the liberty of their landlords, which causes uncomfortable living situations for many Bruins. This power imbalance is intimidating, but it won't change as long as students lack an understanding of their tenant rights. Inexperience and limited affordable options leave students at the whim of landlords, and getting educated seems to be the only option to effectively alleviate the exploitation.  In the status quo, the misconduct is obvious.  Tomi Fennell, a fourth-year international development studies student, said one day he was locked out after his landlord did a showing of his apartment.  Fennell said he walked to his landlord's office, where he was not able to get access to another key without leaving a credit card as collateral.  Additionally,   he said his landlord ignores almost any concerns he and other tenants have.  He will be literally midconversation with somebody on the phone thats expressing a concern about something serious in our apartment, and hell just hang up,"" Fennell said. ""Then if you try to call him again, hell hang up while its ringing.""  According to state law, if landlords do not respond promptly to complaints, tenants are within their rights to  get help  from the Housing and Community Investment Department. But for students just moving off the Hill, resources like these are not common knowledge.  Landlords benefit off the scarcity of affordable housing in Westwood by capitalizing on students' fear of not finding a place to live  and the maltreatment continues throughout their entire landlord-tenant relationship.  Westwood rent isnt cheap, and a lot of trust goes into renter-landlord agreements. Students dont deserve to have their rights neglected  not to mention blatant disrespect from their landlords.  Several landlords were contacted for comment and all declined to comment on record.  Maggie Miller, a fourth-year psychobiology student, said water began pouring from her ceiling one night and caused the fire alarm to go off. Miller said her landlord blamed her for the situation by suggesting she threw water at the fire alarm after hearing it go off.  It seems as though they felt we were incompetent, Miller said. There was never trust in us, it was always skeptical and always coming from a place of Oh you probably did it, but I think most often, people dont throw water at a fire alarm.  Westwood is a beautiful area and students who earned a spot at UCLA deserve to enjoy living in it.   Instead, Bruins are backed into a corner when   landlords take advantage of their lack of knowledge and options.  And for many, that undue stress often begins before move-in.  While competition already exists naturally for Westwoods limited apartment space, unfair leasing processes create unnecessary anxiety. For instance, a standard lease in the state of California is around 10 pages or less, but many students said their leases were between 20 to 30 pages and contained oddly specific requirements.  Miller said the lease at her previous residence forbade doormats, and another Westwood building mandates that the apartment stay above 72 degrees at all times.  It's evident that students are not treated as ideal tenants.  But to be fair, perhaps its because they are not.  Student renters represent a group with a high turnover rate and a reputation for being messy and inexperienced. At the end of the day, a landlord is running a business for which students are not the most desired customers.  Further, while students spread their grievances to friends and respective landlords fairly quickly, they often do not enact legal challenges or formal complaints  and as such, landlords have no motivation to change their ways.  And motivation isn't just low among landlords.  Miller said her security deposit was withheld after she moved out because of damages that predated her move in, but she decided not to challenge building management.  ""We just wanted to get out of there, Miller said. It wasnt worth fighting anymore.  Fennell said residents in his apartment building have floated ideas of lawsuits against their landlord, but because their stay is so temporary and their resources so limited, it never feels worth it.  Of course, many factors like time and financial resources   play a role in   students' struggle to fight back, which allows the unfair practices of many Westwood landlords to run amok. Although understandable, their same timidness perpetuates the cycle of poor living standards for students as a whole.  Bruins have  resources to understand their rights , and if they want to see long term change in the Westwood renters market, they owe it to themselves to start getting educated.  The college learning process is more than midterms and dorm rooms; it's also learning to stand up to people on a power trip.",['cap-isabel-weinerth'],"['opinion', 'opinion-columns']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.op_.weinerth.landlors.SG_.jpg

Running at the Freud Playhouse through March 14, director Emily Chase said &#8220;The Rover&#8221; was originally written by 17th-century playwright Aphra Behn, one of the first female playwrights who was able to support herself with her work.   Chase said Behn was a writer during the Restoration era, when the British monarchy was reestablishing itself after decades of King Charles II&#8217;s exile. Though it features outdated perspectives on race and religion, she said the play's portrayal of female characters was far ahead of its time.  ""(Behn) wrote about women who were, without apology, ... sex workers doing what they need to get ahead in life and take care of themselves,"" Chase said. ""There's a kind of empowerment for women that is very unusual for the place and time.""    [Related:    Theater production challenges traditions via magical realism, diverse characters   ]   But this is still a 17th-century play, so the leads and most of the characters are male. The play follows two knights who are tasked with protecting the exiled king as they travel to Naples, Italy, for the annual pre-Lent bacchanal known as Carnival. Graduate student David Kepner plays Willmore, the titular &#8220;Rover,&#8221; who just wants to indulge his depravity during the festival, but ends up caught in a love triangle. He meets and falls for both Hellena, a young woman destined to become a nun, and Angelica, a courtesan whose affection would cost Willmore an amount of money he does not have.  Kepner said he drew inspiration from comedies he&#8217;s enjoyed in the past, particularly Johnny Depp&#8217;s portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. Depp&#8217;s wavy, perpetually intoxicated mannerisms inspired Kepner to portray Willmore in a similar fashion. However, he said Willmore's attitude is more of a shield because he is perilously afraid of being in love. For the protagonist, love is a weakness and detrimental to his traditional notions of masculinity, Kepner said.  &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t want people to see his vulnerable side, and that&#8217;s what Hellena brings out in him,&#8221; Kepner said. &#8220;Willmore is trying to pass as this manly pinnacle of a man, ... but underneath he&#8217;s trying to hide his vulnerabilities.""  Willmore&#8217;s closest companion, Belvile, is quite the opposite character. He is played by graduate student Rogelio Douglas III, who said Belvile is a romantic whose only goal is to find the woman he loves and propose to her. Douglas, however, took an entirely different approach in seeking out influences for his character by making playlists.  Douglas said he compiled a mix of tango, salsa, soul and '90s R&amp;B to get into the mind of a character who has romance on his mind but keeps getting distracted by the temptations that surround the Carnival celebration. Every day before rehearsal, Douglas said his song of choice was ""All My Life"" by K-Ci &amp; JoJo, which helped him get in the right romantic mood. The song particularly reflects Belvile's confident and gentle nature while complementing his charm and grace.  Graduate student Kathryn Schott portrays the similarly charming and romantic  Angelica, who comes off not like the typical coy and chaste woman of the time period, but one who is sexually liberated and financially self-reliant.  However, Schott said this outward demeanor is all a part of her business. Angelica is a courtesan, a paid-for social and sexual companion who recently returned to Naples looking to take on new clients.   [Related:    Rob Clare will highlight women&#8217;s woes in his version of &#8216;Troilus and Cressida&#8217;   ]     Schott said Angelica represents a character who at the time was unheard of &#8211; an independent, self-sufficient woman who was comfortable with her sexuality. However, Angelica's weakness is in matters of the heart. When Angelica and Willmore first get together, Schott said she quickly develops an emotional attachment that throws her off her game. This affection is a new experience for the character who has spent years dealing with platonic sexual partners and never falling in love.    &#8220;All of a sudden Angelica goes from not ever having experienced love ... to falling in love and not knowing what to do with that,&#8221; Schott said. &#8220;Willmore has made all these promises of being in love, and (Angelica) is less canny than (she) might ordinarily be if it was just a financial relationship.&#8221;  Set in a more reserved society than that of modern times, the characters utilize the Carnival celebration as an excuse to indulge in risky behaviors and take chances when they would otherwise restrain themselves. For Chase as the director, Carnival is almost a character unto its own. The looser social norms allow the characters to be more honest about their desires, she said. The setting also led Kepner to lean in to the easy nature of Willmore's personality, exacerbating a character who takes fun to an extreme and bounds around the stage with his fellow cavaliers.  ""This play demands such high energy all the time that if you do not deliver on that, it becomes a bore,"" Kepner said. ""This is the first play where I feel like it's almost an athletic event.""

SC:  My name is Sam Connon. I'm the Sports editor at the Daily Bruin. Today I'm joined again by co-host Ryan Smith, Daily Bruin senior staffer, former sports editor. Ryan, how you doing today?   Ryan Smith:  I'm doing good but not as good as LiAngelo Ball, who got himself a contract offer today.   SC:  Yes he did, former UCLA men's basketball dropout LiAngelo Ball, that is correct. So, yeah, I mean, speaking of UCLA men's basketball. We'll be talking a lot about them today. But we'll also be touching on UCLA football's representatives at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis this weekend and we'll be visited by Matthew Joye. He's a former Daily Bruin assistant Sports editor and now he is a digital media programming assistant at NFL.com, so he'll be joining us in a bit to talk about that. But starting off, UCLA men's basketball, now alone in first place, top of the Pac-12 standings, clinched a bye in the conference tournament, we've been talking about this team for weeks, just seems to keep trending up. Ryan, I know that the Arizona game was great too, but we'll just start off in chronological order, go with that Arizona game first, but wow, what a finish.   RS:  What a finish  two great finishes this weekend  but obviously the first one against Arizona State, Jaquez got the handoff, the good screen from Campbell. They got their revenge, and they needed it to have that good positioning in the Pac-12 standings. And Arizona State, they came out, they played a good game, but UCLA, like they've been doing the last few weeks, they're coming through when they need to. And that was a big win for them.   SC:  Yeah, and I know UCLA is 6-0 against Pac 12 teams in the second end of the season series this year. So I mean, we'll see how that goes against USC on Saturday, but generally, the second time that Mick Cronin gets a look at your team, it's not great news for you, it's better news for the Bruins. So Ryan, do you just want to walk me through that last play? I know Cronin didn't call a timeout, but what were your thoughts on that play, how you saw it develop?   RS:  Um, you know, it was kind of slow, but I've always been a big fan of the dribble handoff and then just set the screen. I think it's a great way to get some space when there's really nothing developing with a play. Tyger did a great job of positioning himself in a way that got Jaquez some space. It was a little bit of a deep 3, but Jaquez is a good shooter and he had just no space between him and Campbell's man and he was able to knock it down over the top. And then he also got the steal at the end to clinch it. But that dribble handoff play's always a great backup option when the plays not really developing in the half court.   SC:  Yeah, and it's crazy because Tyger Campbell  I mean, I noticed this at first but I didn't really notice it until I watched the replay a few times, but he really set that screen hard. It wasn't just a handoff and kind of roll, like, just kind of bump into a guy. Like, he said his feet, set that screen hard. He's 5-11, most of that has to do with his hair, he's not a big guy. And I mean, props to him for setting that screen and running the play to perfection really.   RS:  Just speaks more to his basketball IQ that we've been seeing all season. You know, he's not that that eye-popping athlete but he just so smart out on the court, whether it be his passing, getting to the basket and, in this case, just setting up a really, really solid screen.   SC:  Yeah. And Jaime Jaquez, just the amount of clutch that you have to have to take that. I mean, he's a 32% 3-point shooter on the season, and they ran a play for him with no time left on the clock to shoot a deep 3. I mean, it's just crazy how that panned out.   RS:  And he's a freshman.   SC:  It's a freshman. He really was not playing like it. He doesn't physically look like a freshman, mentally it really doesn't seem like he's a freshman. I know, Kris Wilkes is probably the superior offensive player if you try to compare the two of them, but just thinking Kris Wilkes, his freshman year, was just such a very pure scorer but kind of passive, would defer to the older players like Aaron Holiday, Thomas Welsh, but Jaime doesn't really have that. He has Chris Smith, but Smith's not really a pure scorer. So it's good to see Jaquez kind of take over that role as a freshman, which is, it's just crazy to see.   RS:  Yeah, and the other thing I love about Jaquez as well is if you watch him away from the play, I mean, he's battling underneath a lot of times with big men on switches. He's in there getting rebounds half the time, half the time I see him he's going up in the trees and trying to make a play, he's batting the ball out to his teammates. I mean, he's an all energy guy, he can shoot the ball, he's a good defender, we've seen him on the break plenty of times this season. I mean, he's just out there getting it done, and he's a perfect type of player for what Mick Cronin has been trying to do here.   SC:  Yeah, and this part I don't really want to gloss over because the first half of that game, it really seemed like it was going to be the Jake Kyman game. He had three possessions in a row where he hit 3s and the crowd just absolutely erupted, he was celebrating, chest bump with Chris Smith, going nuts, the bench was going crazy, that was really fun to see. And I know Cronin kept running this play and Arizona State could not do anything about it, where they'd start with Kyman in the corner, and then have Jaquez and either Hill or Riley  whoever was in  down on the two blocks, and then they'd just do a double screen and he'd run by both of them come around to the other wing and shoot a wide-open 3.   RS:  I mean, if it isn't broke, don't fix it. You know, I mean, if if Kyman's gonna get that kind of space, you like your odds of the ball going in the way he's been shooting, especially lately. The Bruins need the shooters to step up and Kyman's been that guy for them. David Singleton's also been pretty hot from outside recently, but Kyman's the guy right now to take those shots. And if you got to play that gets him open, I mean, by all means run it.   SC:  Yeah, I mean, they're shooting almost 34% from 3 during conference play, which is about middle of the pack in the conference. But a lot of the reason that they aren't lower is because of Kyman, he's shooting 40% on the season. I mean, we all know David Singleton's a really skilled shooter, but he's shooting 36.7, and Kyman is really the one who's kind of bearing most of the load on the 3-point shooting, and I think Cronin's taking advantage of that and calling plays for it really well. And then kind of moving on to Saturday's game against Arizona, another must-win game for UCLA to get an at-large bid or fight for seeding and everything. I know Arizona, I'm sure, was looking for revenge after the Bruins beat them a few weeks ago. But once again, UCLA came out on top. Last minute, Tyger Campbell banks it in on a floater after missing his first 10 shots of the game. I don't really know, once again, how a freshman or redshirt freshman had that confidence, but he did, it was crazy. Ryan, what did what were your big takeaways from that moment and that game as a whole?   RS:  I mean, in terms of just down the stretch, I mean, I think the biggest thing we learned  if we didn't already know it  is no one on this team is afraid. They don't care who takes the big shot and they have confidence in everybody. It was Chris Smith, twice, to cut it to two and then tie it. He had the little baby hook in the lane and then the really nice turnaround J to tie it. And then obviously Tyger put it away with the floater. But I mean, it was Jaquez on Thursday, then it's Chris Smith and Tiger Campbell. I mean, anyone can hit the big shot for this team, and that's very important, especially when you're getting into these games where they're close at the end. If you're able to give it to anybody, it's great in terms of confusing a defense, you never know where the big shot's going to come from. And obviously, I guess the grand takeaway this weekend is this team can win any game. I mean, they're never out, especially the way they've been playing defense lately. That Arizona game especially, they were matching the Bruins' offense, you know, shot-for-shot and it was kind of starting to feel like Arizona was just going to keep responding and they would be able to hold the Bruins off, but the defense stepped up at the end the Bruins hit the big shots and came away with the win.   SC:  I know UCLA finished the game with six or seven straight defensive stops. So, I mean, that's Mick Cronin's identity, that's huge. But then also going back to what you said about Chris Smith, kind of going in the in the final minutes there. That turnaround jumper, I remember Kris Wilkes would take that his freshman, sophomore year and everyone would roll their eyes, say, ""Come on, why are you taking that? I know you're a good shooter, good scorer, but what are you doing?"" Who would have thought two years ago, when Chris Smith and Kris Wilkes came in at the same time, that Chris Smith would be here and you would have confidence in him taking a turnaround mid-range jumper in the final minutes of a tightly contested conference game. It's crazy, the narratives that have changed with him. He didn't even, I mean, he had 17 points, but shooting 33% from the field and missed a few free throws. He didn't have his best game but you can still trust him down when you're, when it matters most, which is what's craziest to me. I mean, so the defense was crazy, Chris Smith down towards the end of the game. Tyger Campbell, eight assists again, I mean, he had a double-double on Thursday night. He just  everything is clicking for this team, like you were saying.   RS:  And I mean, it was also crazy because Tyger and Chris Smith, I tweeted it out during the game, they were 3-for-20 at one point combined near the end of the game, and they're just the guys still taking the big shots at the end, and they're hitting them. I mean, there's just never-ending confidence with this team right now. And no matter who has the ball, you just feel like it's going to work. It's just going to work out.   SC:  Yeah, I mean, it's going to be really interesting to see what they do at the Galen Center on Saturday against USC. But I don't know, we'll take a little bit of a look ahead of that at the Pac-12 tournament next week. I'll be there in Las Vegas covering that. Really looking forward to that because, I mean, the more I get to watch this team person, the better. They're just really entertaining to watch, play a good brand of basketball, honestly. I know everyone was scared when Cronin was coming in saying, ""I don't know, is defensive basketball really going to draw eyes, drive viewership?"" But I mean, from my point of view, winning basketball is good basketball, so I'll be entertained.   RS:  And it is definitely a weird dynamic, I mean, the way that this team has started to gain attention from the national media. They almost feel like  I don't want to say like a Cinderella-type, because it's UCLA basketball, like, why would this team be considered, you know, a Cinderella, it's supposed to be good  but it's just they seem like the darling team right now. And everyone wants to watch them and people are excited that this team is back and having success.   SC:  Yeah, I mean, they're right now in Bracketology, Joe Lunardi's Bracketology, they're actually in the bracket. I mean, they're in there because they're projected to win the Pac-12 tournament and get the automatic bid because they're in first place right now. But I mean, if Oregon wins both of its games this weekend, then it'll move to the second seed. But either way, I think if UCLA beats USC and then wins one game in the Pac-12 tournament, that could be enough for an at-large bid because that will be what, nine wins in a row? And then lose to a pretty good team in the Pac-12 semis? I think if they, if UCLA beats USC, wins its Pac-12 quarterfinal matchup, wins its semifinal matchup, I think that's it  there'll be a lock to be an at-large bid, they don't even have to win the Pac-12 tournament at that point. If they make it to the Pac-12 championship game, that's that. I mean, this would be one of the best end-of-season runs by a UCLA team ever, by any Power Five team ever, really. It's just kind of crazy how it's all panned out.   RS:  Yeah, I mean, this isn't like it's some gradual, you know, improvement. I mean, this was a team that was struggling in game 15 of the season. And all of a sudden out of nowhere, the switch flips and they can't make a mistake. And the way they're playing, if I'm someone that's looking at who to put in the tournament, there's no way in my mind UCLA is not a team that absolutely deserves to be there. There's no way it's not one of the top, you know, 30 teams in the country, at worst. I mean, it's a team that that definitely deserves to be there, and they've shown that over the past few weeks.   SC:  Yeah, I mean, the loss to Fullerton, that's brutal. The loss to Hofstra, that's tough, but I mean, Hofstra is a tournament team, we shouldn't take them is a total crap team like Fullerton is. But I mean, when you're the hottest team in the country  and UCLA probably is  you can kind of overlook those bad losses when you're trying to decide who makes that tournament. So, yeah, that's about all we have on UCLA men's basketball. Game on Saturday, coming up at 12:15, Ryan and I, we'll be in the Galen Center covering that, so looking forward to that. And then Pac-12 tournament coming up after that. Alright, and now we are joined by Matt Joye, used to be part of the Daily Bruin, now you're working for NFL.com. How you doing today Matt?   Matt Joye:  I'm good, it's good to be back on the show. It's been about three or four-year hiatus so you know back when Aubrey Yeo and I were on the airwaves, and now you guys are holding the ship down.   SC:  Yeah, bringing back the the legacy of ""Out of Bounds."" It's definitely fun to bring it back, have you on the show. But uh, I know we definitely want to talk to you about the NFL Combine, you were doing a lot of coverage for it this weekend. Four UCLA guys were there. I don't know, what were your big takeaways from the four of them, who kind of stood out the most?   MJ:  The one that I heard the most about when I was like watching the NFL Network coverage  which that's like my job, I have to watch the NFL Network around the clock  and the guy who really stood out a lot was Darnay Holmes, in terms of not necessarily his testing, but his on field drills, which, I think, us as fans and reporters, like, we rely on, you know, the Deion Sanders of the world, the people who have played and the scouts to like, inform us on, ""OK, this drill doesn't have a time attached to it, it doesn't have like a weight or whatever, or a distance."" So you have to like rely on the analysts a little bit to talk about the footwork and the technique and everyone was kind of, not in awe of Darnay's technique, but they were saying like, he was one of the most technically sound corners there. And like, you know, for them to make a select segment on an NFL Network show for a guy who, going into this competition wasn't really one of the main guys, he wasn't a Jeff Okudah, he wasn't C.J. Henderson from Florida, you know, he was probably a middle of the pack corner guy who, you know, didn't really warrant that kind of attention. So I think like Darnay is the one that you know, even though he didn't run the way I thought he would he got a lot of, you know, analysis over him, you know. Whereas, you know, Asiasi didn't really, Joshua Kelley had a little bit, but there was like a lot of attention on Darnay.   SC:  Yeah, and the 40-yard dash is always interesting, because you never know how that applies directly to an NFL game because how often are you running 40 yards unimpeded, no one else in your way? So even though Darnay's 40 time was kind of in the middle of the pack for corners. You just look at that play against Arizona last year, where he had that chase-down forced fumble to prevent the touchdown. So, I mean, you look at the 40 time, maybe it's not the best, but when you're looking at in-game straight speed, like what the 40 time's supposed to mean, you know he can catch up with the guys.   MJ:  Yeah, and I mean, we've seen that so many times over the years of the 40 time not being indicative of in-game speed. In this combine alone, you had certain guys, that were not expected to run as well as they did, run really well. You know, Jefferson from LSU, the receiver, ran around 4.43, people were expecting maybe he go 4.5. Chase Claypool, a 6-4 receiver out of Notre Dame, ran a 4.42. And then on the other hand, you have people in the NFL who are really fast, like, you know, Antonio Brown  back when he had his head on straight  he ran a 4.56. And then in the in the game, he's like burning people on punt returns and going deep. So, you know, I think you've got a great point that like, in-game speed is more about kind of combining lateral footwork and speed because you're never really running in a direct straight line. And that's something that's kind of hard to quantify.   SC:  Yeah, I know, you were saying Deion Sanders was talking about Darnay pretty highly, I know he was at his camp a few years ago. So Darnay definitely has a lot of pedigree behind him. I don't know, Ryan, just from this season, what did you see out of Darnay that makes you think he could or couldn't be a good NFL prospect.   RS:  I mean, Darnay this year, obviously battled some injuries and stuff that it was obvious that there were some games he wasn't on the level that we were used to seeing him. But I mean, he's still the same DarnTay, he's got that speed, he's got good technique and like you were saying, I mean, we've seen his talent in-game before, we saw that play against Arizona, and so we know what he's all about. I don't think this year was very indicative of what he can be just because I don't think he was really ever 100%.   SC:  Yeah.   MJ:  And Darnay, if you look back, there were there a couple plays in the Oklahoma-UCLA game that was in Norman where Nate Meadors was getting burned in that game quite a bit by CeeDee Lamb who's, you know, some people consider him the best wide receiver prospect in this class. But, you know, Darnay stood up and had some good, you know, snaps in that game that probably are to his benefit, the fact that the guys who's going against and the quarterback he was going against, Kyler Murray at the time. You know, like he has good game film that he can, you know, rest his laurels on.   RS:  I mean, Darnay is just one of those guys where if you're watching a game casually, he stands out. Yeah, I mean, he might have had a rough season in terms of some dumb penalties and stuff like that, but he's definitely one of those guys who you're watching and he just he looks faster, it looks like he knows what he's doing.   MJ:  Yeah, yeah, he passes the eye test.   RS:  He does, yeah.   SC:  It's gonna be interesting though, because at UCLA, Darnay was the No. 1 corner, he was kind of like, the shutdown guy. But when he goes to the NFL, he doesn't really have the size or physicality to line up with guys outside the numbers. So I mean, he has some some good speed and Matt, like you were saying he has the, like, the technicality, so I think he can develop to be a pretty decent like nickel slot kind of guy. Like that's how guys are kind of talking about him at this point. He's not the shutdown guy like everyone thought he would be. But he's still a pretty good prospect in a certain role.   MJ:  But yeah, and nickel guys are becoming more and more important in today's NFL like Justin Coleman, the former Seahawk got picked up with a huge contract by the Lions in free agency last offseason, and he's like exclusively a nickel guy. And it's because you're going against a lot of not only 11-personnel groupings with three wide receivers, one tight end, one running back, but you have also even when it technically might be one running back, two tight ends, the tight end is like a Travis Kelce or a Gerald Everett and they're in the slot. So it's like you need somebody, and sometimes they'll put a linebacker out there, hybrid guy, but you really do need some kind of nickel guy in this day and age in the NFL.   RS:  You think Darnay can make a good special teams gunner?   MJ:  Yeah, that too. Yeah, I think so. As long as he doesn't target, you know, because he's he was notorious for that UCLA.   SC:  The Jim Mora era, full of targeting.   MJ:  Yeah, exactly.   SC:  Yeah so I mean, we'll move over to the offensive side of the ball. You got Joshua Kelley, Devin Asiasi, both put up pretty impressive numbers, probably better than we were expecting just in terms of the pure tests. But I don't know, Matt, what did you see out of the two of them? Who kind of had the more buzz this weekend?   MJ:  Well, I think the the best positive of the weekend from a UCLA perspective on the offensive guys was Joshua Kelley's three-cone time, running the 6.95, best of all running backs who participated in it. And so that was a definite plus. I'd say the minus was Devin Asiasi's, I think he had 16 bench press reps, which was I think tied for second worst amongst tight ends? And you know when you're 6-3, 257, you're expecting more from a tight end in that department. And you know, unlike Caleb Wilson last year, Asiasi, even though he played in the slot a lot and he can catch, he became a really prolific pass-catcher in UCLA's offense this past year. You want to see, you see him and you're like, he actually has the potential to be an in-line tight end, kind of if he wanted to be. You know, whereas Caleb Wilson, like no matter how much he bulked up, there's kind of like a cap there for him to be kind of an in-line guy. You see a guy like Asiasi, his body type, his build and you're like, I want to see those bench press reps get up to like 23, 25. I want to see him, you know, be a more well-rounded 257 pounds and be like that more physical, multifaceted tight end as opposed to a one-trick pony. Which, right now, he's kind of a one-trick pony in the pass-catching realm, which doesn't make sense considering his physical traits, he should be able to do both.   SC:  Yeah, and I know a lot of the scouts were talking about in the NFL, their player breakdown of him, say it was, saying that one of the issues was that weight fluctuation midseason for UCLA and just over the offseason, no one really knew what he would measure in that. Yeah, it was definitely a lot in the air. Like, you got pretty broad numbers that he could be and when he comes in at 257, that's when you're like, ""OK, so he'll be that blocking guy,"" but once again, he hasn't really showed the strength and like the consistency to do that between these tests and like with UCLA last season. So it's going to be interesting with him because, comparing him to Caleb Wilson, Caleb Wilson was that one-trick pony as a receiver without the potential, but just physically speaking, Asiasi, you would think has that potential. So that's why he could be a mid-to-late round pick, maybe picked higher than Mr. Irrelevant Caleb Wilson was last year.   MJ:  Yeah, yeah, no I agree on Asiasi. Ryan, what do you think of Asiasi?   RS:  I mean, same type of stuff. I mean, last year, we know Kelly was trying to get him into more sets where he was blocking, but that's really just not his style as of right now. And he was more of a red-zone target in the pass game. So, you know, it really just comes down to that that physical stuff with Asiasi.   SC:  Yeah, and those those red-zone targets are important. And I mean, going over to Joshua Kelley, a lot of his touchdowns this season were like the short yardage, goal line stuff scenarios, unlike last year where he broke out big plays. So I know he had a 4.49 40-yard dash, which is, I mean, I think 4.5 was about where he was expected to go, so I mean, it was it was definitely impressive, but the 23 bench press reps were also really impressive.   MJ:  Seven more than Asiasi.   SC:  Yeah, which is crazy.   MJ:  He weighed in, I think Joshua Kelley weighed in at like, what, 212? Yeah, 212. So at 5-11, 212 versus 6-3, 257 and nevertheless, he has seven more benchpress reps. So I don't know if that's an indictment on Asiasi or, you know, a compliment to Josh Kelley. You know, we never question Kelley's work ethic and his positivity, he exudes that. So you almost wonder if Kelley's mentality toward the game went into Asiasi's body, what it would, if that would be like UCLA's perfect combine prospect for this year.   SC:  Yeah, I mean, you saw Kelley in those press conferences over the past week. He just continues to be Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky, it's great.   MJ:  Exhibiting confidence, and not just confidence but like positivity, yeah?   SC:  Yeah, I mean, he's still finishing up this quarter at UCLA, he's gonna get his degree. And I know I've seen his agent on Twitter is obviously talking him up a lot, that's her job, but at the same time, like, I I feel like that's getting a lot of buzz, just his personality traits. I don't have any inside information on who he did interviews with, if he had any, but I would feel pretty comfortable saying that he knocked any interview out of the park. It's really just fit and system at this point for him. I mean, it's not like he's going to be a top-three, maybe even fourth-round pick. He'll definitely fall in the back end of the draft, but I mean, I feel like he kind of set himself up pretty well last week.   MJ:  Yeah, I think he might need to show a little bit more in the pass-catching realm in pro day.   SC:  Yeah, yep.   MJ:  He did really well in the pass-catching reps at combine that I saw him take, but you know, that's a limited sample size when you're trying to go through like 30 running back prospects. You're not going to get as many, you know, routes to run, passes to catch, so on and so forth.   SC:  Yeah, it was interesting because last offseason for UCLA football, I know Chip Kelly was talking a lot about  and Joshua Kelly too  about how they wanted to get Kelley more involved in the passing game, and everyone was kind of looking forward to that. And I mean, it kind of took a hit when he was out at the beginning of the year and Demetric Felton moved to running back, so there's your pass-catching back. But at the same time, it was definitely kind of interesting to see all the confidence they were saying about Joshua Kelley in the offseason and then to come back and he only has 11 receptions for 71 yards as a receiver, which is just like not really what you're looking for in an NFL running back today.   MJ:  What Daniel Jeremiah said during the combine coverage was that, you know, Chip Kelly had told him that the reason Kelley wasn't  Joshua Kelley  wasn't as involved in the passing game was because he was that, you know, first three down or first two down back where he was primarily a runner. And then on those downs when there were primarily passing situations, Kelley, personnel-wise, would be out of the game, and they'd bring Felton and they'd bring Martell Irby and whatever it may be. And that's kind of why the snaps were they were intending to throw to running backs, Kelley wasn't in. It wasn't like he was running routes and not getting open or dropping the passes. It was just a personnel, you know, issue I guess.   SC:  Yeah, definitely.   RS:  I mean, it was also hard to believe, like, a lot of the things that were being said about especially the running back group at the beginning of the season. I mean, whatever was said really wasn't translating onto the field. I mean, there were games where Josh Kelley is sitting there on the sideline without his helmet on and Felton's getting all the snaps and you don't know why. And turns out there's nothing wrong with Josh Kelley, he's just not getting the snaps. So I mean, if the plan was supposed to be him catching balls, I mean, everything was kind of out of sorts, especially at the beginning of the year.   MJ:  Yeah, even in the year that Kelley broke out in 2018, you saw his playing time was sporadic until he really hit his stride in like about the fifth game. That Fresno State game, he didn't get one carry, he didn't get one snap, much less one carry, he didn't get one snap. So it's like, it was strange that, you know, you see this ball carrier more than anybody else out here. You know, granted it's not always in-game actions, it's practice action, but like, it was weird how, you know, Kelley had to like, it seemed like play himself into that role with his in-game numbers. And then you would think he's the perfect practice back, but, you know, up until that point he didn't really get many reps. Like the Cincinnati game, 2018's regular-season opener, they got him going a little bit, then Bolu, but it was just like all over the place, where usually his running back rotation just didn't seem to have any consistency to it until Kelley broke out. And then when the 2019 season started, it went back to that again a little bit.   SC:  Yeah, it's definitely going to be interesting to see how these guys translate to the NFL, because whether or not Chip Kelly's able to turn this program around this season or if he even gets another season, I feel like everyone's pretty comfortable in saying he didn't really, like, utilize these players to their maximum talent. Like, Darnay was a five-star guy and then, I mean, it just kind of goes up in the air.   MJ:  Asiasi too, I think he was like four- or five-star, Asiasi.   SC:  Yeah, so I mean, you get these guys who are talented, have their ups and downs with production. So I mean, the combine is definitely an interesting way to see how they are isolated, no coaching involved, really. But it'll be interesting to see down the line, in the draft, rookie minicamps in the spring, so yeah, that'll definitely be interesting. And then one last question on the NFL Combine stuff. Matt and Ryan, quick thumbs up, thumbs down, yes or no. JJ Molson as an NFL kicker?   MJ:  No.   RS:  No.   SC:  No.   After that Arizona game, you can only    MJ:  I feel like there was a networking thing that got him into the combine, like some kind of agreement with Molson brewery or something. Like when I saw him    SC:  Were they an NFL sponsor?   MJ:  No, they weren't. But like I just, like, when I saw it, that was the first thing I thought of, was like, there had to have been some kind of networking thing going on here that got him on the list.   SC:  Was this like kicker affirmative action? Did they have to hit like a quota of how many kickers they had to invite?   MJ:  If they had kicker affirmative action, there are many other kickers they could have chosen than JJ Molson, with all due respect.   SC:  A guy who hits all his extra points and does basically nothing else.   MJ:  And he's really never shown much outside of like, what 45 yards?   SC:  I mean, it really hits nothing outside of 45.   MJ:  Yeah. So you know, and that was consistent in the practices that I saw him too, every time that they pushed Molson out, and, you know, it just was very inconsistent. I know, for every kicker it is, but like for Molson, he would struggle to make like, pretty much 20-30% of them. So yeah, you know, I didn't see his film when he was there, they don't show the kicker film. Hopefully he did well and, you know, made his case. But yeah, it was a little bit strange seeing him as one of UCLA's four invites to this event.   RS:  And this Molson season was like one of the more like, low-key fascinating things about this season because his year in 2018, he had a really good season kicking the ball and despite not really having that range, the distance.   MJ:  Yeah, he was consistent inside 40, 45.   RS:  Yeah, and you know through the spring, the spring practices a year ago, it was sounding like Molson was maybe adding that aspect to his kicking game. There was a lot of hope that he was going to become one of the nation's better kickers but it really just never translated into the games for whatever reason and, you know, here we are.   SC:  Yeah, so that's about all we have on the NFL Combine. I mean, UCLA football, definitely a big topic going on right now, spring practices just started, so we'll be covering those on Daily Bruin Sports. A lot coming up for UCLA men's basketball. I don't know, Matt, you want to give quick thoughts on UCLA men's basketball?   MJ:  I mean, they're just like defending like crazy. Even when Howland came in and took over for Lavin, it took a full season of like, raw failure, like just utter failure. They did have a nice win in Washington that year. But there was a whole season of you know, ""Let's scrap this and then start from scratch,"" and then the second year they made it to the NCAA tournament. The speed of this turnaround has been something to behold. It's just like, how people are, you know, buying into Cronin so quickly, it almost makes me think that they were just so ready to buy into anything else but Alford and what was going on before, that like they soaked it up like a sponge once they said, ""Oh, this stuff, these new tactics actually work, what Cronin's teaching us works."" So yeah, I'm really excited to see what happens at USC over the weekend. And, you know, it's just really cool to see a defensive team, like, seemingly overnight. And I think the window's there for them now too because college basketball just seems more open than ever. The best teams talentwise are teams with like no experience and they're more susceptible to upsets. And like, you'll get Arizona on paper, Arizona, you know, has the talent. But you know, Mannion is not, he's still a freshman. And so UCLA, the fact that  it just shows their coaching. Like, Cronin's excellence as a coach is manifesting itself, I think, and more quickly now.   SC:  Yeah, I mean, 'SC game on Saturday will be a big one. I mean, we got that this weekend. Women's basketball Pac-12 tournament this weekend, baseball and softball still going, gymnastics, there's a lot going on. But I know that a lot of people are just talking about men's basketball and for good reason. But yeah, that should be just about it for this week's episode of ""Out of Bounds."" Matt, thanks so much for coming in.   MJ:  It's good to be back, thanks for having me.   SC:  Yeah, I mean, I know you guys did the show a little bit differently in your day, but I mean, it's fun to keep it going.   MJ:  No, it wasn't, you know, we didn't reinvent the wheel or anything. It was pretty much like this.   SC:  Yeah. Ryan, thanks for hosting again.   RS:  Of course.   SC:  Yeah, so I mean, we'll have one more show in the quarter, next week, before finals for us, spring break. Thanks to Ryan and Matt for joining me today. Thanks again to Omar Said for helping produce this episode, yet again. And yeah, thanks for listening and see you next week.

The junior, subbing in for senior Madi Yeomans, swept her court five match 25-23, 23-21 alongside junior Megan Muret for No. 2 UCLA beach volleyball (9-2) en route to a 3-2 win over No. 5 USC (4-3) in the Pac-12 South tournament.  Earlier in the day, May and Muret were the only pair to fall to Arizona State (4-4, 1-1 Pac-12) in the Bruins' 4-1 win, getting swept 19-21, 16-21. Coach Stein Metzger said since the duo was a last-second pairing decided just 40 minutes before the match, the juniors had only one chance to practice in the week leading up to the tournament.  &#8220;I thought they handled it very well,&#8221; Metzger said. &#8220;You&#8217;re never at your best when you&#8217;re thrown together, especially in this kind of sport and this environment. So the fact that they came through with the deciding win was huge.&#8221;  Muret started regularly as a freshman but was removed from the lineup during the majority of last season. In her first matchup with the Trojans since February 2019, she clinched the dual with all eyes on her court.  She said it felt good to beat USC in UCLA's first match against the Trojans on the new Mapes Beach courts.  &#8220;It feels so good to be back on the court,&#8221; Muret said. &#8220;All my teammates were out there cheering us on, and I know I was on the other side of it last year cheering them on, but either side you&#8217;re on, it feels great to be part of this team.&#8221;  The Bruins swept on courts one, two and three against the Sun Devils on Saturday morning, but court four was forced into a tiebreak. Freshmen Devon Newberry and Rileigh Powers dropped their first set to Arizona State 25-27 before picking up the second and third sets 21-17 and 15-7, respectively.  Later in the day, UCLA swept only on courts one and five, falling to USC on courts two and three.   Newberry and Powers again led court four to the only tiebreak of the dual, which again ultimately resulted in a point for the Bruins. Their win tied the dual at 1-1 heading into the second flight of courts. Had the duo lost, based on the ordering of the courts, the Trojans would have won the dual before the court five match finished.  This was the freshmen&#8217;s first time playing UCLA&#8217;s crosstown rival in their collegiate careers, which Powers said she has been anticipating for years.   &#8220;When I was in high school, I would always watch (UCLA) play USC and I was like, &#8216;I cannot wait to play here and (against) USC,&#8217;"" Powers said. ""That really inspired us to go out there and do our best and fight for every point.""  With more than half of the Trojan lineup different from the last time the Bruins faced them in Gulf Shores, Alabama, for the NCAA championship, Metzger said there were many new faces on the court since last season.  Both USC and UCLA had new court one pairings, with senior Savvy Simo and sophomore Abby Van Winkle winning the match for the Bruins &#8211; something last year's court one duo of Nicole McNamara and Megan McNamara was unable to do in four of its six matchups with the Trojans.  &#8220;Both teams graduated quite a lot of people,&#8221; Metzger said. &#8220;So you had a lot of new bodies out there that had to deal with a really emotionally charged match, and I thought we did a nice job. Even though we didn&#8217;t play our best game &#8211; we still got a lot to improve upon &#8211; I thought (the Bruins) stayed pretty centered and calm and patient until the end when we scraped together a couple points to win.""  UCLA will close out the Pac-12 South tournament Sunday against Oregon (3-3, 1-1) and Washington (2-3, 0-2).

This is   ""The Future.""  At first glance, science and art often seem like separate forces, but graduate student Dasul Kim blends the two together in her upcoming solo exhibition ""The Future&#8221; to make a statement about a more hopeful fate. Kim's past exhibitions in South Korea were focused on current events and the pain experienced from them, but her upcoming solo exhibition will be her first in the States, with a thematic shift toward hope instead of pain.  The works will be on display at the Broad Art Center on Tuesday and allude to real-world crises to bring awareness to global warming and inspire activism, she said.  &#8220;We must invest time and energy as long as we&#8217;ve caused this problem to solve it,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;I am doing this kind of art, and hopefully it can impact the world, or at least the audience. I think my aim as an artist is to let my audience think about what I&#8217;m concerned about.""   [Related:    Design media arts exhibit highlights artists&#8217; interpretations of migration   ]   When she noticed significant environmental issues, such as climate change, weren't being addressed by the public or government ,  Kim said she used her scientific research to share her own commentary within her exhibition. In addition to implementing research  , she said she also incorporated elements rooted in shamanism, such as the rhythmic beats of shaman rituals. This influence emphasizes how scientific predictions regarding climate issues &#8211; such as melting glaciers and species extinction &#8211; are often fulfilled because people believe the projected statistics will come true regardless of what they do, Kim said.    [caption caption=""Kim said &#8220;The Future&#8221; includes a portion inspired by once-popular online chain-mail messages. She said she creates metaphors surrounding global issues.  (Ashley Kenney/Daily Bruin)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_376435"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   In her research, Kim said predictions regarding excessive use of plastic and increasing atmospheric heat levels continued to be proven true because of the population's belief that this was inevitable. As a result, Kim said she wanted her work   to provoke thought about these issues so individuals could hope for a better future instead of resigning themselves to these scientific prophecies.     Other graduate students had the opportunity to view ""The Future"" and give Kim feedback before its official opening. Graduate student Dalena Tran   said the art was layered with references to real-world events, like the Australian wildfires, and Kim's custom-made pieces made the work visually stimulating. Tran said a pedestal piece in ""The Future"" rhythmically bounces rice to imitate the shaman rituals that use rice for telling fortunes. This allusion serves as a reminder of the ability that comes with a spiritual belief like shamanism to hope for an ideal, mystical future, Tran said.  &#8220;Kim was situating the context of today&#8217;s issues, which involve climate change as well as protests and demonstrations around the world and natural resources,&#8221; Tran said. &#8220;(Kim) was using different levels of  interpretation, so she had several sculptures.&#8221;   [Related:    Art to Heart: Intersection of art and math generates visually complex representations of nature   ]   Scientific statistics aren't outwardly listed in Kim's exhibition but are instead incorporated through the ideas behind the statistics. With this research-based art approach, some of her findings inspired some of the other pieces in her exhibition, Kim said.   In one of her pieces, a telephone message references the once-popular online chain-mail messages to incorporate different issues seen on a global basis. She disguises the issues &#8211; such as the wildfires in Australia and the negative effects of single-use plastic &#8211; through chain-mail punishment to create an eerie metaphor. Science and art, in this case, actually go hand in hand, Kim said.   Graduate student Berit Gilma also attended Kim's exhibition critique and said each exhibition item is like a clue for audiences to piece together Kim's environmentally motivated message.  ""You get all these hints, and it feels like you have to solve a riddle, which I really enjoy because it's not completely abstract,&#8221; Gilma said. ""We can take things from philosophy or science or psychology or whatever and use these means of art to communicate something from a different perspective.&#8221;  By using science to support her art, Kim said she hopes audiences looking at her exhibition become motivated to have more concern for the environment. Kim said her exhibition would make audiences do just that by instilling a sense of fear and curiosity about these topics to inspire them to make changes in their lives.  &#8220;I hope people think about (climate change and social issues), and people who are concerned can make this a larger part of society,&#8221; Kim said.

Q : Is time a concept that the human mind can comprehend? How does the perception of time change?   A : It is a concept that we use regularly and have become used to, rather than having an understanding of what it is.  People have only a level of familiarity with time, as opposed to a level of understanding, said Brent Corbin, an academic administrator in the physics and astronomy department who also teaches undergraduate physics courses.  Time is something that is used routinely &#8211; people know how to measure seconds on a stopwatch, Corbin said. However, time cannot be seen, unlike space, meaning people are only familiar with how to use time rather than understand what it really is.   Mayank Mehta, a professor in the departments of neurology, neurobiology, and physics and astronomy, said people typically use light or the absence of it to sense if it is day or night.  People&#8217;s perception of time extends beyond the clock &#8211; it is also influenced by experiences and desires, Mehta said.   The space-time relationship   Albert Einstein developed his theory of special relativity based on the concept that space and time were relative. This means observers at different speeds experience space and time differently. For example, for a person on Earth, the clock on a spaceship traveling at a higher speed is slow. However, for a person on the spaceship, the clocks on Earth are fast.  Corbin said space can be easily defined, but time is more difficult to imagine.  Corbin said he would describe time as the temporal interval between events &#8211; what he calls a fancy way of saying time is time.  One way the human brain understands time is through events, Mehta said.  According to Mehta, an event positions an individual at a specific place in a specific moment in time, and time is the interval between the preceding and following events of the moment.  An event happens at one time and at one place; however, Corbin said two different observers might measure the time of the event and the distance to that event differently as they have different accelerations.  &#8220;The brain cares for causality because this is how we perceive the world,&#8221; Mehta said.  Causality is the principle that every event has a cause.  It is possible to apply what we know about space to try and describe time, Corbin said. Like the three axes of three-dimensional space &#8211; x, y and z &#8211; people can say time is another dimension that only moves forward, he said.  &#8220;We extrapolate this idea of talking about coordinates in space to talking about coordinates in time, and therefore time must be a dimension as well,&#8221; Corbin said.   There is some debate of whether time is a dimension or a parameter, Corbin said. The difference between the two is subtle, he added. A dimension is independent of other dimensions, whereas a parameter relates to other dimensions, meaning a change in time forces a change in position, he said.  If one were sitting still, to that person time is moving forward but their positions are not changing. Therefore they might consider time as a dimension. However, to a different observer in space, this same person is changing their position as the Earth is moving with time, even if it appeared as though the person hadn&#8217;t moved at all. To this observer, time is like a parameter.  &#8220;In this model, the idea that time is a parameter (says) we're kind of wrong in thinking that there's a temporal axis that we walk along,&#8221; Corbin said. &#8220;Time is just a way that you get from one point to another to another in space.&#8221;  Dean Buonomano, a neurobiology and psychology professor, said some people argue that humans developed the ability to engage and conceptualize time by using our understanding of space. One argument for this is our use of language, he said.  &#8220;We often use spatial metaphors to talk about time. So in the sense that we might say it was a long day, or it was a short class or 'I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow,'&#8221; Buonomano said. &#8220;These things, long, short, forward, backwards, are all spatial.&#8221;  People&#8217;s accuracy of time passed between events depends on the time duration itself, Mehta said. For example, if the sound and light in a video were off by a second, people could immediately detect that something was wrong; However, if asked about inconsequential events like when someone had breakfast or lunch, people become more inaccurate depending on whether it was a couple of hours back or a day before.   One's perception of time also differs based on one&#8217;s enjoyment of an activity; the more enjoyable an activity, the more time seems to pass quickly, Mehta said.  &#8220;Our perception of time is based on our experiences or desires, not just the clock,&#8221; Mehta said.  According to an article published by BBC, time under lockdown seems to pass slowly while one is bored and is experiencing the lockdown, but as restrictions start easing, the time spent under lockdown seems to have passed by quickly.  Buonomano describes this phenomenon using prospective time and retroactive time. Prospective timing is when one engages with something in the future &#8211; like counting five minutes from now, Buonomano said. Retroactive timing is dependent on how many memories one can create of that event, he added.  One example of this is the holiday paradox, he said.  &#8220;If you go on a vacation and a lot of very interesting things happen, ... then by the time the day is over, it might have seemed like (time) flew by ... because you weren't paying attention to the time,&#8221; Buonomano said. &#8220;The day after, maybe when you look back on that, you might say, &#8216;That was a very long day. I learned a lot. It was very productive,&#8217; so you have the feeling that it lasted a long time.&#8221;   The brain and time   The brain is a computational device, Buonomano said. Our eyes, hands and ears are inputs for information, which is stored as memories, and we generate outputs in the form of our behavior, Buonomano said.  The brain is an inherently time-sensitive organ because it is a means of survival and human interactions are temporal in nature, Buonomano said.   All humans have a circadian clock inside them; this can result in physiological responses like the growling of the stomach when it is time to eat, or tuning our temperature when the sun rises, Buonomano said.  People use their experiences to make long-term and short-term predictions, Buonomano said. For instance, people learn how to anticipate a red light or interpret what another person says by using their memories of similar moments, he said.  The brain allows us to think about the past, present and future, Buonomano said. It allows us to time travel mentally. This is a unique ability that humans possess &#8211; the ability to relive past experiences and learn from that experience, he added.  &#8220;This idea of mental time travel is powerful as an evolutionary adaptation that allows us to not only predict the future but to create the future,&#8221; Buonomano said.

Film productions ground to a halt last quarter as stay-at-home orders went into effect, whether they were taking place locally or globally. While many film students in UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television choose to shoot their projects near UCLA, graduate student Reem Jubran said she journeyed to Palestine, preparing to shoot a passion project which explores taboo topics such as transgenderism and marrying outside of ones culture. But she said her production soon began to unravel when she had to replace several key members of the production because of flight cancellations and instances of xenophobia.  Obstacles were being thrown at us, but I still feel like I was super determined,"" Jubran said. ""We were problem-solving like theres no tomorrow. And these arent normal production problems that you usually face.   [Related:   Musical artists change tune to cope with canceled shows, limited production   ]    Jubrans first major problem arose when her cinematographer, graduate student Mengyuan He, would have potentially been denied entry into the country as a result of her Chinese nationality. This was resolved by arranging for a letter from UCLA proving that she had been residing in Los Angeles for several months.  She said that although most of the Palestinian locals were welcoming and supportive of the production, the crew still experienced several instances of xenophobia. Jubran said she was shocked when her assistant director informed Jubran that her parents would not allow her to work on set because He was Chinese. Soon after, Jubran said she experienced another   xenophobic encounter during a team lunch.  There was a table of men that had just started their meal, and they got up and left the restaurant at the sight of He, Jubran said. Fear was just dominating everyone. Fear was just eating everyones soul.  In addition to such xenophobic obstacles, Jubran said she also had to recast her lead actress after her first choice was denied entry as a result of a new Israeli travel law. Shortly after, the Palestinian authorities announced they were closing all roads and enforcing shelter-in-place regulations, at which point she decided it would be nearly impossible to proceed with filming.  Graduate student Yao Liu, who was also preparing to shoot her film, said the university's shift to remote learning brought her   production to a halt in LA. As an international student from China, Liu has faced uncertainty about when she will next be able to see her family in person as a result of COVID-19-related travel bans.  This is kind of my norm in my life, because I can only talk to my family back at home via different screens, Liu said. But the reality is that I cant go back, or maybe if I go back, I cant come back. ... It is very difficult to process.   [Related:   Alumnus rolls out film aiming to stir pot with fresh take on marijuana culture ]    While she was unable to shoot her intended project, Liu said she is currently working on a documentary at home about intimate emotional and mental health conversations between mothers and daughters, which she said are particularly difficult topics for her to navigate because of her Asian background. And rather than filming on a physical set, Liu said she has been electronically contacting old friends to use as documentary subjects.  Even before graduate student Jinsui Songs film for the MFA directing program was shut down, she experienced difficulties when her cinematographer was ordered to self-isolate upon returning from a trip to China for two weeks prior to filming. But after the two weeks were up, the switch to remote learning also made it impossible to shoot her film. At the moment, Song said she is unsure what returning to set might look like, since many proposed safety measures could have a big impact on the creative potential of future scripts.  If theres a production, everyone on set should be six feet away from each other, and the actors cannot be close to each other, Song said. We cant have any intimacy scenes in the script  theres no kissing, no hugging.  Such safety measures are also a point of struggle for graduate student Gabriella Wiltz, who planned on using her background in dance filmmaking to explore the close relationship between two dancers in her project. Wiltz said she may be unable to portray the intimacy she was planning to show between the two friends if they have to be across the room from each other at all times.  With her original project on hold indefinitely, Wiltz is currently working on a documentary about her life in quarantine, exploring challenges such as cooking for herself every day while living alone. Like her graduate student peers, Wiltz said she misses the communal aspect of shooting a traditional film and has been using this time to reflect on the kind of leader she would like to be when she finally returns to set. Wiltz said she wants to be a light in an industry that still suffers from gender inequality and outdated forms of thinking.  I miss making movies in a fun and safe environment with people that I care about, Wiltz said. I think maybe this pandemic is an opportunity for us to kickstart a lot of different changes that need to happen.",['cap-isabel-molina'],"['arts-entertainment', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/grad-film-shoots.jpeg

It's time to take the test.    These measures, of course, can help you do well on your exam. However, they are not the only factors that will impact your success.     Throughout the quarter, GPA can be affected by more than just hours logged on Quizlet: Levels of anxiety, self-perception and confidence can make all the difference between an A or a B, or perhaps between a pass or a fail. With final exams looming, it is important to consider how we can effectively manage our performance.   A 2018 study from the National College Health Association states that 63% of college students reported feeling overwhelming anxiety in the preceding year. Anxiety can affect quality of life, including decreased performance and lower self-esteem.   However, despite the clear negatives that come with it, some anxiety is a natural part of test-taking.   In 1908, scientists Robert Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson proposed a relationship between arousal, stress and performance. This relationship is called the  Yerkes-Dodson Law.    Alan Castel, a UCLA psychology professor who focuses on cognitive psychology, says there's an optimal amount of anxiety.   &#8220;As you increase arousal, performance increases to a certain point, and then it starts to decline,&#8221; Castel said. &#8220;So you want to kind of hit that sweet spot.&#8221;   Essentially, you need at least some anxiety as motivation, Castel said. Castel structures his class with this understanding, giving graded quizzes every week but no final exam.   As someone that has struggled with anxiety my whole life, this law explains much of my successes and failures. When I tell people about my anxiety, many people say something along the lines of, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry so much&#8221; or, &#8220;You should care less.&#8221; However, this advice does not actually make any of the things you have to do go away, and at the end of the day, I still need to excel in my classes to get into medical school.   Instead, I channel my anxiety as a motivation to do well.  Good Therapy      released a list of ways to turn your anxiety into something positive, including accepting the inevitability of anxiety and confronting the fear your anxiety stems from.   Sometimes, I spend more time panicking than actually starting   my work. If you're feeling stressed, take time to calm yourself down, go for a run, or practice self-care.  To-do lists can help, too. According to  a 2011 study   , those who write down what they need to do tend to perform better.   Simply creating a plan for how you will achieve all the overwhelming activities you need to do can help lower anxiety.   Another important player in academic success is confidence.  Research shows  that a great predictor of academic success is academic self-confidence.   Confidence, as it turns out, has a lot to do with how we see ourselves and the way we think that others see us. Performance can also be influenced by a phenomenon called the  stereotype threat , which occurs when we are in a situation in which we might affirm a negative stereotype about ourselves.   Another related phenomenon that can also get in the way of academic success is  imposter syndrome . This phenomenon is characterized by a constant inability to accept that your successes are deserved based on your skills and abilities. For example, a Bruin might not believe that they truly belong at UCLA, thinking their acceptance was a fluke.   In combating imposter syndrome, it is important to take pride in your successes and remember that it is a phenomenon everyone experiences &#8211;  even Albert Einstein . Remember how doing well made you feel and carry that confidence over to your next set of exams.  There are also methods to transform your overall confidence levels and de-stress before an exam.   First and foremost, of course, is to find an effective study routine and crack open your textbooks. But also remember to balance this out with breaks for relaxation, exercise and self-care.   Now let&#8217;s say you manage to do all of this but still feel a sense of doubt creeping in as you enter the lecture hall.   Before you take your seat, consider another small method that can help tip the scales back in order: the power pose. According to a  Harvard study   , people who stood in an open, powerful way before walking on stage to give a speech tended to be more successful in performance or presentation, as well as be more likely to be hired.   Maybe, however, the panic sets in once you&#8217;ve sat down and opened your test. Is there anything you can do at this point to lessen anxiety and boost confidence?  According to a  set of tips from Deakin University , there is. It suggests quelling fears during an exam by taking deep, regular breaths while closing your eyes, promoting blood flow by flexing then relaxing your fingers, or writing down all the information you know about one topic in order to find links or trigger memory. There&#8217;s also my personal favorite: If you do not know the answer to a hard question, skip it and come back.   Another solution to the academic performance conundrum may simply be time.   Lavi Paoletti, a fourth-year economics student, said that he keeps a level head during exams because he knows that panicking will just make it worse. His confidence carried from always doing well in high school into freshman year of college, but there was a sudden shock when freshman year wasn&#8217;t as easy as his previous schooling had been, he said.   &#8220;I definitely work harder to prepare myself for the test now,"" Paoletti said. ""When I first got to UCLA I just thought it would be easy because everything was easy in high school. Now actually, I'm better at gauging how much work I need to put into classes.""  Jack Gobel, a second-year business economics student, had a similar high school to freshman year transition.   He said that he could easily blow through work in high school and it worked for him. But once coming to college, it did not work the same way &#8211;  especially his first quarter.   Castel said freshmen tend to have the least accurate expectations of performance, and fourth-years tend to match-up their confidence with ability better. He explained that experience matters in order to manage your expectations.     As we approach the end of our quarter, try to keep in mind what's helpful anxiety and what's overwhelming. Go for a run, take a deep breath and ace that exam.  ",[],"['academics', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/Test_Anxiety.jpg

One day after claiming a 4-3 victory over California (3-4, 1-1 Pac-12), No. 3 UCLA      women's tennis (12-1, 2-0) defeated No. 9 Stanford (10-2, 1-1) by a score of 4-1 Saturday, its first win at the Taube Tennis Center since 2014.  Saturday's win marked the Bruins' second defeat of the Cardinal this season, as UCLA swept Stanford in the semifinals of the ITA indoors Feb. 9. UCLA had also beaten California at home Feb. 21 by a score of 7-0.  &#8220;We knew it was going to be a tough match,&#8221; said coach Stella Sampras Webster. &#8220;We also knew Stanford was trying to get some revenge on us from the (ITA) indoors, but I think our doubles came off really strong. We really got off to a great start there.&#8221;  Not long after juniors Abi Altick and Annette Goulak earned a 6-0 doubles win on court three, sophomore Elysia Bolton and redshirt senior Jada Hart clinched the doubles point for the Bruins with a 6-1 victory on court one.  The Bruins have now won 12 out of 13 doubles points this season.  &#8220;It helps so much (to get the doubles point), especially against a tough team like Stanford,&#8221; Altick said. &#8220;Just coming out and dominating the doubles really gets us going into singles.&#8221;  Altick also provided the first singles point for UCLA against Stanford with a 6-3, 6-1 straight sets victory over the Cardinal&#8217;s No. 97 Janice Shin, marking her fifth straight singles win and her first over a ranked opponent this season. Altick also earned the Bruins&#8217; first singles point Friday with a 6-0, 6-2 straight sets win over the Bears&#8217; Anna Bright.  &#8220;Altick&#8217;s been playing some of the best tennis she&#8217;s played since she&#8217;s been at UCLA,&#8221; Sampras Webster said. &#8220;That&#8217;s really been a big help at both singles and doubles. She&#8217;s just such a fighter and a great player.&#8221;  On court five against Stanford, Goulak found herself trailing the Cardinal's Sara Choy 5-1 during the first set tiebreaker. However, the junior transfer climbed back to claim a 7-6 (8), 6-4 straight sets victory while Bolton and freshman Sasha Vagramov &#8211; who had clinched her team-high sixth match against the Bears the day before &#8211; were each still locked in their third sets.  Goulak&#8217;s win clinched the victory for UCLA over Stanford for the first time in her career as a Bruin.  &#8220;It felt unreal,&#8221; Goulak said. &#8220;Indescribable feeling. ... We have a lot of hard workers, and when someone&#8217;s not playing well, someone else is there to pick up the slack. We have really great team camaraderie, and we&#8217;re always there for one another. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve all been super successful.&#8221;  Sampras Webster said the key behind the Bruins' success away from home this weekend was the team's ability to avoid off-court distractions. Namely, the match at Stanford was delayed four hours because of rain.  &#8220;Every match this weekend was really tough, contested and competitive,&#8221; Sampras Webster said. &#8220;I was really proud of how they stayed within themselves, didn&#8217;t get distracted by the crowd or the moment or the delay, and stayed disciplined. A lot of times, it's just about keeping them calm and sticking with their gameplans and just not getting distracted.&#8221;  With the two victories this weekend, UCLA extended its winning streak to five while securing a 2-0 start in Pac-12 play. The win also snapped Stanford&#8217;s 38-match regular season winning streak.  &#8220;We&#8217;re super happy,&#8221; Altick said. &#8220;We had a lot of motivation to win today, and I think this shows that we&#8217;re one of the best teams in the nation.&#8221;  The Bruins will get two weeks of rest before hosting Washington State and Washington at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on March 21 and 22, respectively.

UCLA will enter the rivalry match on the heels of a 6-1 win against Liberty on Monday. The Bruins built a 4-0 lead to clinch their victory before playing out the remaining three matches. Junior Bryce Pereira said the team&#8217;s ability to play out all matches was a good mental test for everyone.  &#8220;Matches can just change within a few minutes,&#8221; Pereira said. &#8220;You can be up on all the courts and then all of the sudden, all of the courts around you lose and it could come down to your court.&#8221;  USC won the ITA national team indoor championship in February, a tournament that saw UCLA notch a 1-2 record. Martin said his squad is prepared to take on one of the best teams in the nation.  &#8220;We got to see USC play quite a few matches back there and we&#8217;re so familiar with a lot of their guys,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;Most of those guys we know pretty darn well.""  Last year, the Bruins defeated the Trojans 4-3 in Westwood in a match that was clinched by a singles win from then-freshman Patrick Zahraj.  Sophomore Roscoe Bellamy said the team is ready to have another fun match with its crosstown foe.  &#8220;Playing 'SC is playing 'SC and, no matter what, it&#8217;s going to be tough and it&#8217;s going to be fun,&#8221; Bellamy said. &#8220;And shoutout to Patrick Zahraj for that clinch last year.

Martin said there can be lots of emotion when facing their rivals but that his team needs to properly channel the energy.  &#8220;For me, this match comes down to a lot of emotion and who can control that emotion,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think we were the favored team last year and we had a little magical ending here so I&#8217;m hoping we can pull off some of that same magic here this year.&#8221;  The match is scheduled to begin at noon.

But with ""Adobe Punk""   revolving around the early 1980s punk rock scene that they both   know so well, alumni Chavez and Garza said it only felt right for them to co-create, write and direct the play. Set in the town of Bell Gardens, the fictional theater work-in-progress follows three young punk rock fanatic Angelenos as they undergo their artistic comings-of-age.  Produced by About Productions   and slated to premiere spring 2021 at the Company of Angels theater,   the duo holds work-in-progress readings and workshops across Los Angeles in locations related to the play, such as Bell Gardens and San Pedro.   Having learned that his ancestors' home burned down in the 1980s, Garza said he wanted to explore the link between that event and the early punk scene with his mother.   &#8220;It reminded me of my affinity towards punk music, which is something that I&#8217;ve always loved,&#8221; Garza said. &#8220;I correlated this actual event of this house burning down in the early '80s with what was happening with the punk scene at the time, which was sort of at its height and its end in a way.&#8221;    [Related:    UCLA punk conference to focus on experiences of marginalized groups   ]   Sharing the same love for punk music, Chavez said she pulled inspiration from bands she admired   growing up, such as X. From watching them, she learned about being an artist who is not dictated by their artistic discipline. The band X was influenced by other genres but maintained its punk edge, which she said inspired her to push her artistic ideas and find new storytelling approaches.   The play touches on themes of youthful resilience and a do-it-yourself culture that connects the Lugo family, who built and lived in the house in  1844, with a contemporary 1980s Los Angeles punk scene, Garza said. The play also wrestles with defining punk, as   he said the house burning down was emblematic of the punk era being at the height of its popularity before hardcore punk took over. He said the   narrative is focused on the main characters' abilities to embody   an independen  t mindset while making punk music with limited resources.   &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at the (Lugo) family and trying to reconsider that maybe what they were doing was actually kind of punk,&#8221; Garza said. &#8220;Because we are combining these two major historical time frames of the punk movement and early California history.&#8221;    [caption caption=""Mother and son duo Theresa Chavez and Gabriel Garza, both UCLA alumni, are co-creating, writing and directing &quot;Adobe Punk,&#8221; a play that explores the early 1980s punk rock scene.

(Courtesy of Theresa Chavez)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_376148"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   Because   both mother and son are fans of the punk era, they   aimed to accurately depict the play's musical aspects. Originating in Los Angeles, they also shared a desire to pay homage to their hometown's culture, so they enlisted the help of film composer Sage Lewis to bring their sonic vision for the play alive.  Lewis said he studied the punk music that Chavez and Garza recommended and researched the kinds of Los Angeles music that was around during the Lugo family's time more than 150 years ago, such as old Spanish American music.   &#8220;The music can influence the writing, and the scenic design and all the other elements can kind of grow together and influence the creation of the story,&#8221; Lewis said. &#8220;Before (Chavez and Garza) were writing, we were talking a lot about the idea of the characters and the world before there was really a story or characters.&#8221;   There&#8217;s an additional challenge in composing music for a play that&#8217;s already rooted in a certain sound and era of music, Lewis said. Most of his work has been reinterpreting existing works of bands like Minutemen  ,   X, Adolescents   and Blondie to fit the stage format. He created sound collages to speed up or slow down certain elements of the songs to rearrange them in a sonically pleasing way.    [Related:    Q&amp;A: Waterparks&#8217; Awsten Knight talks visual and musical conception behind latest album   ]   There is also more of a technical challenge in surgically putting together elements of songs that don&#8217;t necessarily fit together because of different tempos or chord progressions, Lewis said.   &#8220;Punk is more about the energy and the intensity of it,&#8221; Lewis said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very democratic type of egalitarian music form where anyone can pick up an instrument and know how to make a noise, and it&#8217;s sort of empowering that way.&#8221;   With Lewis behind the composition of the music that will immerse the audience into the right era, this allowed Garza and Chavez to focus more on the script and the direction of the piece. Garza said he and Chavez evenly split the writing and come together to work out the finer details. However, Garza said they also work to guide Lewis with records and playlists to fit the script.   Garza has never written a play before, but he said he has been seeking guidance and learning from his mother throughout the writing process. Chavez said it was a very touching moment for her when her son reached out about possibly working on a project, and their back-and-forth collaboration during the writing process has been very inspiring for her.   &#8220;My approach has been to sort of leave my mom hat at the door,&#8221; Chavez said. &#8220;I felt like I was just walking into another room with another artist who I trust and respect.&#8221;  ",['cap-edgerrin-panaligan'],"['arts-entertainment', 'theater-arts']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/adobepunk.png

The stories and media hysteria surrounding the affluent parents who paid for their kids' admission to prestigious universities were all anyone could talk about last year. However, a recent  internal audit further analyzing  the situation showed University of California schools didn&#8217;t just accept unqualified students as athletes &#8211; they created a system perfect for abuse.   After these applicants were accepted, the UC kept no paperwork identifying the students as special-talent admissions. And without that paper trail, there were no means of tracking the students who were accepted unethically.  The fact that wealthy families were buying the spots of hardworking students at a public university was problematic enough to cause outrage.  But this new information adds insult to injury. If the UC had done its homework, then it could potentially have caught students who came to the university under the false pretense of being an athlete. The lack of consistent oversight is a blatant flaw in the system, but it&#8217;s also a disservice to students who are working hard to keep their spots at UC schools. Even more disappointing, it seems unlikely that the UC will properly implement the audit's recommendations moving forward.   Degree auditors check students' accounts in order to track their progress at UCLA. They make sure students are enrolled in at least 12 units, are passing classes and are on the right path to graduate.   Or at least they do most of the time.   Sarah Jarso, a first-year human biology and society student, said the UC needs to put greater effort toward tracking athletic participation.  &#8220;If I don&#8217;t go to classes and I fail, I get kicked out,&#8221; Jarso said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not contributing to your team, then why are you here?&#8221;  Being a student-athlete shouldn&#8217;t be a hack in the system that allows students who have never played the sport to get into esteemed universities. The UC should have better kept track of those who were wrongfully accepted as athletes.   But this isn't just an issue of tracking an athlete&#8217;s work for the sake of making sure they are committed.   It&#8217;s the glaring frustration that students'   parents bought athletic spots at good universities and never devoted any effort. Meanwhile, there are thousands of student-athletes whose schedules and lives revolve around their practices and games.   And even for the student-athletes who do deserve to be here, their academic achievements often take a back seat in their admissions &#8211; an often-frustrating reality for other students.  Meanwhile, UCLA is patting itself on the back.  UCLA spokesperson Ricardo Vazquez said UCLA exceeded the systemwide audit recommendation set by the UC.  &#8220;For more than a decade UCLA has required that students who are admitted as athletes participate in their sport for at least a year,&#8221; Vazquez said. &#8220;UCLA recently expanded the participation requirement to two years.""  Despite UCLA going above the standard, it is not a system implemented by the entire UC. And even with its supposedly rigorous audits, UCLA is  no stranger  to students who slipped through the cracks.   In the case of the UC, inconsistency seems to be key.  Before the scandal, two UC campuses tracked team practices but had no documentation on the participation of individuals. This speaks to the UC's lackluster systemwide enforcement, which left implementation up to individual campuses.   And it plans to do the exact same thing when it comes to fixing the problem &#8211; UC President Janet Napolitano has asked individual campuses to create specific plans to address the audit's recommendations.  Because the UC only requires students to be athletes for a year, anyone could fake their way onto a team, pretend to contribute and then quit, especially when their individual work isn&#8217;t tracked.   In the end, their spots at top-flight universities   are safe, and they can claim they followed the UC guidelines.   Genesis Jackson, a first-year dance and African American studies student, said the UC's current system needs to be reassessed in order to make sure everyone in the UC earns their spot.  &#8220;They need to implement the same system UCLA has,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;I&#8217;m from the (Los Angeles Unified School) District, (where) I had to do a lot of volunteer work and keep my grades extremely high to get here.&#8221;  Of course, this entire situation might've been an honest mistake on the UC's behalf. But it should understand the number of lives it's affected because of it, especially the student-athletes who have to enroll elsewhere because greedy parents had the means to take their spots away. This should serve as a prime example for the University on what it needs to work toward improving in the future: accountability and transparency.   The system needs fixing &#8211; not just for the sake of universities avoiding embarrassing and outrageous mistakes on its behalf, but also for the sake of students who put sweat and tears into their work toward a higher education.  Because if the UC doesn&#8217;t fix the problems that go under the radar, it could find itself amid another scandal sooner than anticipated.

This summer, Marina said she plans to release at least one new single, followed by an EP early in the fall.   Her upcoming releases will blend genres   while reflecting a sincere quality of lyricism, she said.  ""My   (music) kind of ranges genres   &#8211;   some of it is more R&amp;B-leaning, some of it is more pop-leaning, some of it is all real instruments, some has more synth and subtle electronic elements,"" Marina said.

While taking piano lessons as a child, she said she began to realize her real fascination with music came from putting a personal spin on the songs. This ability to personalize music through creative instrumentation and lyricism led her into the songwriting world.  In her summer releases, Marina said she is planning on subtly incorporating more Middle Eastern sounds into her songs using traditional instruments like the duduk and doumbek. When Marina hears elements in popular music that reflect the cultural background of the artist, she said the extra layer of depth it adds   to the   songs   is what she hopes to bring into her own music.  &#8220;I recently realized (Middle Eastern and American cultures)   are both part of my identities as a person and a musician,"" Marina said. ""I've been exploring that more in production, and I've realized the soul in Middle Eastern music is so similar to the soul in R&amp;B and soul music. ... It makes perfect sense to combine those worlds.&#8221;   [Related:    UCLA student&#8217;s band independently produces upcoming EP   ]   Marina's musical background in both Western and Middle Eastern music spans back years, said Kira Magoon, one of her band members and close friends. Magoon has watched Marina develop her music and voice, which she said are soulful and expressive, since high school.   Magoon, who often plays onstage with her, said the obvious emotive quality of   Marina's voice has become a signifier of her songs.  Beyond her voice, however, Marina's bassist,   Atreyu Adams-Meacham, said her exploratory musical attitude results in innovative creations like two simultaneous bass lines. Paired with the control that Marina has over her voice, he said that combination has allowed her to establish a rich sound.  &#8220;Her vibrato and all of her little note choices are so (distinct) to her, and she has them so refined,"" Adams-Meacham said.  In addition to exploring her Middle Eastern roots with her new releases, Marina said she plans to produce the entire EP by herself &#8211; unlike the majority of her past releases, which were co-produced. Marina was initially hesitant to delve into the world of production, as she said she did not see much female representation in the industry and was unsure about blurring the lines between production and performance. However, she said her time during the stay-at-home order has granted her the chance to experiment with sound engineering.   [Related:    Student&#8217;s solo guitar EP to spin traditional jazz styles with playful style   ]     Producing her upcoming releases, which pull from R&amp;B and bedroom pop, has also helped her solidify her sound as an artist, Marina said.   By mixing genres, she hopes to   evoke a sense of unity and sonic comfort in her listeners through her new music. Despite it being a running joke between her and her friends that her songs are often sad, Marina said she ultimately hopes to reflect an uplifting but honest quality in these releases.  &#8220;Some (of these new) songs are just songs to show that, people, whatever you're feeling, chances are someone out there relates to it, and you're not alone,"" Marina said. ""Even though we're physically distant, we're all emotionally a lot more synced than we think.""

The fee waivers would be given on a first-come, first-served basis through filling out a Google form on the Undergraduate Students Association Council Financial Supports Commissions social media or  website  or by directly filling out a form at the BruinCard Center.  For my entire four years here at UCLA, I've constantly heard students struggle with the high costs of replacing their BruinCard, said Financial Supports Commissioner Millen Srivastava, who spearheaded the project. Because of the high costs of replacing a BruinCard, some students aren't able to pay for a new one and suffer for weeks because of it.  Students can lose access to their dorms, meal plans and forms of identification on campus after losing their BruinCards.  Her office received $2,000 from USAC's surplus allocations for the waiver this year, allowing it to give fee waivers to students by reducing the $25 replacement card fee to just $10. The program will run until June 1, or until all are exhausted for the year.  Students will have five business days to collect their subsidized card, otherwise their waiver will be ineffective and they will be unable to receive one for this academic year.  The participants of the BruinCard fee waiver program will be students, and their opinions are manifold.  I am very grateful that we are able to introduce this program to our students, said Buddy Al-Aydi, a second-year English student. BruinCards are so easily lost and misplaced and it can be such a financial burden to replace it, especially for students who need every penny to pay for housing and food.  He added that he thinks this is a step in the right direction to making BruinCard replacements more accessible and affordable to everyone.  Despite some student support, others think the program should be restricted to a need-based system.  I dont think that everybody should get the fee waiver, said Stephanie Perez, a third-year biology student in a statement. Its not fair because everybodys financial situations are different. The FSC should focus on putting the money toward getting the administration to lower the replacement fee costs and for the students that need the service, not just want it.  The BruinCard Center charges the replacement fee because it relies heavily on the fees to run and function as an office, a BruinCard Center representative said.  Srivastava said she is working on receiving annual funding for this program so it can occur on a yearly basis. As of now, the subsidy is a one-time allocation from her office.  She added that this program is just one step in the right direction toward reducing BruinCard costs. The ultimate goal, Srivastava said, is to have the BruinCard Center lower the replacement fee costs on an administrative level.",['cap-christina-williams'],"['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.news_.bruincardfeewaivers.file_.jpg

No. 2 UCLA women's water polo (19-2, 2-0 MPSF) secured two wins over the weekend, with a score of 11-5 over No. 8 California (11-7, 0-2) Saturday and 13-8 against No. 23 Pacific (3-13, 1-1 GCC) on Sunday.  Saturdays match was the first meeting between California and UCLA this season. Sophomore center Ava Johnson said that though the Bruins werent completely sure what to expect, they were not intimidated.  We had to come out with a go-get-them mentality and show them everything we had, Johnson said. We couldnt really lapse in any way because we werent sure how it would turn out.  UCLA started off slow in the first 15 minutes, with California matching two UCLA goals with two of its own. The Bruins found their stride after the first frame, outscoring the Bears by two goals in each quarter after that.  Four different Bruins each scored twice, including Johnson, sophomore utility Katrina Drake, sophomore attacker Val Ayala and junior attacker Roxy Wheaton.  On the defensive side, UCLA held California to a .185 shooting percentage and did not allow the Bears to convert any of their 10 power play opportunities. Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Georgia Phillips played the entire match, recording eight saves.  UCLA continued its defensive intensity through the first half of the match against Pacific. While the Bruins put away eight goals, they only allowed one goal .  Johnson tied her career-high of four goals against the Tigers alongside an assist, and credited her achievement to her teammates and some luck.  (I had the) confidence going into the game, knowing that (my) teammates are going to do everything they can to get my position (as) center, the ball. Johnson said. Obviously, I was open and in a good position, but that could have been anyone.  However, the Tigers gained momentum after halftime, scoring two goals in the third quarter before matching the Bruins goal for goal in the fourth, with each team scoring five times.  We dropped our presence and let them get back into the game, Johnson said. We definitely dont want to do that. Our coach and even our team were pretty let down for allowing that to happen.  Both teams had experience against each other, as this was the third meeting of the season. The Bruins won all three matches, but the Tigers were most successful in this match with eight goals.  We knew their strengths, their weaknesses, Johnson said. I think that definitely played into their hands a little bit because they knew us as well.  As a veteran of the team, junior attacker Lexi Liebowitz said she has felt the pressure of these situations before and knows how to stay focused on the future instead of the past.

We were munching on bagels, when, out of nowhere, he said:  You know whats funny? My friends always make fun of me for only dating Asian girls.  As an Asian American woman, I found this interesting to hear from my white friend. He went on to describe his past girlfriends, and they only seemed to share one thing: ethnicity. I couldnt help but think, is this yellow fever?  After looking into the subject, The Quad found some of the reasonings behind why people may have these dating preferences  and that they are just one of the many manifestations of stereotypes held about Asian women both on college campuses and across the country.  So what exactly is yellow fever?  Yellow fever is defined as a sexual fetish rooted in racialized and gendered stereotypes, most commonly held by white men for Asian and Asian American women, said Kyeyoung Park, an associate professor of anthropology and Asian American studies.  If we view some of these stereotypes about Asians, particularly women but also men, theyre mostly shy, submissive and conformist, Park said.  As Asian American women ourselves, we were fully aware of this stereotype. And as students at a university filled with young adults meeting and interacting with people of different backgrounds, it's especially hard not to take notice of yellow fever as an underlying influence in many of our peers' dating habits.    In speaking to Thu-hng Nguyn-v, an associate professor in the Department of Asian Languages &amp; Cultures,   the narratives of Asian feminization and rebellion   are often   created by those who seek power and are   sustained by those in power.     According to Nguyn-v, in the early days of exploration in the 15th century, Europeans had already begun applying gender tropes in order to understand and act upon the land they were ""discovering"" in feminized, and therefore racialized, terms. Because the female identity was so closely tied to submission and weakness, applying this characteristic to the   continent   granted the explorers a   sense of ability to control and master it, Nguyn-v said.     Through this, Asia became imagined as a land of the ""other,"" the ""Oriental""  a dynamic that feminized and sexualized the Asian female, said Min Zhou, a professor in sociology and Asian American studies.  This gendered imagination of the Asian continent did not exclude Asian men. Nguyn-v references the book Imperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Contest by Anne McClintock ,  citing its exploration of this gendered and sexualized dynamic in relation to early colonialism. McClintock argues that colonialism is the basis for why and how both men and women in Asia become feminized, in effect emasculating Asian men. In that dynamic, the Asian woman becomes sexually available for white men.  Similarly, in the beginnings of French colonialism in Vietnam, French officials writing reports on French Indochina would comment on the perversion of gender roles that they had deemed traditional, Nguyn-v said. Vietnamese women in the north were bigger, taller and did all the physical labor. Vietnamese men in the north were smaller and performed little to no physical labor, Nguyn-v added.     This gender role reversal was reasoned as the marker of lack of civilization, Nguyn-v said. The French had to restore a civilizational order to Vietnam and right the wrongs of this gender hierarchy. Its not always that (Western society) see Asian women as submissive, small and weak, but also as threats, since they were bigger, stronger and more active in society.  [caption id=""attachment_380543"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""843""]    (Aileen Nguyen/Graphics editor)[/caption]  Beyond the historical patterns, we also see these mixed-race and intercultural relationships play out in historical literature, further enabling Western-created stereotypes of Asian docility.  The Italian opera Madama Butterfly tells the story of an American G.I. who falls in love with a Japanese woman while stationed in Japan. The woman kills herself when he must leave. Similarly, the musical Miss Saigon is set in Vietnam and is a less critical iteration of Madama Butterfly. However, it features the same racial and romantic dynamic, according to Nguyn-v.  The contexts (of 'Madama Butterfly' and 'Miss Saigon') are very similar  an American military presence and the soldier being a representation of that imperial militaristic power that is marked as masculine, Nguyn-v said. The relationship between a figure like that and an Asian woman is in the context where Asia is supposed to be saved by American imperial militarism.  This Western militaristic might seems to have begun a process of gendering and sexualizing the Asian identity, paving the way for yellow fever as we know it.  (American imperial militarism) works on the same cultural logic and imagining about the gendered other  that Asian woman are sex dolls or submissive, Nguyn-v said. When theyre not submissive, they fit into this stereotype of the dragon lady.  A historic example of an Asian woman who strayed from the stereotype of submissiveness is exemplified in Madame Nhu, the sister-in-law of the Republic of Vietnams president, who played a heavy-handed role in governing. When asked by the American press in 1963 about a Buddhist monk who self-immolated as a form of protest, she reasoned that he had barbecued himself and that she would offer additional gasoline to Buddhists if need be.  The American press and public alike soon dubbed Nhu as a dragon lady. She was outspoken, and unfearfully so, and did not conform to the Western idea of the submissive Asian woman, Nguyn-v said.  As we shift from Western presence in Asian countries to focus on Asian immigration to Western countries later in history, gender stereotypes relating to Asian men and women seem to have remained in many forms.  During industrialization, Chinese workers were brought to the United States in the 18th century to work on the transcontinental railroad. They were immediately placed in a subordinate position, according to Zhou.  Much of the Chinese immigration to the United States was made up of male workers who were stereotyped as being feminine for wearing pigtails. Few women were brought in, but those who were came as slaves and sex workers.  This began perception of Asian women as sexual and men as asexual, Zhou said. Men were never treated as a desirable being with masculinity. Even in early novels, women were described as different and exotic.  As it turns out, the Asian female identity of being ""different and exotic"" is the basis and driving force behind their appeal in the context of yellow fever today. According to Park, middle-class white women are the standard of beauty in Western society and are therefore normalized. Conversely, minority women are seen as different and deviant and, through this, desirable.  Theres the theory of desire: People tend to desire what they cant have, so its natural that human beings are curious about other human beings different backgrounds, Park said. Minority women are seen as deviant, but at the same time, they attract temptation because people are curious and interested, maybe sexually, about others.  Yellow fever, it seems, may be rooted in a desire to know the unknown. The Asian woman, through her supposed   exoticism and deviance, draws intrigue. She is thought of as traditional and submissive in ways that the middle-class white woman, who is thought of as liberated and independent, is not, Zhou said.     Asian men may be equally subjected to yellow fever. In the same way that Western imperialism targeted and feminized Asian women, so it did to Asian men as well.  In David Henry Hwangs play M. Butterfly, he suggested that all aspects of Asia were feminized in this militaristic conquest, including Asian men. According to Nguyn-v, the white man who colonizes imagines the Asian ""other"" as one that is interchangeable; men and women were equalized by femininity, with mistaking a man for a woman becoming part of this cultural dynamic.  ""To be taught at a young age that someone likes you because of a 'fetish' tells you that you are by nature strange, abnormal,"" Tria Chang wrote in  HuffPost . ""I internalized: To be attracted to me was to have some sort of perversion. And so I learned to think of all Asians as less desirable.""  In coming to terms with this stereotype, Asian women may also imagine the gendered other  in this case, the gendered Asian male  in the same way that Western imperial militarism historically has. For instance, in terms of media representation, we seldom see Asian male actors play romantic leads, Park said.  Unfortunately, the Western imperialistic curation of the Asian and Asian American identity as one that is feminine and subservient seems to trickle down to the modern-day.  As legends metamorphose from books and plays to movies and on-demand TV shows, so have the tales of women from the East.    As discussed above, Asian women may be portrayed in media as either a docile sexual object or a dragon lady. The insinuation is that Asian women do not amount to enough to be fully fleshed out, empathetic characters.   ""The insinuation is that Asian women do not amount to enough to be fully fleshed out, empathetic characters."" An article from  The Guardian  gathered Asian actors to recount racist barriers they encountered in Hollywood. The article discussed problematic breakdowns of Asian characters, like a female Asian character who is ""really only good at being pretty"" and an Asian female description being followed by traits like ""petite,"" ""slim"" and ""fragile.""  Japanese American comedian and actress Atsuko Okatsuka remembered being called in to portray roles like a Japanese schoolgirl  roles that she felt did not fit her  and the demeaning process in auditioning for it.  ""I had to squeal a lot and speak in a very high-pitched cadence in Japanese. And giggle,"" Okatsuka said in the article.  [caption id=""attachment_380544"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Shari Wei/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  Now, everyday Asian women are speaking out about these problematic representations.  Skylar Zhao, a third-year psychology and sociology student, feels as though portrayals that draw from stereotypes feed into fetishism, and this usually stems from Western movies and media being shot from an objectifying white male gaze.  As we enter the present day and examine   where the Asian identity stands within Western dating culture, we can see that when it is perceived through a narrow lens, like in media portrayals, it can affect Asian women in every aspect of their lives. For some UCLA students, it seems that yellow fever is alive and well, though for them it has changed from an imperialistic tactic to microaggressive dating preferences.   [Related:    The Quad: Exploring the culture surrounding the subtle asian dating Facebook page ]      Zhao agreed the phenomenon exoticizes Asian people and focuses on generalizing stereotypes, like the assumed docile, mysterious nature of Asian women.  ""Yellow fever is also a reductionist move which sees Asian girls based on their race and not their personality, which is inherently racist, Zhao said.   ""Yellow fever is also a reductionist move which sees Asian girls based on their race and not their personality, which is inherently racist, Zhao said. A lack of accurate portrayals may be interconnected with other aspects that maintain yellow fever; for example, the cultural differences between Western and Eastern societies.  Hope Safranek, a fourth-year statistics major, reflected on her experiences living in Taiwan, where her mother is from. She witnessed a subtle cultural difference between Taiwan, and other Asian countries, and Western culture.  I feel like (in America) we promote this idea of individualism whereas in a lot of other Asian countries it's about the family, about the entire entity, rather than the person, Safranek said.  The notion Safranek addressed has been studied in sociology: Eastern cultures generally  tend to be more collectivist  than individualist Western cultures, associating actions not just with the individual, but their family and community, according to some studies.     In turn, Safranek believes there is less shame in America to pursue taboo fetishes, which she said may otherwise be suppressed in Asian cultures.  I think because of those deeply rooted cultural differences, (the aspect of shame) transformed and yellow fever blossomed through that, Safranek said.  Zhao had an additional approach to analyzing the effect of cultural differences. While cultures across seas are different, those who express dual identities from both sides can feel even more impacted by the phenomenon.  Asian Americans are racially triangulated in a way that Asians tend to feel alienated despite growing up in America all their life,"" Zhao said. ""Yellow fever definitely makes it worse since it is creating an image of a foreign mysterious girl despite that they have lived here all their lives.""  Zhou also commented on the exaggerated effects of yellow fever on Asian Americans.  I would argue that, growing up here, you are more affected by the negative impact of this stereotyping than international students are,"" Zhou said. ""International students, once they are here and encounter the racialized system, would be just as equally affected. However, they already have a very strong identity before they come here, unlike the children who are born here.""  While those who grow up in America versus in Asia share different experiences, so do those who have grown up in different generations.  Chapal Barua, a fourth-year human biology and society student, said that yellow fever can be perpetuated by older, non-Asian generations carrying stereotypical perceptions and sharing those learned beliefs with Asian girls.  I have a lot of older people tell me lots of random inappropriate things just to spark up a conversation. ... Oh, you're Indian right? You must know how to take care of your future husband. I hear you guys treat them like gods, Barua said.  According to Safranek, her Taiwanese mother also supports this idea of a generational, ideological divide, with older generations holding onto traditional ideas related to yellow fever like a sexist and controlling attitude.  However, she remarked that the generational divide may also be the turning point for problems like yellow fever.  (My mom) said that, in our generation, men feel like they have less control over women than they used to. I think that's because of the media, movements and marches. We are really able to voice ourselves and demand respect, while before it wasn't like that, Safranek said.  However, there are still experiences that illustrate the progress we need to make in our own generation. Safranek encountered an inebriated peer who targeted her mixed-race identity.  I remember how he was talking about how he would love to hook up with a mixed girl. I was just like, Im so uncomfortable right now,"" Safranek said. ""And that was this guys goal. ... That just blew my mind.  To Safranek, yellow fever seems to feed off a larger problem of overpowering masculinity and its sense of control. Women may feel wary of how to handle confrontations like these.  Because as a woman, he probably didnt expect me to say anything back. And as a woman, unfortunately, I didnt say anything back. ... I think it tied into this fear that I didnt want any conflict, Safranek said.  With that in mind, Safranek and others believe the most effective, long-term way to bring problems like the fetishism and exoticism of Asian women to the forefront is to work through the bigger, overarching movement of feminism.   [Related:  Subtle Asian Traits ]   Over time, Asian women have been able to speak up more because of the feminist movement and because of how it progressively becomes more inclusive, Safranek said.  As Safraneks mother noted, generational differences have the potential to give way to changing beliefs. The incorporation of countering yellow fever into feminism may have been brought on by these differences seen in second-generation Asian Americans who, as mentioned before, feel more alienated in their country.  In turn, Asian American women who have grown up in the United States may facilitate the progression of sociopolitical moments for those less likely to speak up.   Because as a woman, he probably didnt expect me to say anything back. And as a woman, unfortunately, I didnt say anything back. ... I think it tied into this fear that I didnt want any conflict, Safranek said. For the native-born, their political consciousness is stronger, and their desire and drive to make a claim to this land as theirs is stronger, Zhou said.  Despite their hard work in adapting to and integrating into the American socioeconomic sphere, Asian Americans may still face difficulty in shedding the  quiet, submissive character  to which they have historically been confined.  In many cases,  socioeconomic achievement    across the Asian American population is higher than that of the average American population. However, mainstream media largely fails to represent these achievements, demoting Asian Americans as secondary, Park said. This may be an unfortunate indication of the intersection of the model minority myth and the bamboo ceiling, a term coined by author   Jane Hyun to describe Asian American career barriers.  In an article in The New York Times Style Magazine, author Thessaly La Force sees the bamboo ceiling in the overall perception that Asian Americans lack the brilliance or intuition needed in the American workplace, and are therefore less likely to be promoted into managerial positions.  In the end, my initial question of whether that simple conversation over breakfast was yellow fever turned into a larger realization of its ties to centuries worth of misconceptions. It doesn't seem to be as innocent as the way people romantically approach others but rather as the way they have been conditioned by society to view groups of people.  There is hope that, by addressing the tendency people may have to see romantic partners first by their appearance and what characteristics they believe always come with these appearances, other issues of racial microaggressions can also be recognized for their daily impacts.  And we are already making strides, Zhou said.  ""The second generation is doing much better,"" Zhou said. ""Given time, the Asian American community will be more vocal.""","['cap-cecile-wu', 'cap-audrey-pham']","['campus-quad', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/aileen-nguyen.png

From flyering on Bruin Walk to hosting debate watch parties, Bruins for Bernie, Bruins for Warren and Bruins for Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out March 1, have made efforts to drum up excitement on campus for their respective candidates.  The three candidates have resonated with college students not just at UCLA, but across the nation, said political science lecturer Ajax Peris.  Students support these candidates because they are all calling for drastic change, Peris said.  &#8220;(With) each of these (candidates) it's like, 'Hey, we want to grab America by the shoulders, shake it,' and say &#8216;Let's do this, let's make this better,&#8217;"" Peris said.   Younger voters are more likely to find that approach appealing, Peris said. Older voters, however, tend to be a little more pragmatic.  &#8220;(Older voters) have been around the election cycle a few times, and they see that we get different leaders in, they come and they go, and not a lot changes because politics is more evolutionary than revolutionary,&#8221; Peris said. &#8220;But younger voters are still excited about this idea of &#8216;We know what we need to do, let's just go do it,&#8217; even if that may not be the most realistic approach.&#8221;  Bruins for Bernie has had conversations with about 1,200 students about the election, said one of its club leaders, third-year geography/environmental studies student Dylan Portillo. He said he believes Sen. Bernie Sanders from Vermont's appeal is a product of his health care and immigration policies, as well as his plan to cancel all student loan debt.  His honesty also sets him apart, Portillo said.  &#8220;He reminds us of our grandpa,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not a racist one, but a really fun one in the sense that he gives a lot of us hope in a system that we know doesn't really work for us.&#8221;  Similarly, one of the club leaders of Bruins for Warren, third-year political science student Walker Cook, said Sen. Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts' success among the college demographic stems from her focus on issues that affect students&#8217; daily lives. Among these topics are climate change, student debt, pay inequity, gun violence and housing, Cook said.  &#8220;What makes her unique in the field is that, even though she's only been in elected office since 2012, even before then, she's gotten so much done legislatively that has so substantively improved people's lives,&#8221; Cook said. &#8220;She's someone to believe in.&#8221;  As a newcomer to the national political scene, former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg had the potential for a large college student backing, said Jago Goddard, co-founder of Bruins for Pete Buttigieg and third-year computer science and engineering student.  Goddard said the club&#8217;s greatest success thus far has been in spreading Buttigieg&#8217;s message to students who otherwise might not have heard of him at all.  Bruins for Pete Buttigieg had a little over 1,600 followers on Twitter &#8211; the largest Twitter following of the three clubs. Social media is effective for connecting to students and spreading Buttigieg&#8217;s message more quickly, said Melinda Berman, the communications director of Bruins for Pete Buttigieg and a third-year atmospheric and oceanic sciences student.  Although Buttigieg was lesser known and lacked the experience in national government of other candidates, Goddard said he believes Buttigieg was unique in his ability to bring voters together from across the aisle.  Although the California presidential primary polls will close March 3, the clubs plan to continue its efforts until the president-elect is chosen in November.  In accordance with the ""Friendship2020&#8221; hashtag coined at the beginning of the primary race, the three organizations have agreed to support whichever candidate wins the nomination. The groups have already begun to show support for one another by co-hosting debate watch parties.  At the end, although the primaries may be ugly, one of the candidates will be the Democratic nominee, Cook said.  &#8220;We're all going to have to back them, or (President) Donald Trump is going to get reelected,&#8221; Cook said. &#8220;So I think we all have this understanding that ... we have to do for that person what we would do if our chosen candidate were the nominee.

No. 20 UCLA rowing is slated to start its 2020 season Saturday at the Marina Aquatic Center versus San Diego State. This will mark the second year in a row in which the Bruins will take on the Aztecs to start their season.  UCLA previously defeated San Diego State in its first meet of 2019, starting off last season with a victory.  This year, the Bruins hope to do the same, but with a different squad. Last year's UCLA team graduated a class of 12 players, including then-seniors starboard Kyra Edwards and port Saskia Budgett. They both went on to represent Great Britain at the World Rowing Championships in fall &#8211; Edwards at the senior level and Budgett as an alternate.  ""The freshman class has been filling in our top seats, and any of our returners stepping up has been amazing to see,&#8221; said coach Amy Fuller Kearney.  Port Fiona Buzzard is one of only four seniors on the team and said the senior class is excited to kick off its final season, embracing their new roles as leaders on the squad.  ""We lead by example, but when you have a younger class, you do have to be a bit more vocal,"" Buzzard said.  UCLA enters the season ranked in the top 20 nationally and is one of five ranked teams from the Pac-12 conference, which has produced the last four national champions. Reigning champion Washington is ranked No. 1 in the country, followed by Stanford at No. 2. Rounding out the rankings are No. 6 California and No. 18 USC.  The Bruins narrowly missed out on the 2019 NCAA championship after placing 4th at the Pac-12 championship, not high enough to qualify.   &#8220;Last year, I felt really bad for the seniors because we definitely deserved to be at the NCAA championship, there&#8217;s no doubt about it, but that&#8217;s done now,&#8221; Fuller Kearney said. &#8220;We have to focus on this young team and this energy to be in contention this spring.&#8221;  UCLA went 2-1 last season in dual meets, beating San Diego State and Loyola Marymount but losing to USC. They also competed in the San Diego Crew Classic and the Windermere Cup in Seattle during the regular season, ending the year at the Pac-12 championship in Gold River, California.  &#8220;A year of reflection and gratitude, so much to be grateful for,&#8221;  Fuller Kearney said.

Then, when UCLA&#8217;s bats fell silent, Azevedo returned the favor.  &#8220;(Azevedo) wasn&#8217;t the sharpest in that first inning,&#8221; Inouye-Perez said. &#8220;But the offense had (Azevedo's) back and that makes (Azevedo) want to fight, so she started settling in.&#8221;  Azevedo allowed two walks and an RBI single in the opening inning of No. 1 UCLA softball&#8217;s (22-1) 4-2 victory over No. 22 UCF (17-5) on Friday night. It was the second time all season the Bruins fell behind on the scoreboard before holding the bat in their hands.  In the bottom half of the first inning, with junior utility Kinsley Washington on second, UCF bypassed UCLA&#8217;s batting average leader redshirt junior outfielder Aaliyah Jordan with an intentional four-pitch walk. After freshman infielder Maya Brady flied out to left field for the second out of the inning, Inouye-Perez said UCF thought the inning was over.  Then junior infielder Delanie Wisz walked to the plate, and, on a 2-2 count, unloaded a three-run home run over the right-field batting cages.  &#8220;Just when (the Knights) think they got out of it, getting (Brady) out, (Wisz) comes up and just comes up clutch,&#8221; Inouye-Perez said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what UCLA softball is about &#8211; our ability to pick each other up.""  In Azevedo&#8217;s second inning of work, she again allowed the first batter she faced to reach base, and she would eventually come around to score on a hit that deflected off Wisz&#8217;s glove and trickled into the outfield to trim the Bruins&#8217; lead to 3-2.  UCLA extended its lead back to two runs with help from sophomore outfielder Kelli Godin in the bottom half of the inning. Godin took advantage of an error to get on base, then proceeded to steal her team-leading 12th base of the season and tag up on two straight flyouts to score and give Azevedo additional run support.  But the Bruin lineup was stifled as the Knights turned to their ace Alea White &#8211; who had recorded the win in UCF&#8217;s upset win over No. 16 Michigan earlier in the evening &#8211; to stop the bleeding with two outs in the second. White held the Bruins scoreless down the stretch, racking up four strikeouts in the process.  &#8220;White, (who) had just gone in, had all (types of) pitches,&#8221; Inouye-Perez said. &#8220;She was changing planes, she had a good off-speed. She&#8217;s one of the better pitchers we&#8217;ve faced this year. ... I didn&#8217;t even know who she was, and now I do.&#8221;  In addition to White&#8217;s four-inning shutout performance, Inouye-Perez said the Knights' defense played much more soundly after picking up two errors in the first two innings.  &#8220;I like the way (the Knights) play,&#8221; Inouye-Perez said.  &#8220;They started making some defensive plays. ... I think they were a really balanced team. That was a great competitive game. You&#8217;re going to see that team in the postseason going to be able to do some stuff.&#8221;  Azevedo responded to White's dominance with consecutive 1-2-3 innings in the third and fourth innings, allowing only two hits for the remainder of the game.  ""I had to adjust, so I think it&#8217;s all about, &#8216;Does your team have your back?'&#8221; Azevedo said. &#8220;If I give up a hit, we&#8217;ll come back, so I&#8217;m not really worried about a rough start. I know they have my back, and I&#8217;ll have their back.&#8221;  Assisting Azevedo in recording the final two outs was Wisz, who picked up assists on a pair of on-the-run defensive plays to end the game.  Wisz, who had a running catch in front of the third-base dugout earlier in the game, said she takes more pride in her defensive prowess than the long ball she launched in the opening frame.  ""Honestly, (I) probably (value) the defense (more),"" Wisz said. ""That&#8217;s how you win championships. Just making those plays behind (Azevedo) was really special.""

After spring quarter was moved online, the UCLA theater company transitioned three of their one-act plays from the stage to   online   streaming, offering an opportunity for the company to explore new skill sets and storytelling dynamics. Though the canceled live performances were disappointing, third-year international development student and writer Bea Cuenco said she was grateful for how hard the company worked to make sure the show could go on.  ""People call us a theater company, but what they don't see is the special family aspect of it, Cuenco said. We're all creators, but we're also family first, and we help each other grow, both artistically and personally. ... (We're) not going to just let our artwork be stifled because of the pandemic, we still find ways to showcase our art.""   [Related:    The laughs continue via Zoom with UCLA's student-run comedy club   ]   Once it became clear their spring live show was no longer feasible, fourth-year economics student Melissa Francikiewicz said she and other LCC producers began brainstorming other ways to showcase the stories they had planned to present. They were inspired by other productions and companies who were doing Zoom table reads and podcast plays,   and eventually the company   opted to use an audio format to present some   of the   plays in the scheduled spring show  .      ""Lapu's Pocket Theatre,"" named for LCC's coyote mascot, will   include   three thematically different   plays with one episode each.   The Fan Page is a romantic comedy about a girl   crushing on her schools morning announcement host, while Other Motives is a noir-inspired tale of murder and mystery. Dion Majabe plays with time to tell an epic love story in the midst of war.  Each   of the   disparate stories were conceived and written before the decision to move the show online, but Cuenco, who wrote The Fan Page, said her story hardly   needed any adaptation to become podcast-ready because the focus was more on dialogue than the physical production elements. ""The Fan Page was inspired by Cuencos own experience creating a fan page for her schools morning announcement host in high school. She said the real-life anchor who inspired the story knew about the play and enjoyed it.  Second-year communication   student Patrick Zhang also drew from his life when writing Dion Majabe. He started penning the play in fall quarter but stopped because of a   lack of inspiration, which he found while studying abroad in France during winter quarter. He said he often   went to the Louvre Museum and was struck by the fact that despite being considered a bastion for art masterpieces,   the museum was dominated by Greco-Roman art and presented a largely Eurocentric point of view.  ""I wanted to make a piece that follows the same tradition as a Greco-Roman tragedy, but instead (put) people of color in place of the typically white, rich, aristocratic characters, Zhang said. (I wanted to promote) the idea that other people from a non-Western perspective can be celebrated in the same type of way that white people have been for centuries.""   [Related:    Professor's podcast explores technological, social innovation in music industry   ]   In addition to writing a play, Zhang is also co-directing the production of Other Motives, which has its rehearsals occurring   on Zoom. And while his co-director focused more on the technical aspect of the play, Zhang said he gravitated toward character work, fleshing out characters' motivations in the story   despite the   limitations of Zoom.  ""You lose that direct intimate energy that is often exchanged when you're acting face to face, Zhang said. Plus there's internet issues, lags that often disrupt or slow the scene, but I think that overall, we managed to overcome a lot of that stuff with editing to make the scenes flow better.  Despite some of the technical challenges, LCC members were able to find some unexpected positives in the shift to audio as a performance medium.   Francikiewicz, who is also acting in The Fan Page, said the company was able to put more time into creative and skill-based workshops this quarter because they didnt have to worry about putting on a big production. She said the workshops on voice acting helped her focus on finding her characters vocal quality  playing around with pitch, speed and enunciation.  The casts have also   been finding their voices collectively by rehearsing over Zoom, and they will read together for the final recording of the podcast.   However, each person will record dialogue on their own devices to be edited together for the final podcasts, which will be available in the coming weeks, said Francikiewicz.    Though the finished product will lack the visuals that typically accompany a LCC production, Cuenco said   the podcast format shifts the focus from spectacle to dialogue.  ""The only thing you can really do is listen to the words, and I think through the words, that's where I really poured my heart out in, Cuenco said. I'm just really appreciative that that's the center element of this art form, so people can just really listen.""",['cap-olivia-mazzucato'],"['arts-entertainment', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/06/Film_Noir.jpg

Sridhar finally realized her idea with the inaugural Health for Heritage Week from Feb. 22 to Feb. 28, which was an 11-event collaboration of the Student Wellness Commission and various clubs.  The week included discussions and presentations about the intersection of culture and health, a hygiene drive, an interactive art gallery, a beach cleanup and a CPR class.  Sridhar, a fourth-year microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics student, planned the event with Sophia McMurry, a fourth-year philosophy student and SWC platforms director, and reached out to almost 100 student organizations. Once they narrowed down their list, they pushed for the SWC subcommittees to reach out to the organizations that sparked their interest.  Sridhar said her goal for the week was to push for collaborations between organizations that might not have come in contact otherwise.  A lot of times people can get sort of pigeonholed, Sridhar said. I think collaboration is a really great way to impact a greater number of people who may not have originally ever been privy to even knowing that an event was happening or that a topic is of interest to them.  Health for Heritage Week kicked off Feb. 22 with a beach cleanup co-hosted by SWC Environmental Awareness, Recycling and Terrestrial Health and the Indian Student Union. Around 200 pieces of trash were collected over a span of two hours from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Beach.  Kiera Dixon, the co-director of SWC EARTH, said that students were handed trash bags and forms to record the types of trash collected. The cleanup allowed students from different backgrounds to bond through environmental beautification efforts, she said.  I feel like its very important to be exposed to different types of cultures and establish friendships with people of different heritages, said Dixon, a fourth-year molecular, cell, and developmental biology student.  Another event that hoped to expose students to new cultural knowledge was organized by SWC's Student Education And Research of Contemporary Health along with Movimiento Estudiantil Chicana/o de Aztln de UCLA. These two organizations collaborated to create conversations about Latinx culture, relationships and intimacy through answering anonymous questions from a box. Other activities included making love potions and meditation.  Tara Shooshani, co-chair of SEARCH, said the event was inspired by Latinx cultural traditions. The two clubs wanted the event to be a celebration of these traditions to share with the UCLA community.  I think the main takeaway is for people to have a renewed respect and interest in other cultures to be interested in learning about other peoples traditions and customs, said Shooshani, a fourth-year human biology and society student.  SEARCH also partnered with the Afrikan Student Union to hold Unpacking Medical Racism, a three-speaker panel regarding the topic of medical racism. Speakers talked about the history of racism in the medical field and why it continues to this day.  Kylie Paramore, a panelist at the event, does research within the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health to uncover the subconscious racial bias on the health outcomes of black patients. She said the more discussion and research on the topic, the more inclined the health care system is to change this problem.  A lot of times, were fed this false narrative that our society is so progressive and colorblind ... but unfortunately, thats just not true, said Paramore, a fourth-year African American studies student. We have to have these conversations because these conversations are about real life.  To address the intersection of mental wellness and Pilipino culture, Active Minds and Pilipinos for Community Health co-hosted an event called Utakatawan: Physical x Mental Health in the Pilipino Community. The event incorporated Pilipino food, dance and a cappella performances, a panel and a presentation.  Three undergraduates and two graduate students participated in the panel to share how they have overcome struggles that pervade Pilipino culture.  With our culture there's this word called hiya, which translates to shame, as well as to be shy, said Robi Bucayu, who spoke on the panel. We're not good at seeking help or talking about our feelings, so I think this forum really helps to dispel that culture of silence.  Vernadette Laderas, a second-year psychology student, said that it was refreshing to hear raw conversations about taboo topics within Pilipino culture.  There's definitely trends within the culture, like ... constantly giving and giving, and waiting until it's too late to start to take care of yourself, (which) is something that I have struggled with, specifically with my mom, Laderas said. It ... surprised me to hear anecdotes that sound almost exactly like mine.  In another effort to promote mental wellness, Total Wellness and Southeast Asian Campus Learning Education and Retention hosted an event that consisted of five stations to prompt reflection on the negative effects of social media.  The first of five stations asked participants to rate their happiness and provided tips on how to foster a healthier relationship with social media. Other stations asked students what makes them happy outside of social media and which part of their body is their favorite.  It's important to recognize how (social media) might be affecting you, even though you don't realize it because you think it's a necessity, and then take the steps to use it and in a healthier way, said Rebeca Gasper, a second-year political science and communication student.  Sridhar and McMurry said they hoped different cultural communities would gain insight into each others various health needs.  I really hope that committees and the other students who do attend these events just make meaningful and thoughtful connections with other groups on campus and hopefully (that) continues throughout the year,"" McMurry said.","['cap-kaitlin-browne', 'cap-megan-mccallister']","['campus', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.news_.heritageweek2020.ASY_.jpg

This experience, along with other dating horror stories from her and her friends&#8217; lives, has gone on to influence her characters, she said. Gruenenfelder, a women&#8217;s fiction and romantic comedy writer, has published six books. Her first novel &#8220;A Total Waste of Makeup&#8221; was published in 2005, and she   recently turned in her seventh work to her agent. The alumna said she writes about the   common struggles women share and also tries to highlight female characters in their 40s who are often overshadowed in the genre by stories about younger women.  &#8220;I unapologetically write for women &#8211; I write about dating, I write about wanting to have kids,&#8221; Gruenenfelder said. &#8220;I wrote about turning 30 and feeling like everybody else was ahead of me, and ('A Total Waste of Makeup') I think was successful because a lot of women feel that way.&#8221;   [Related:    Alumna author imbues fiction with scientific rigor, feminist principles   ]   Gruenenfelder's characters are often based on her own life stories, she said.   Jennifer Coburn, another contemporary women&#8217;s fiction author and friend of Gruenenfelder&#8217;s, said they became acquainted after she read &#8220;A Total Waste of Makeup.&#8221; Drawn to the book's   comedy, Coburn said Gruenenfelder&#8217;s readers can find the humor and lightness in shared experiences with the characters, such as frustrations in one's dating life.  When Gruenenfelder was 29, she was the maid of honor in two weddings, watched friends become increasingly successful screenwriters and had a friend expecting a baby, she said. She felt happy for them, although Gruenenfelder said she felt behind in her career and personal life.    In &#8220;A Total Waste of Makeup,&#8221; the protagonist, Charlie, has similar feelings as the maid of honor at her younger sister&#8217;s wedding, experiencing some of the insecurities Gruenenfelder had during weddings   when she wasn't dating anyone, she said.  &#8220;What I was trying to show was just because you feel like you&#8217;re behind right now, it doesn&#8217;t mean you are,"" she said. ""It just means things aren&#8217;t looking the way you thought they would, and that&#8217;s OK.&#8221;   As Gruenenfelder&#8217;s personal and professional life has changed since 2005, she said she wanted to write about the experiences of     older women. Whitney Dineen, her friend who is also an author, said Gruenenfelder is now married with a son in college. She is writing about what she is more familiar with in this stage of her life, Dineen said, displayed in her most recent 2018 novel, ""Hangovers &amp; Hot Flashes.""  In the book, one character dreads feeling empty as her twins are soon going to college, having known couples who feel unsure about their future after the youngest child leaves home. She also wrote about one of her characters experiencing early menopause and a third character who is going through a divorce.  One reason why she wrote ""Hangovers &amp; Hot Flashes"" was to continue writing about her life experiences past the age of 30, as many of her fans have grown older alongside her, she said.  By writing books about women in their 40s and sending them out to publishers, Gruenenfelder said   she is filling the gap for older women who are not often the focus of romantic comedies. Coburn said it is important to realize that women in their 40s also have humorous experiences and lessons to teach women in their 20s, just like women in their 20s have insightful perspectives to share.  &#8220;To be so youth focused is to the detriment of all women, because we cheat 20-year-old women out of the experience of getting to know us 40-plus-year-old women,&#8221; Coburn said. &#8220;We erase older women, and my God, the world does a good enough job erasing us.&#8221;   [Related:    Alumnae produce absurdist rom-com to reflect queer experiences in dating   ]   Even though she was advised to write another book about women in their 30s, she chose not to and wrote ""Hangovers &amp; Hot Flashes,"" which initially was turned down by several publishers. Editors mentioned they loved the book and could relate to the storylines, but their marketing departments did not find it sellable. Gruenenfelder felt this was because some publishers think women in their 40s do not buy books.  Dineen said such limitations from the industry sometimes force romantic comedy authors to only think inside the box, within the genre; books about young women are often more of the money makers, but Gruenenfelder lets her characters age. Gruenenfelder wanted to escape the restrictions of writing formulaically within publishing norms, Dineen said, even if top publishing companies might not be willing to put their money behind it.   Despite being turned away by publishers, Gruenenfelder said she still felt compelled to write the novel.  &#8220;I chose to do those stories for (&#8216;Hangovers &amp; Hot Flashes&#8217;) because I have friends in their 40s who don&#8217;t feel like anybody&#8217;s writing for them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When you&#8217;re not quite sure what your personal life is, in my mind, is a very universal story for middle-aged women &#8211; I know a lot of people going through some version of that.&#8221;  ",['cap-anushka-jain'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ae_.hangoversandhotflashes.CQ_.jpg

UCLA football had its first of 15 spring practices Tuesday morning at the Wasserman Football Center. Ninety-nine Bruins will join the team for spring camps this year, with seven early enrollees listed on the roster as well.  ""Were all just happy to be back, said rising redshirt senior running back Demetric Felton.  With Joshua Kelley gone and preparing for the 2020 NFL Draft, Felton said his preparation for potentially becoming an every-down back has already begun.  Felton is the only running back in camp with more than 55 career rushing attempts to his name, with Duke transfer Brittain Brown not set to join UCLA until the summer. The returning Bruin running backs combined for 489 yards on 4.3 yards per carry last season.  ""Im ready to do whatever the team needs,"" Felton said. ""If its being the every-down back and taking handoffs, Ill do that. We definitely got guys in the room who are very talented as well, so were all ready.  Less than 24 hours before Felton and the rest of the running backs got back on the field, coach Chip Kelly added a new name to the fray.  UCLA hired Johnny Nansen as its new defensive line coach Monday afternoon, filling a position left vacant by now-Boston College defensive line coach Vincent Oghobaase. Nansen has been a part of six programs over the last 20 years, with his most recent job being USC's inside linebackers coach and defensive run game coordinator.  Nansen had also previously been the running backs coach at USC, Washington and Montana State.  With Nansen now tasked with bringing all his focus to the defensive line in Westwood, rising redshirt senior defensive end Osa Odighizuwa said he has already noticed a change in culture.  ""He brings juice to the D-line, just adds to the vibe,"" Odighizuwa said. ""He might have been an 'SC guy, but hes over here, 'Fours Up,' and were working.""  One player who won't be rejoining Odighizuwa in Nansen's new unit will be rising junior Atonio Mafi.  Mafi  who played defensive tackle in each of his first two seasons with UCLA  warmed up with the offensive linemen Tuesday. Odighizuwa said that while Mafi's departure will certainly change the defensive line's dynamic, he is looking forward to seeing what his teammate can do on the other side of the ball.  ""Thats where the need was, so hes just a team guy, he was willing to do it,"" Odighizuwa said. ""Im excited for him, so Im excited to see what he does on the offensive line.""  Mafi isn't the only Bruin to make the transition from interior defensive lineman to interior offensive lineman in recent years, as Boss Tagaloa made the change to center midway through his junior season in Westwood in 2018. Tagaloa was named to the preseason watchlist for the Rimington Trophy, awarded to the nation's best center, in July and was part of the unit that paved the way for back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons for Kelley.  But with both Kelley and Tagaloa now gone, the Bruins will take the next six weeks of practice to see if Felton and Mafi can fill the voids.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['football', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.football.nbk_.AL_.jpg

No. 6 UCLA baseball (12-2) lost to No. 22 TCU (11-3) on Saturday by a score of 8-4 at Jackie Robinson Stadium in its second game of the Southern California College Baseball Classic. The Horned Frogs scored three times before the Bruins got their first at-bats, and held on to their first-inning lead for the entire game.  We haven't had a game like that this year, for the most part, other than you can say Santa Barbara, a little bit, said coach John Savage. But its going to happen. When you run out there enough, its going to happen.  Five of the first six TCU hitters reached base safely against UCLAs starter, sophomore right-hander Nick Nastrini. Three of the Horned Frogs came around to score to put the Bruins in a 3-0 hole before they had even grabbed their bats.  In the top of the second inning, Nastrini struck out the leadoff hitter but then gave up a triple to outfielder Sam Thompson, who came around to score on a sacrifice fly, bringing the score to 4-0.  Nastrini managed to escape the second inning without further damage, but didn't go back out for the third  marking the shortest start by a Bruin pitcher this season.  We didn't like what we saw from (Nastrini), Savage said. Its been a rough road for him. Hes had some really good sequences throughout the season, but he wasn't throwing strikes with really any pitch. Our inability to make pitches and their ability to square up the ball was just a recipe for runs.  While the Horned Frogs scored in each of the first two innings, the Bruins bats were shut out until the bottom of the fourth.  In his second plate appearance, Noah Cardenas came up with runners on the corners but with two out already in the inning. On a 1-2 count, the sophomore catcher hit a line drive to center field, scoring the runner from third to put UCLA on the board.  The next Bruin to step up to the plate was center fielder Garrett Mitchell. The junior from Orange County hit a 1-1 offering high off the wall in right-center field for a two-run triple  the Bruins first triple of the season  and UCLA pulled within a run of TCU.  Despite being second on the team in batting average and on-base plus slugging, Mitchell said hes still working out the kinks early in the season.  I feel like Im still trying to figure it out at the plate, Mitchell said. (Like assistant) coach (Rex) Peters likes to say, Im kind of in spring training mode, where Im not all the way up into myself yet but Im getting there  little by little.  But as the Bruins drew closer on the scoreboard, the Horned Frogs came right back, putting up four runs in the top of the fifth inning on a pair of two-run home runs off the bats of first baseman Gene Wood and third baseman Conner Shepherd, extending the Horned Frogs lead to five.  I was just disappointed in how we responded, Savage said. We kind of get back in the game, its 4-3, but then (freshman right-hander Jared) Karros and (sophomore left-hander Daniel) Colwell go out there and give up four without getting an out, so that was the ballgame. The bullpen was poor.  Coming into the matchup against TCU, UCLA's relievers had thrown over 45 innings and recorded a 1.14 ERA.  The Bruins scored another run in the bottom of the fifth on a double play, but the tally would be their last run of the game.  Sophomore shortstop Matt McLain  UCLA's hits, home runs and RBIs leader  played in his first game in a week, as he was recovering from an illness that kept him out of the lineup against UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday and Vanderbilt on Friday.  Earlier this week, I had a few of the worst days of my life  I didn't move, McLain said. I got the chance to run around in (batting practice last night) and got a workout in, so I was ready to go today.  In his return, McLain singled twice, drew a walk and scored a run.  I was impressed (with McLain), Savage said. Hes really been in bed Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and most of Thursday. Its good to have him back and solidify (the shortstop) position.  UCLA has lost two out of its last three games and will look to finish the weekend on a winning note as it travels across town Sunday to face USC.

Biden spoke to a crowd of about 200 supporters at Baldwin Hills Recreation Center, as results from California and 13 other states, as well as American Samoa, poured in.  Its a good night, Biden said. And it seems to be getting even better. They dont call it Super Tuesday for nothing.  The former vice president claimed victory in nine states: Alabama, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Minnesota, Virginia, Massachusetts and Texas, but lost California to Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to The Associated Press. According to The New York Times, Biden also appeared to be winning Maine.  Sanders won Colorado, Vermont and Utah on Tuesday in what appears to have become a race largely between Biden and Sanders. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was once considered a top candidate early in the race, lost to Sanders and Biden in her home state of Massachusetts.  Biden is the third Democratic candidate to make a stop in Los Angeles leading up to Super Tuesday, following both Sanders and Warren. California holds 495 delegates, around a quarter of the delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.  Biden attributed some of his wins on Super Tuesday to former Democratic presidential candidates who endorsed him after ending their campaigns.  We won Minnesota because of Amy Klobuchar, Biden said. And we're doing well in Texas because of Beto O'Rourke. And that's why I felt proud, so incredibly proud that Mayor Pete (Buttigieg) has endorsed me as well.  Biden assured supporters that, as president, he would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, make community college free and reduce the cost of college and student debt.  Biden added that the U.S. needs a president who can heal the divide in the country and beat President Donald Trump.  We are better than this president, Biden said. So get back up and take back this country. Theres not a single thing we cant do.  Marc Honaker, a former member of Buttigiegs campaign who attended the event, said to the Daily Bruin that Buttigiegs endorsement of Biden meant a lot to him. He added that he sided with Biden because he doesnt think Sanders is electable.  I believe (Sanders) hearts in the right place, but he will be labeled as a socialist and communist, Honaker said.  Kurt Klaus, a third-year American literature and cognitive science student at UCLA, said he was supposed to attend a club meeting, but decided to go to the rally after hearing about it that afternoon.  I was like, 'You know what, I'm going to go to this Joe Biden rally because I can always go to a club meeting but I just wanted to go to a rally because I thought it'd be cool to be around people who would support a cause and to see someone who's running for president,' Klaus said.  Scott Klaus, a third-year economics and German language and culture student at UCLA, attended with his twin brother. He said he voted for Klobuchar before she dropped out Monday.  I like what (Sanders) has to say, but in terms of what I think America needs right now, Joe Biden may be a good (candidate) immediately, Scott Klaus said.  Kurt Klaus also said he likes Sanders policies and would be fine if he was in office, but added that he is unsure whether Sanders can beat Trump.  I think Biden could probably get the swing state vote better and in terms of having a safer bet for someone to beat Trump, which is my main concern. I think Biden has a better chance than (Sanders), Kurt Klaus said.  He added that he thinks Biden might be able to compromise on important issues.  I think for this point in our country, like with everything being so divided, I mean, I'm not going to say Biden can bring everyone together or anything like that, but I think we need to start moving towards a lot more compromise, Kurt Klaus said.","['cap-julia-shapero', 'cap-jhan']","['los-angeles', 'national', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ns_.bidenrally.JHan_.jpg

After releasing its sophomore album earlier this year, the sibling-trio band finished ""The Lonely Generation Tour""   in its hometown of Los Angeles at The Fonda Theatre on Thursday night. The band filled the intimate venue with high energy and emotion as it weaved together songs new and old, acoustic and electropop, to engage the crowd.  The night opened with a slow start with first opener Jayden Bartels, who sang to ukulele acoustics backed by guitar in a relatively uneventful performance. Bartels set, however, was far from representative of the rest of the show. The audiences liveliness increased dramatically once the second opener of the night, Weathers, took the stage. Not needing any introduction, the band immediately sent reverbing vibrations through the floor, effectively hyping up the crowd for Echosmith's entrance.    The upbeat energy continued as the lights came back on and each member of Echosmith took the floor. Once bassist and vocalist Noah Sierota appeared to the tune of a guitar riff and lead singer Sydney Sierota strolled in, the band threw out clear balls of confetti to be tossed into the crowd. Sydney jumped immediately into Love You Better as she effortlessly popped the balls of confetti and streamers surrounded both her and the crowd.  The band banked on its opener's high spirits for the first few songs, including Lost Somebody  another lively song featuring tambourines and clapping. Coming down from the song's vivacity, Sydney took a break to greet the audience. Despite opening with Echosmith's fast-paced songs, the beginning of the set conveyed an imperfect and incomplete snapshot of the best of the band's talent. Although the stage was brimming with excitement and bright, changing lights, the sets continuous booming background instrumentals drowned out many of Sydney and Noahs vocals.   [Related:    Q&amp;A: Echosmith bassist Noah Sierota shares journey to bands 2nd album   ]     The loud backgrounds didn't last long, however.   It was a welcome and appropriate shift when the band decided to switch gears to play its acoustic-leaning songs. Sydney called for flashlights and lighters to illuminate the crowd alongside the lavender backdrop of the stage while she sang one of the band's biggest hits, Bright. The track provided the perfect transition into the next set of songs, all expressing the bands vulnerability to its fans.  Sydney prefaced the subsequent songs by mentioning the pressure of the music industry to constantly produce music, no matter its quality. For ""Everyone Cries,"" she and Noah conveyed the family's strong emotional connection to the audience through the song in a duet backed by their dad on the piano.  Further establishing an attitude of openness with the audience, Sydney followed the familial moment with a mashup of similarly sentimental songs Follow You and Tell Her You Love Her. As she donned an acoustic guitar, blue lights appropriately refocused the spotlight on just her until the end of the song, when the band gradually reincorporated the drums, guitar and bass. It was perhaps the best part of Echosmith's performance, and the bands forte: stripping down its instrumentals to connect with fans on a deeper level through raw emotion.  Sydney then danced off, carrying a blue umbrella, to the fast drumbeat and guitar solos of Talking Dreams"" and used the built-up excitement to formally introduce each band member to the crowd.   It was a period of pure joy expressed by the band as each member performed their respective introductory solos, with a highlight being Noah showcasing a dance move he used to frequently do in elementary school.     [Related:    Concert review: Crowd energy carries Kim Petras performance in multisectional show   ]     As Echosmith drifted into ""Stuck,"" each member took a corner of the stage to play their own drum sequence. Continuing its consistent drumming with an addition of moving background lights, Echosmith chose Lonely Generation as its second-to-last song of the night. The lyrics' commentary on modern society stood out from previous ones focused more on personal topics, even though the song was similar in sound to others it performed earlier.  The show ended on a similar note, with the band's most popular song Cool Kids, dedicated to all the outcasts. The confetti balls made an appearance once again as the opening acts returned to the stage, marking the end to the night and the tour overall.  After promising to perform more shows soon, Sydney hit fans with one final message: to know that they are loved. The message, emblematic of the overall show, captured the bands ultimate intentions and hopes. Albeit not always perfectly executed, the show clearly reflected that what matters at the end of the day is unity through music.",['cap-jessica-li'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/8.AD_.jpg

No. 2 UCLA womens water polo (19-2, 2-0 MPSF) will face No. 5 UC Irvine (15-5, 1-0 Big West) on Friday at Irvine before returning home to face No. 6 Arizona State (12-5, 1-1 MPSF) on Saturday. This will be the first meeting between UCLA and UCI this season and the second time the Bruins meet the Sun Devils.  Coach Adam Wright said defense was the key focus of last weekends games against No. 9 California (11-7, 0-2) and No. 22 Pacific (3-13, 1-1 GCC) and continues to be for this weeks preparation after a defensive mishap against Pacific. Five of Pacific's eight goals were scored in the last quarter.  We just got a little bit passive, lackadaisical on our defensive side and that can't happen, Wright said. Overall, last weekend from the defensive perspective, it was a really good effort, but we dont want to allow eight goals like we did with Pacific.  Last time the Bruins played the Sun Devils, they conceded eight goals but still left the match victorious. As of UCLA's most recent match against Pacific, its average goals conceded is 5.9 per game.  Wright said the Bruins' inexperience at the time of that match contributed to their opponents' offensive success.  Weve grown as a group since then, Wright said. That was earlier on in the year  we had a lot of new people trying a lot of different combinations.  Arizona State saw three players score two goals each in the last time it faced UCLA  a more evenly distributed offense, similar to that of the Bruins.  ""We really emphasize on the team that it is not about one individual's accomplishments or impact on the game,"" said freshman utility Abbi Hill. ""It's a team effort. Even if Im not having a great game, I know I have other people on my team to pick up the slack.""  Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Georgia Phillips said her team learned valuable lessons from the earlier matches.  We learned to really be present ... starting out fiery and not holding back the entire game, Phillips said. We learned a lot about how we can work together.  Hill said working together to score goals requires key defensive plays to open up scoring opportunities. The Bruins have scored 10 or more goals in 16 of their 21 games thus far, and Hill said a strong defensive presence has allowed UCLA to stay in games when its shots are not hitting their target.  We have been focusing a lot on defense and changing (it) from the last time we played (Arizona State), Hill said. We can never just rely on our offense. We have to stop them with defense and try to put ourselves in a good position.  Friday's match against UCI at Irvine will start at 6 p.m. The Bruins will then play the Sun Devils at 11 a.m. on Saturday. UCLA was previously scheduled to face No. 15 Indiana (13-5) after Arizona State, but the match has been canceled.

The new N  etflix limited series, premiering Friday, follows Elliot Udo (Andr Holland) as a former superstar musician at the end of his rope who now owns a Parisian nightclub called The Eddy. But when tragedy strikes, Elliot finds himself trapped in a situation that could doom his club  or, worse, land him in jail. What follows is an eight-episode triumph centered around the difficulties of loss and holding a disintegrating dream together.  The series' excellence in storytelling and filmmaking comes as no surprise, as   ""The Eddy"" marks the television directing debut of Chazelle  the Academy Award-winning director of ""La La Land"" and ""Whiplash."" Jack Thorne, who is best known for writing the stage play of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, also created the show and sports writing credits for each episode. However, the true magic of the Netflix series stems from the jazz musicians, who must employ some sort of sorcery to play so masterfully.  Of course, as with most projects Chazelle is   a part of, music takes center stage in the show. Each episode showcases multiple up-tempo jazz scenes that boast a supremely talented band, contrasting   well with the quieter, more emotional scenes.   [Related:    TV review: Hollywood offers a hopeful story but is too fantastical to be realistic drama   ]   But these onstage scenes don't just sound beautiful  they look beautiful as well. While most episodes are helmed by different directors, they all contain masterfully filmed scenes full of close-up shots on the hands and faces of the musicians. The band members faces convey feelings ranging from intense pain and concentration to jubilant exhilaration and lecherous yearning, all of which is captured by not only the camera but the actors as well.  Such potent onstage emotions are also often   reflected in the characters personalities. While the show easily could have fallen into a trap of focusing only on one or two characters, The Eddy remembers to flesh out its secondary characters. This thoroughness elevates the emotional stakes of each scene and makes for a more engaging story.    The narrative consistently follows Elliot, but almost every episode is named after a different character in the band and the camera spends a significant amount of time following the titular character. The characters are given intricate  and far more realistic  background stories, making them feel more genuine. The well-distributed screen time gives more members of the ensemble cast space to shine in a way few shows have adequately done in the past. The band's bass player, Jude (Damian Nueva), easily could have been relegated to a background role but instead the show provides ample room for him to develop - his eponymous episode is one of the most emotional in the series.  Joanna Kulig, an actress best known for her role in the Polish film ""Cold War,"" definitely benefits with her added screen time as she balances her character Maja's love for Elliot with a desperate desire to achieve more. Maja isnt alone in her desperation either  every character in the show pushes this as the central theme of The Eddy. Even Elliot proves early on that he will do almost anything to keep the club afloat because everything he has is tied into it. Although from the look of the club, it's clear Elliot doesn't have much.   [Related:    Killing Eve season 3 recap  episode 4: Still Got It   ]   The visual presentation of The Eddy pushes the same end of the line desperation that characters like Elliot and Jude are experiencing. The limited series makes excellent use of the handheld camera, getting up close and personal with its characters as well as the seedy club setting. The low production value appearance initially distracts from the show itself, but the style ultimately works in context as it reflects the dive bar's industrial nature. Effortless camera movements and sun-bright lighting would seem out of place against the otherwise dingy background.  Despite such world-building, however, the largest indictment of the show is its tendency to revert to cliches. This is most evident in the fifth episode, wherein Elliot rushes to the airport to chase down his love interest Maja before she hops on a plane, embarking on a European tour to leave him forever at the Eddy. And to no one's surprise, Elliot miraculously arrives at the right gate just before she can board the plane, delivering an impassioned   speech that ultimately convinces her to stay.  Moments like these are unrealistic and detract from the overall show at times, but thankfully they appear sparingly enough so as not to completely ruin the finished product. For the most part, ""The Eddy"" grounds itself in meaningful, real-world problems, tackling drug addiction and death with care and nuance. And it doesn't hurt that there's ample talent on and off screen, guiding the show toward riveting visuals and plot lines.    If nothing else, The Eddy continues to prove a seemingly unquestionable fact  when Chazelle is involved, expect nothing less than the best.",['cap-mark-mcgreal'],"['arts-entertainment', 'ae-columns', 'film-tv']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/eddy.courtesy.jpg

It follows a Mexican American family trying to cope in the wake of a tragedy, with a bilingual script filled with Spanish slang, he said.  &#8220;I was reading 'Lydia,'   and there were a lot of things that struck me, because I lived through this life, and I&#8217;m living this life that the family deals with,"" Vallejo said. ""I was angry at the play, and at the same time, there were moments where I loved it, and other times where I didn&#8217;t know why one scene was in there.""   [Related:    Rob Clare will highlight women&#8217;s woes in his version of &#8216;Troilus and Cressida&#8217;   ]   For Vallejo, the production will be the first time he directs a play honoring his own Chicano heritage and background. ""Lydia"" has allowed him to connect to his East Los Angeles roots as well as the slang and style of language where he grew up.   For instance, he has been able to draw on his own experiences attending quinceaneras and using phrases like   ""ese,"" a term connoting friendship, and ""simon carnal,"" which roughly translates to ""of course, my friend,"" in English.  Originally written by Octavio Solis, Vallejo said ""Lydia"" highlights both the defining aspects of the Mexican American and universal human experience through its tight-knit seven-member cast and elements of magical realism.  ""Lydia"" begins with a scene featuring one of the main characters, Ceci, who has been left quadriplegic after a car accident. Although she is physically disabled, magical realism allows her to spring up at moments and deliver monologues expressing how she feels about what's happening around her, said first-year theater student Julia Prudencio, who plays Ceci.   ""Just having to voice the inner thoughts of somebody who&#8217;s experienced horrible trauma and is now stuck inside her body was liberating,"" Prudencio said. ""Just because she can&#8217;t verbalize it doesn&#8217;t mean that she can&#8217;t comprehend the tragedy of what her family is going through.""  To further highlight the actors' performances, Vallejo said part of his vision was to stray away from extravagant set design and lighting and instead use more modest background colors and decorations. By making the set background a monotone gray or white, he aimed to strip away distractions and accentuate the characters' vulnerability. Ceci is brain dead, and the four walls suspended in the air and white chairs take the audience into her mind during her monologues, Vallejo said.  [caption caption=""The script of &#8220;Lydia&#8221; is bilingual and filled with Spanish slang. Director and graduate theater student Mark Anthony Vallejo said he drew off his own experiences and uses words like &#8220;ese&#8221; as a term of friendship. (Esther Li/Daily Bruin)"" align=""aligncenter"" id=""attachment_375997"" width=""1024""]   [/caption]   The simplicity in set design allows for costumes to stand out, and   it also intentionally contrasts with the costumes, said graduate student and costume designer Saloni Mahajan. Mahajan said she worked with Vallejo to combine the set and costume design together, using block colors in the characters' clothing to either match or stand out against the background.   As an international student, Mahajan said she saw ""Lydia"" as an opportunity to learn about other cultures.  ""As a costume designer, I want to work on different cultures because I understand the value of (culture) and how emotionally people are connected with it,"" Mahajan said. ""I really want to understand how the character feels and how the actor feels, and it was obviously a huge help that the actors are from this specific culture and they understand the language.""  Mahajan decided to infuse classic '70s-era clothes with deliberate color choices depending on the character.  As the titular character enters the scene,   she said the marked color of Lydia's clothes contrasts with the grey and monotone colors of the rest of the cast; the shade represents the livelihood she exudes that other characters do not. However, as the play goes on, Mahajan said the clothing colors shift, corresponding to characters giving away or absorbing life throughout the production.    [Related:    Outdoor Shakespeare readings bring the Bard to a more social, casual environment   ]   Lydia's entrance into the play in particular signals a change in how the characters interact with each other, said third-year theater student Camila Rozo. As an immigrant from Colombia herself, Rozo said she related to Lydia's own immigrant Latina background. Nevertheless, she said she feels so different from Lydia that she has had to fight to get a grip on the character, from immersing herself in what life was like in 1970s Jalisco, Mexico, to drawing from her own heart to express Lydia's gratefulness as a character.  ""Even though politically and socially we are held in a very similar way, when it comes to the very nitty-gritty details of her stories to her relationship with her family and working, that involves a very big change (from who I am),"" Rozo said.  The play also allowed Prudencio to reengage  to reengage with her Spanish heritage and culture, as well as better relate to those who have  disabilities and have dealt with immigration issues, she said. As for  what the audience can expect, Vallejo said he wants to provide not only  an understanding of topics such as homosexuality and immigration, but  also an unforgettable experience about pushing the boundaries of love.  ""I&#8217;m trying to push the limits of theater and challenge the traditions of theater,"" Vallejo said.   ""There are a lot of elements where you would expect in a commercialized Western theater, but I don&#8217;t want to be typical,"" Vallejo said.

For now, let's call it ""mixed feelings.""   This year&#8217;s February was an eventful one, beginning with the surprise underperformance of ""Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)"" before swinging around to a stuffed Valentine&#8217;s Day weekend. That in itself is something worth noting &#8211; this is the first time since 2014 that Valentine's Day fell on a Friday.  Normally, this would just be a simple horological curiosity, but when it comes to the box office, dates &#8211; especially holidays &#8211; are actually very important for understanding why a movie performs the way it does.  For example, movies released in summer tend to have more weekday business than those released in spring or fall because more kids are out of school and able to go to the theaters. On the flip side, movies tend to do worse in months like January and August, because kids and college students are going back to school and they still have to compete with the blockbusters released over winter and summer vacations.   Holidays are similarly important. For example, why did ""Doctor Sleep,"" a critically acclaimed sequel to a classic horror film, flop last year? Part of it may be because it was released after Halloween; a weekend before and the movie might've been able to capitalize on the spooky season.  So what about this year's Valentine's Day?  First up, let&#8217;s take a look at the opening weekends. This year's Valentine's Day weekend saw four wide releases, in order of opening weekend grosses: Paramount Pictures&#8217; &#8220;Sonic the Hedgehog,&#8221; Sony Pictures Releasing&#8217;s &#8220;Fantasy Island,&#8221; Universal Pictures' &#8220;The Photograph&#8221; and Searchlight Pictures' &#8220;Downhill.&#8221;   While there's probably something to be said about the other releases &#8211; ""Sonic the Hedgehog's"" massive success or ""Downhill"" going, well, downhill &#8211; the more interesting stories come from the weekend&#8217;s two middling performers, &#8220;The Photograph&#8221; and &#8220;Fantasy Island.&#8221;  Both at least made sense for the Valentine&#8217;s Day weekend: One was an out-and-out romantic drama that captured younger audiences while the other was a PG-13 horror movie, which usually does well with young couples.  Overall, neither did atrociously, at least in the opening weekend; both earned around $13 million and $14 million, respectively.   You'd think that they'd both have unremarkable runs, with &#8220;The Photograph&#8221; as the long-term winner. That movie boasted a decent audience rating of B+ according to polling service  CinemaScore , whereas &#8220;Fantasy Island&#8221; was a poorly reviewed horror film with tepid word-of-mouth.  In a typical situation, this would mean that ""The Photograph"" would have better ""legs,"" or ticket sales after the opening weekend, than ""Fantasy Island."" After all, if a movie is well-received by audiences, then it stands to reason that they'd tell their friends about it and encourage them to go see it long after the movie's release date.  But then, a funny thing happened. Usually, box office watchers use the ""second-weekend drop"" &#8211; how much less business a movie did on its second weekend compared to its first &#8211; as a bellwether for a movie's legs.  &#8220;Fantasy Island&#8221; dropped 65% on its second weekend, which is relatively average   for its genre. &#8220;The Photograph,&#8221; however, suffered a rout; it dropped nearly 77% from its opening,  the 25th biggest drop ever recorded  to date.   Why would this occur when audiences gave it a decent B+ rating? Well, the answer may lie in the date.  After all, &#8220;The Photograph&#8221; was a romantic drama opening on Valentine&#8217;s Day on Friday, so it stands to reason that most of its business is going to be driven by Valentine&#8217;s Day. As such, it might be less a matter of audiences hating the film and telling their friends to stay away and more a matter of people rushing out to see the movie on Valentine's Day weekend.   Taking a look back at 2014 is also constructive: Two romance movies, ""Endless Love"" and ""About Last Night,"" were released on Valentine's Day weekend on Friday to even better audience reviews than ""The Photograph,"" both A-. They dropped 70% and 71%, respectively.  It might seem like just a simple detail, but details like this help tell a fuller story than just, ""Audiences hated this movie and that's why they stopped showing up."" To quote the Facebook relationship status, ""It's complicated.""  Pulling back and appreciating what kinds of movies do well on what dates &#8211; and how one can take advantage of that information &#8211; may be a big help for any School of Theater, Film and Television Bruin trying to win an audience's heart.

Council meetings are open to the public and held monthly. The next meeting will be held April 1 in the Weyburn Commons Village View Room from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.   Announcements    Los Angeles City Councilmember Paul Koretz supports safe parking for students experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity and is willing to work with UCLA and the NWWNC to support the creation of those spaces, said Jasmine Shamolian, a field deputy and policy deputy for Koretz. The NWWNC called for the creation of safe parking spaces at UCLA during its  November 2019 meeting , however UCLA Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck rejected the proposal during the council&#8217;s  January meeting .    Agenda    Zuriel Espinosa, a City of LA city planning associate, presented possible amendments to the Westwood Village specific plan, a regulation and zoning framework for the Village. The amendments focused on food and parking restrictions.  The board unanimously approved a motion recommending Los Angeles City Planning remove distinctions between fast food establishments and restaurants in the  specific plan .  The board unanimously recommended the removal of all ratios, caps and quota restrictions that limit the number or type of food establishments in the Village.  The board unanimously recommended Los Angeles City Planning remove at least several specific parking requirements in the specific plan if not all could be removed. They called for the removal of parking requirements for historic buildings and area parking requirements for hotels, motion picture theaters, nightclubs and offices. They also recommended the removal of parking replacement requirements and change of use parking requirements. Instead, the council favored the application of citywide general zoning code requirements.  The board called for the removal of all parking requirements in the Village, with 12 in favor, one opposed and one abstention. Councilmember Kevin Crummy said he opposed the motion because he thinks it would be too radical to remove all parking requirements when so many people are still dependent on cars.  If any parking requirements remain, the board unanimously called for allowing businesses to lease parking spots rather than engage in covenant agreements, which can be enforced even when ownership of the property transfers. The motion also called for increasing the allowable distance businesses can designate off-site parking to a quarter-mile.  The board unanimously granted $2,446.79 to Sprouts of Promise, a nonprofit foundation connecting families to locally grown produce, to fund a composting program at the Westwood Village Farmers' Market. The program will allow residents to drop off their compost at the market where farmers can then take it back to their farms, said Aubrey Yarborough, a community development manager for Farmer Mark.  Farmer Mark, the organization that runs the market in the Village, created Sprouts of Promise to raise funds for community initiatives.  The board unanimously granted $1,618.75 to the Westwood Village Improvement Association to fund Access Day, a local event connecting people experiencing homelessness with social services, taking place later this year.   The board unanimously granted $5,000 to the Friends of Westwood Library &#8211; a nonprofit organization that raises funds for the Westwood Branch of the LA  Library &#8211; for a computer aid position. The aid helps visitors with technology-related tasks such as using office software, government websites and downloading e-books.  The board unanimously called for the removal of  parking minimums  in the North Westwood Village Specific Plan. Parking minimums are requirements for a certain number of parking spaces that depend on how many residents a developer expects to inhabit a building. Such requirements can increase the cost of new developments and in turn increase rental rates for students.   ",[],"['los-angeles', 'news', 'westwood']",

The planning and mobility committee of the Westwood Village Improvement Association met with Los Angeles City Planning staff Wednesday to discuss the extent to which some historic buildings could be altered. Such alterations could include updated interiors or facades that can attract novel businesses and more foot traffic to the Village.   Andrew Thomas, the WVIA&#8217;s executive director, said the Westwood Village Specific Plan, a 1989 zoning and regulatory framework, identified 45 buildings in the Village as historically significant. Some of these resources are already officially recognized and some are eligible for local, state and national designation, Thomas added.   The buildings housing Peet&#8217;s Coffee on Westwood Boulevard and California Pizza Kitchen on Broxton Avenue are both eligible for national historic designations. The Fox Village Theatre is already an LA Historic-Cultural Monument. Local historic designations were assigned to Stan&#8217;s Donuts on Weyburn Avenue, the UCLA Blood &amp; Platelet Center on Gayley Avenue and the Gayley Center within the Specific Plan.   Julia Duncan, a City of LA planning assistant, said property owners and the city council can cooperate in the alteration of an establishment.   Adrian Fine, director of advocacy for the Los Angeles Conservancy, said alterations are possible if specific to the establishment&#8217;s characteristics.   &#8220;A lot of people think once you&#8217;re designated, you can&#8217;t do anything with the building,&#8221; Fine said. &#8220;It&#8217;s always a case-by-case to figure out what are the (establishment&#8217;s) unique challenges.&#8221;   Johnson Heumann Research Associates, a survey research group, conducted a historical survey from 1986 to 1987, which contributed to Westwood Village&#8217;s original designations. Between 2010 and 2017, SurveyLA, a citywide historical resources survey spearheaded by LA Department of City Planning principal city planner Ken Bernstein, identified more potential sites around Westwood.  Thomas said that overlap between the two surveys was normal and did not jeopardize designations.   &#8220;SurveyLA does not override the Specific Plan, so if your property is not listed on SurveyLA but you are on the Specific Plan, it still counts,&#8221; Thomas said.   Although Westwood is home to 45 historical resources, LA City Planning has classified the Village as a planning district and not a historic district. Many of the Village&#8217;s historic buildings have already had significant renovations and alterations which prevent it from being a historic district, Thomas said.   &#8220;The Village has a unique history, remarkable architecture and a very distinctive sense of place,&#8221; Bernstein said. &#8220;We tried to capture that by calling (Westwood Village) a planning district.&#8221;   The process of historic designation depends on nominations from property owners and the city council. Fine said the incentives that come with historic designations have motivated property owners to make nominations.   &#8220;The majority of nominations that we get for Historic-Cultural monuments actually come from property owners themselves,&#8221; Fine said. &#8220;Mostly because people want to participate in the Mills Act Program, which is a major incentive program that can provide owners of historic properties significant tax reduction.&#8221;   Fine also said the LA Conservancy launched a study to allay some owners' fears of depreciation, specifically of properties designated as historic sites.   &#8220;I think there&#8217;s often a belief that historic designations &#8212; because it leads to additional review &#8212; may devalue a property,&#8221; Fine added. &#8220;The evidence locally and nationally certainly is just the opposite, and historic designation typically adds value.&#8221;   Owners receive a reduction in property tax as long as they maintain the historic site, according to the Mills Act Program. Fine said 900 properties are under the Mills Act Program in LA alone but added that some of Westwood Village&#8217;s properties are not eligible until they receive formal historic designation.   Bernstein said the renovation of the Tower Theatre's interior in Downtown LA into an Apple Store is an example of a successful alteration to a historic site.   The restoration project hopes to preserve the historic theater and attract more foot traffic to Downtown LA.   The Tower Theatre&#8217;s restoration is still ongoing, but its alterations were very substantial, which Duncan argued was not usually the case.   &#8220;Ninety-five percent of projects that come before (City Planning) aren&#8217;t proposing work that&#8217;s considered a significant alteration,&#8221; Duncan said.

UCLA will then face the winner of No. 7 seed USC (16-13, 8-10) and No. 10 seed Colorado (16-13, 5-13) in the second round Friday, with a chance to earn a spot in Saturday's semifinals and ultimately Sunday's championship. Read the Daily Bruin staffers' takes on how far the Bruins will go.          Michael Waldman    Women's basketball beat writer  Prediction:  Lose to Stanford in semifinals   UCLA will get to the semifinals of this weekend's Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas but will not advance any further.  Regardless of who the Bruins will face in the second round, UCLA should easily defeat either USC or Colorado.  The Bruins suffered their first loss of the season to the Trojans, but that defeat came without junior forward Michaela Onyenwere  UCLA's leading scorer. In the Bruins' home victory against the Trojans, they blew out their crosstown rival, and UCLA went 2-0 this season against Colorado, building as much as a 25-point lead against the Buffaloes in the first faceoff.  Where coach Cori Closes squad will run into trouble is in its second round. With No. 3 seed Stanford awaiting the winner of No. 11 seed Washington State and No. 6 seed Oregon State, the Cardinal should advance to meet UCLA, given that Stanford defeated the Beavers and the Cougars twice each on the season.  While the Bruins were able to best the Cardinal on the road in the team's lone meeting this season, it took 29 points from Onyenwere and a career-high 14 points off the bench from junior guard Chantel Horvat. Stanford shot almost 45% from the field this season but seemed to have an off night at Maples Pavilion when it only made 36.6% of its shots from the field. The Cardinal's scoring and coach Tara VanDerveers experience will be too much for UCLA.  But as mid-March looms right around the corner, the Bruins won't have to wait long for another chance at making some hardwood magic.    Dylan D'Souza    Women's basketball beat writer  Prediction:  Win the tournament        The Bruins have shown they can hang with anyone.  They beat Stanford on the road by double digits and matched Oregon in the final three quarters of its encounter despite shooting 2-of-23 from 3.  My initial reaction to the bracket was that UCLA got a tough schedule. The Bruins will face either USC  which they lost to earlier in the season, albeit without junior forward Michaela Onyenwere  or Colorado  which UCLA eked past by three points on the road on Jan. 12  in the second round.  But the Pac-12 is ridiculously stacked, featuring six ranked teams  the most top-25 teams ever to enter the tournament in a single season.  Despite Close heralding her players' shooting prowess at the start of the season, the Bruins have been the worst 3-point shooting team in the Pac-12, hitting just 28.5% of their attempts from beyond the arc.  But I refuse to believe that figure is an accurate representation of the teams shooting ability. Redshirt senior guard Japreece Dean, redshirt sophomore guard Lindsey Corsaro and Onyenwere have all inexplicably seen at least a 5% dip in their accuracy from deep compared to last season.  Closes team has not lost a game all season when it has either shot above 25% from 3 or kept its opponents under 33% from deep. UCLA has been afforded such a wide margin of error because of its conference-leading 16.6 offensive rebounds per game and 11.7 giveaways per game  the second-least in the Pac-12. By excelling in what they can control, such as minimizing careless turnovers and rebounding the ball well, the Bruins have suffered just four losses all season.  Despite Closes attempts to divert focus from the teams inefficient 3-point shooting in press conferences, marksmanship will be pivotal for the Bruins to advance far.  I am predicting that UCLA sees a regression to the mean in terms of its 3-point shooting to usher the way to its first Pac-12 tournament title since 2006.    Kristie-Valerie Hoang    Digital Managing editor    Prediction:  Win the tournament        Listen, I know youve probably  or not  read my past sports predictions. Theyre usually about UCLA football miraculously scoring a victory against a top-tier team in the hopes that my traveling efforts are worthwhile.  But things are different this time.  Ive been following UCLA womens basketball since my sophomore year. Ive sat courtside to see the team almost clinch a spot in the 2018 conference championship game before falling to Oregon in the final minute of play, and although its been nearly two years since I shot the championship tournament, I havent missed watching a single tournament game.  The Bruins lost to the Ducks twice in the semifinals of the Pac-12 tournament during my time in Westwood, and both losses were painfully close.  In 2018, Oregon closed a 13-point lead and defeated UCLA in the final minute of play. In 2019, the Bruins fell to the Ducks in overtime after trailing the Ducks for the most of the game.  UCLA wont face Oregon in the semifinals this year. In fact, the Bruins wont meet the Ducks unless they make it all the way to the finals.  Instead, UCLA will play the winner of the first-round matchup between Colorado and USC, earning a bye as the No. 2 seed. Im no sports expert, but based on past performance  the Bruins beat the Buffaloes and Trojans each by at least 10 points during conference play this year  UCLA should have the rematches in the bag.  Now for the semifinals, UCLA would face either Stanford, Washington State or Oregon State  three more teams the Bruins defeated in the regular season.  I know victories arent direct determinants of game time performance, but given this momentum, I predict UCLA will make it all the way to the finals.  And in this final matchup against Oregon, I say we win. After all, third times the charm.    Ben Brill    Graphics contributor  Prediction:  Lose to Oregon in the finals      Im a graphics contributor, not a sports writer. But I have been following UCLA this year, not only in my graphic coverage, but also as a fan.  Throughout the season, I have been belittled by some of my friends  who happen to be beat writers for womens basketball  over the graphics work I do for the Daily Bruin, as they claim all I do is color.  So I will base this prediction off of what, apparently, I know best: colors.  UCLA has a first-round bye and will then face the winner of the Colorado and USC first-round match up. The Buffaloes' sole non-grey color, CU Gold, almost resembles a cheap knockoff of classic gold and fails to complement any of Colorados three different shades of black. Its no match for USCs cardinal and gold.  The quarterfinals will be a tight battle between the Bruins' and the Trojans' classic color schemes, but given UCLAs traditional basketball success donning the blue and gold, the former will prevail. USC's color schemes resemblance to ketchup and mustard will be too much for them to overcome.  The Bruins' next matchup will most likely be Stanford, which boasts colors iconic enough to be the mascot of the university. Stanfords cardinal carries the weight of its two-color scheme, but its overall lack of diversity will be its downfall.  UCLAs final opponent, probably No. 1 seed Oregon, has a color scheme with the brazenness and diversity to end the Bruins' run. The Ducks colors feature a wide range of variations of their base green and gold, such as forest green, chartreuse and spicy mustard. In this matchup, it will be the comparative simplicity of the Bruins' scheme that will send them home.  Though UCLA has tradition on its side, Oregon has the advantage of innovation and sightliness.

No. 12 UCLA men&#8217;s volleyball (10-9, 2-3 MPSF) upset No. 6 UC San Diego (13-5, 2-1 Big West) on Saturday evening in four sets by scores of 25-16, 23-25, 25-19 and 25-21.   The last time the two teams faced off Jan. 17 in La Jolla, California, UCLA was swept and handed its first loss of the season after starting 3-0. With this match being played  in Westwood, the Bruins captured their first win against a top-10 team since Feb.1.   &#8220;It&#8217;s huge, it&#8217;s absolutely huge,"" said redshirt freshman middle blocker Daniel Matheney. ""It feels really nice that we got that win. San Diego is a really good team, and they had us the first time. The second time we came in with a better attitude. ... It just feels really good.&#8221;  Riding serves by freshman setter/opposite Mads Kyed Jensen, the Bruins raced out to a 3-0 lead that they never relinquished over the course of the first set. The team's .692 hitting percentage was its highest single-set percentage of the season.   The Bruins also recorded 12 blocks at the net, enough to tie for their second-highest mark this season.      After a second set that featured 10 ties before eventually swaying in favor of the Tritons, the Bruins used two crucial blocks to win the third set &#8211; the first of which forced set point and the second of which clinched the set win.  Coach John Speraw said Matheney's contributions at the net were important to the team's victory.  &#8220;Matheney coming in and stuffing a lot of balls was very impactful. We ended up having a really nice night at the net,&#8221; Speraw said. &#8220;We were pretty focused on what we needed to win, and you could see that in the result.&#8221;  Matheney, who recorded four blocks on the night, said the game plan at the net played a key role in the team&#8217;s success there.  &#8220;Our net play was really good today &#8211; we got a lot of blocks, actually,&#8221; Matheney said. &#8220;Big shout out to our coaches telling us about tendencies, telling us where to go &#8211; it was up to us to just execute, and we did that.&#8221;  With the Bruins needing three points to win the match, Matheney recorded a block assist, notched a kill and then hit a service ace that hit the tape and trickled over the net to win the set and match for UCLA.  &#8220;It definitely feels good,&#8221; said redshirt senior middle blocker Matt Younggren. &#8220;We&#8217;re just really trying to be relentlessly positive every play, just always onto the next. Just play each point one by one and keep it going.&#8221;  Missing from the first matchup between the teams was the Bruins' leader in kills &#8211; senior middle blocker Daenan Gyimah. In the rematch, Gyimah made his presence known by leading the game in kills while setting his season high at 16.   UCLA will return to league play Friday when it travels to take on No. 9 Pepperdine. Even with the win, Speraw said his players need to continue to improving before the postseason.  &#8220;I feel like we&#8217;ve had different phases of the season where we really got to work on this, and then we really got to on that. Even now it&#8217;s something a little different,&#8221; Speraw said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a matter of, do we have enough time, do we have enough focus with the practice time that we have left to make the changes necessary for us to win at the end?&#8221; ",[],"['mens-volleyball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.mvb_.wrap_.SG_-1.jpg

UCLA track and field finished in the top five for both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s competitions at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships over the weekend. Competing in Seattle for the fourth time this season, the Bruins saw three records fall and three event victories.   The Bruins took an early lead in the meet Friday after junior thrower Alyssa Wilson won the weight throw, earning UCLA&#8217;s first 10 points. Wilson proceeded to also win the MPSF title in shot put Saturday.  &#8220;This was the meet I actually had fun competing (in),&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;I felt like there was a lot of pressure on me in the other meets. This meet, I felt more relaxed knowing that I already qualified for NCAAs for both events, so I kind of just went out there and had fun.&#8221;  In the women's 4x400 relay, a quartet of sprinters &#8211; freshman Makenzy Pierre-Webster, freshman Catherine Leger, junior Shae Anderson and senior Meleni Rodney &#8211; crossed the finish line at 3:30.28, breaking both the UCLA indoor and Dempsey Indoor facility records for that event.   The other first-place finisher for the Bruins was junior distance runner Christina Rice, who set a program record in the 5000 meters with a time of 16:12.16, besting her previous indoor record by more than four seconds.  Other top performances on the women&#8217;s team include a third-place pentathlon finish from junior multievent athlete Isa Videler and fifth and sixth place from freshman sprinter Chinyere Okoro in the 200-meter and 60-meter races, respectively.   Overall, the women&#8217;s team finished tied for fifth place, an eight-spot improvement from last year&#8217;s 13th-place finish.  The men&#8217;s side saw a pair of second-place finishes from sophomore sprinter Kenroy Higgins II in the 60-meter dash and senior distance runner Riley Kelly in the 800-meter race. Higgins&#8217; time of 6.59 seconds not only set a personal record but also took down an all-time UCLA indoor record in the event.   &#8220;Anyone who doubted me really missed out on a lot,&#8221; Higgins said. &#8220;Any coach who really has an eye for talent would&#8217;ve seen the talent that I had from the jump &#8211; like coach (Avery) Anderson did when he brought me back into the program.""  Kelly, competing in his fourth MPSF championships, matched his best finish of second place from two years ago and earned eight points for the Bruins.  The Bruins also had top-four finishes from senior jumper Harrison Schrage in the long jump, sophomore jumper Sean Lee in the high jump, senior multievent athlete Isaiah Holmes in the heptathlon, senior pole vaulter Michael Fancey in the pole vault and sophomore thrower Jacob Wilson in the shot put.  &#8220;Overall our team did pretty well &#8211; happy that (Higgins) got the school record, happy for (Rice),&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a great group going for NCAAs, so it should be fun.&#8221;  The Bruins&#8217; next meet will be the NCAA Indoor Championships in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in two weeks.

No. 3 UCLA gymnastics (6-2, 4-2 Pac-12) will face No. 9 California (4-3, 4-3) on Sunday in Pauley Pavilion. The Bears will be the Bruins&#8217; final Pac-12 opponent before the Pac-12 championship on March 21.  UCLA is heading into the weekend coming off a win against then-No. 18 Oregon State following a previous loss to then-No. 3 Utah the week before.   &#8220;The (Oregon State) meet had a lot of energy and the team was feeling really good,&#8221; said sophomore Norah Flatley. &#8220;Obviously we don&#8217;t dwell on our losses, so we weren&#8217;t really thinking about it as a comeback. (It was) just doing what we normally do.&#8221;  Junior Kendal Poston said UCLA wants to continue its goal of going bigger in every event in the upcoming meet after scoring a 198.025 in its meet versus Utah.  &#8220;The team really set (its) goals for the rest of the season just (to) be about going big, having no regrets, really just soaring out there,"" Poston said. ""We don't want to be playing anything safe, we want to show our big gymnastics because we have it and it&#8217;s awesome when we go out and perform.&#8221;  Similar to UCLA, Cal has suffered losses to Utah and No. 12 Washington this season, but both defeated Oregon State, No. 24 Arizona and Stanford. However, the Bears fell to the Arizona State Sun Devils, whom the Bruins outscored by a margin of 1.725 points.  UCLA outranks Cal in every single event, holding the No. 5 spot or above in all four of them. The Bears' No. 6 ranking on vault is just behind the Bruins' No. 5 ranking, and Cal additionally holds a top-10 ranking in uneven bars &#8211; on balance beam, it is tied at No. 11, and it is ranked No. 15 on floor.  Individually, the Bears have no athletes in the top-10 ranking. The only event in which the Bruins do not make the top-10 individual rankings is vault. Otherwise, UCLA has two athletes holding a top-10 spot per event.  Coach Chris Waller said the team sets itself apart from this weekend's opponent and all others with the authenticity of its performances.  &#8220;We go out on the floor, and we kind of bare our souls to the world and we share our story,&#8221; Waller said. &#8220;I think the way that we touch our audience is relatable, and I think that&#8217;s why people like to watch us &#8211; that joy and effervescence with which we compete, but also just the fact that we are relatable on floor.&#8221;  This meet also marks the second-to-last home meet of the season for the Bruins, who will face Bridgeport next weekend to wrap up the regular season.  Waller said that he is proud of UCLA&#8217;s achievements throughout the season &#8211; his first as head coach.  &#8220;I&#8217;m extremely proud about where the team has come (and) the growth the team has had. So many people have stepped up in terms of leadership and we&#8217;ve hit a lot of milestones, but collectively the team is incredibly connected,"" Waller said. ""Up to this point, the story we&#8217;ve written is we&#8217;ve got a dynamic top-three team in the country, we&#8217;re contenders for a national championship, but more importantly we&#8217;ve built something really special together that I know they&#8217;re going to remember for a lifetime.&#8221;  The Bruins and the Bears will square off at 1 p.m. on Sunday.

With Stanford having five players in its rotation as tall as or taller than UCLAs tallest active player, the Bruins allowed 15 offensive rebounds that led to nine Cardinal points, and gave up 32 points in the paint.  No. 2 seed UCLA womens basketball (26-5, 14-5 Pac-12) fell to No. 3 seed Stanford (27-5, 15-4) by a score of 67-51 to bow out of the Pac-12 tournament in the semifinals for the fourth straight year at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas.  I can handle losing but it's really hard to swallow when we get out-toughed and out-executed at that level, said coach Cori Close. Hopefully some of the things that got exposed in us today will really inform our next two weeks of practices.  Cardinal guard Lexie Hull scored 13 of her 28 points in the first half, nearly matching her scoring average of 13.3 points per game in that frame alone. She also added six first-half rebounds, good for the most of any player.  The Bruins only managed to secure four defensive rebounds in the first half, with no player donning the blue and gold hauling in more than two rebounds in the half. The 11 offensive rebounds UCLA gave up to Stanford were converted to seven second-chance points.  We kept them to 25 points (in the first half) which was great, but I don't think we came out with the sense of urgency and just competitiveness and fight and focus that we had in the first half, said junior forward Michaela Onyenwere. That is something that we just have to continue to get better at even when shots aren't dropping for us.  Both teams were uncharacteristically turnover prone, combining for 25 turnovers in the opening half in comparison to their combined average of 25.3 turnovers per game prior to Saturday.  The Bruins finished the game with a season-high 21 turnovers, 12 of which came off Cardinal steals. Stanford also had 21 turnovers, but only allowed UCLA to score 14 points off them  12 fewer than Stanford scored off UCLAs giveaways.  After closing the deficit to three points early in the third quarter, Stanford went on a 23-4 run to leave UCLA with an insurmountable task in the fourth quarter.  A lot of things went wrong during that stretch (and the Cardinal) were able to get into an offensive rhythm, Close said. In the third quarter, all their passing, cutting, getting the ball where they needed to and who they needed to (came together). (They were) coming off screens and getting in rhythm shots and getting to the cup one-on-one.  UCLA managed to cut Stanfords lead  which got as large as 26 in the fourth quarter  to 13 points with 2:45 remaining, but Hull responded with back-to-back steals and scores to put the game out of reach.  The sophomore guard added to her second-best scoring performance of the season by stuffing the stat sheet with five steals, nine boards and a career-high-tying seven turnovers.  The Bruins only got scoring contributions from five players  a season low. Three of the five players that scored  Onyenwere, redshirt senior guard Japreece Dean and freshman guard Charisma Osborne  contributed 14 points each.  Everybody's game plan is going to start with (Dean), (Osborne) and (Onyenwere), Close said. It's not just other people who have to step up and make shots. It's not that simple. We've got to know what we're doing and how we're creating together so we make a higher percentage of those shots.  Apart from Osborne, who was 4-of-7 from beyond the arc, UCLA shot 13.3% from 3. The Bruins failed to score consistently, scoring on only 33.3% of their possessions in comparison to 48.4% for the Cardinal.  Stanford will play No. 1 seed Oregon on Sunday at 5 p.m. in a rematch of last years Pac-12 tournament final in which the Cardinal took home the trophy with a 64-57 win.  UCLAs fate in the NCAA tournament will be revealed March 16 at 4 p.m. on ESPN during the Selection Show.  I can pretty much guarantee you we will come out different for the first couple rounds of the NCAA tournament, Close said. We will be much tougher. We will be much more together and we will be able to execute through difficult circumstances at a higher level.",['cap-dylan-dsouza'],"['sports', 'womens-basketball']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/DSC_8217.jpg

Public comment     	 Representatives from the California Public Interest Research Group said they are working on their campaign to ban single-use plastics. Although this effort has been successful at UCLA, they are meeting with officials from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and other offices to deliver a petition signed by more than 1,000 students. They are also working on an anti-fracking campaign and a textbook affordability campaign.     Special presentations     	 Andy Cofino, the LGBT Campus Resource Center director, said the USAC Student Wellness Commission $10,000 grant has positively impacted the center. The grant went mostly toward a leadership retreat for students as well as education and training measures. The retreat had student leadership sessions, allyship training and other activities for 28 student participants and five facilitators over three days.   	 Dean of Students Maria Blandizzi answered questions from the council regarding UCLAs decision to move classes and finals to online forums. She said Chancellor Gene Blocks statement was not policy and was not mandatory, however, students could reach out to her office if, after reaching out to faculty, they are unable to meet requirements.     Agenda     	 The council discussed the implications of UCLAs decision to move classes online. President Robert Watson said he thinks students should be consulted more when making academic decisions, such as moving classes online. Academic Affairs Commissioner Naomi Riley said faculty was set to further discuss the decision at an Academic Senate meeting. The UCLA Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center will be open during spring break.   	 The Student Health Advisory Committee presented UC Student Health Insurance Plan systemwide changes it is set to vote on. The committee will vote ""no"" on an increase to the number of charges covered by UC SHIP for psychoeducation testing from 3,000 to 4,500. They will vote ""yes"" to a 0.02% increase to cover gender-conforming facial surgery. They will vote ""yes"" to expanding eligibility for domestic partner registration. People over 18 would be able to be added on as dependents as well. They will also vote ""yes"" for fertility preservation to be covered.   	 It also presented info on UCLA-specific changes for councils input, such as a proposed $5 copay for students, up from $0, for a X-rays at student health center. There is also a proposed drop of a $5 copay for live health telemedicine.   	 The council allocated a total of $21,190.33 from the Contingency Programming Fund to non-USAC groups.   	 The council allocated a total of $1,564 from Student Wellness Programming Fund to five non-USAC groups.   	 The council allocated a total of $2,050 from the Academic Affairs  Travel Grant Mini Fund.   	 The council allocated a total of $1,200 from the Academic Success Referendum fund.   	 The council allocated $51,839 from the Arts Restoring Community fund to non-USAC groups.   	 The council allocated a total of around $2,427.46 from the USA/Board of Directors Associated Students UCLA Programming Fund to 81 programs.   	 The council approved two referenda for the 2020 USAC spring election ballot. One referendum seeks to increase student fees by $9 a year, which would go toward existing USAC funds in order to be directed to student groups. Another will designate funds toward creating a black student resource center, and cultural organizations via the Associated Students UCLA Board of Directors. Funds of the latter would also pay off debt of the Transfer Student Center.   	 The council approved a bylaw change to move the Good Clothes Good People redistribution to under the Community Service Commission.   	 Council will host meetings virtually while classes are online as well.   	 The council approved an election code bylaw change allowing the election board chair to make decisions  including those that deviate from the election code  to ensure the continuity of the election, with the permission of the council. The change will be in effect until April 10.   	 External Vice President Johana Guerra Martinez said UC Student Association student leaders canceled a student lobby conference, which would cost her office $65,000. She asked the council to consider withdrawing funding from UCSA. A majority of the council voted in favor of dropping from UCSA.   	 The council motioned to release checks to the Campus Retention Committee and the Student Initiated Outreach Committee only after the committees released three years of budgetary information.     Reports     	 Internal Vice President Kimberly Bonifacio said applications for the offices partnership fund are open.   	 Guerra Martinez said the UC Regents meeting is from March 12-14. She also said the student lobby conference cancellation will cost $65,000.   	 Facilities Commissioner Lily Shaw said people can apply to The Green Initiative Fund.   	 Community Service Commissioner Jonathan Wisner said the offices leadership and service award, the Robert S. Michaels Leadership in Service Award, is open for applications.

The Tigers have now defeated the Bruins twice in a row, both times by a score of 3-2. UCLA defeated LSU 4-1 in Hawaii on Feb. 22 but subsequently lost the rematches Feb. 23 and Saturday. Coach Stein Metzger said the competition from LSU is not much of a surprise.  I knew going into the season that LSU was going to be the team to beat, Metzger said. Im looking forward to improving and gaining on them throughout the season.  UCLA began the Tiger Beach Challenge with a 5-0 win against Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi, beating the Islanders in two sets on every court except court three, with the pairing of junior Mac May and redshirt freshman Jaden Whitmarsh.  The Bruins continued their success with a 4-1 defeat of the Green Wave. All five of the matchups ended in two sets, and the court four pairing of freshman Rileigh Powers and senior Madi Yeomans was the only one that did not win.  Despite momentum from the two early wins, UCLA fell in its last match of the day, losing 3-2 to LSU. The Tigers first won the matchup on court four, as LSU's Kelli Agnew and Taryn Kloth defeated freshmen Devon Newberry and Powers before UCLA tied the match with a court five win from Yeomans and junior Megan Muret.  The Bruins dropped the next two matchups, losing on courts one and two. Junior Lea Monkhouse and senior Lily Justine won the last matchup on court three, but the outcome had already been decided.  Senior Savvy Simo said quick decision-making was something UCLA lacked against LSU.  We need to work on making better defensive and blocking decisions, especially against a team of their size and talent,"" Simo said. ""Obviously the match was very close, and I think we played really well. It is hard to play at their home court, but we battled it out, and it was a really close match.  Metzger said he was more concerned with his players' offensive performance against the Tigers.  (LSU was) beating us in the pass and serve battles, Metzger said. It's really hard to win when the other team is serving better and passing better than you are.  UCLA will begin Pac-12 play March 7, with matches against No. 19 Arizona State (2-2) and No. 4 USC (2-2). It will also play Oregon (2-2) and Washington (2-1) on March 8.  Even with early struggles, Simo said she has faith in her team's ability down the stretch.  We are a young team, Simo said. We are developing, though, and I have a lot of faith in this team.

With the win, Pettway improved to 3-0 in 25.2 innings, pitching to the tune of a 1.05 ERA this season.  &#8220;I know what I have and what I can offer to our team,&#8221; Pettway said. &#8220;I&#8217;m an aggressive (pitcher) and I go after guys, and I think when I&#8217;m doing that, it just helps out our team in general.&#8221;  The Bruins had chances to score in the early innings against the Commodores&#8217; starter Kumar Rocker, but left a pair of runners stranded in each of the first two frames.  The Bruins' breakthrough on the scoreboard came in the bottom of the third inning, when redshirt freshman first baseman JT Schwartz hit a line drive into left center, splitting Vanderbilt&#8217;s outfielders. Senior left fielder Kyle Cuellar scored from first for the game's opening run.  &#8220;I just wanted to jump on the first good (fastball) he gave me,&#8221; Schwartz said. &#8220;(Getting an early lead) is huge. Anytime we get a lead, we can count on (Pettway) and our defense and our pitching.&#8221;  And once the Bruins scored the go-ahead run, they didn't relinquish the lead for the rest of the game.  The Bruins added to the lead in the next inning, when the first three batters reached base, ending Rocker&#8217;s night. With nobody out and the bases loaded, junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell hit a sacrifice fly to left field, scoring the second run. The throw back from the outfield went past the cutoff man and past the infield, eventually landing out of play in the Bruins' dugout. The Vanderbilt error allowed sophomore shortstop Mikey Perez to score as well, giving UCLA a 3-0 lead.  In the top of the fifth inning, Vanderbilt scored its only runs of the game, coming on a one-out, two-run double by third baseman Parker Noland.  After Pettway exited, Savage went to the same three right-handed bullpen arms he&#8217;s turned to most this season &#8211; right-handers junior Michael Townsend, senior Kyle Mora and junior Holden Powell.  &#8220;Our bullpen&#8217;s been so good all season,&#8221; Savage said. &#8220;I just felt compelled to go to the bullpen.&#8221;  The trio combined to throw three scoreless innings, working out of jams in the eighth and ninth innings.  Powell entered the game with two outs and a runner on first base in the top of the eighth, but got a strikeout to end the threat.  In the top of the ninth, the Commodores made a late push, getting the tying and go-ahead runs on base. Powell &#8211; who had fallen behind in the count to each of those hitters &#8211; managed to come back with two strikeouts to close out the Bruins&#8217; 12th win.  The bullpen has now thrown 47.1 innings this season, only allowing six earned runs.  UCLA will play its second game in the Southern California College Baseball Classic on Saturday at home against No. 22 Texas Christian.

Alumna Victoria OBryan is the wine director for Addison, San Diegos only Michelin-starred restaurant. She said her passion for the restaurant business began when she entered the catering and service industry after her first year at UCLA, which eventually led her to the position of wine director in December. The intersection of different fields within wine are what she said attracted her to it, as the practice allowed her to apply several disciplines, such as geography and life sciences. She said searching for the origin stories of certain grapes through thousands of producers spanning centuries is one of the never-ending journeys of her career.  Wine really encompasses everything, OBryan said. There is not only geography and geology, but also biology, chemistry, and you have to think about meteorology and climate change.      [Related:    Wine About It: Pinot gris lives up to name as gray, dull, pond water-looking wine   ]   With a background as an English student, OBryan said being trained to constantly read taught her to focus on the meticulous details of perfecting the dinner menus every night and keeping up to date with current wine information, which is crucial for her position. She tries to easily articulate intricate ideas, such as fermentation, to customers in a way that allows them to quickly understand how it works, O'Bryan said. Her general responsibilities as wine director focus on overseeing an extensive bottle list of 3,600 bottles in Addison's selection and 12,000 in the wine cellar, she added.  Half of my job when I am with guests is just translating complex ideas into something more fascinating and intriguing, OBryan said. I paint it in a way so they can really enjoy the experience of it all to see how everything came together for that moment.  Practicing pairings allows OBryan to gain more accuracy in her work, as she said she thinks through and writes down what she is eating with her wine. There are endless combinations of wine and food, and OBryan said reading about what other curators are doing opens her eyes to possibilities she would not have previously thought of, such as glossy champagne with rich and fatty wagyu steak.  Although comfortable with pairing similar tasting food to similar tasting wines, OBryan said she prefers pairings with tastes that would not typically match. For example, she said a bright and fruity pinot noir complements something like a briny seafood dish. The opposing flavors and textures surprise her guests in a delightful way, she added.  Historically, wine pairings stemmed from the local cuisine of the regions the grapes were grown, OBryan said. The classic pairing of Barolo wine with truffle originates from Barolo, Italy, as both are abundant within and indigenous to that region. This morphing of the wine and cuisine to create local delicacies within provinces i  s repeated throughout history, O'Bryan said.  You see this time and time again with regions that have local cuisine and local wine that have been around for centuries, OBryan said. They seem to find some sort of symbiotic relationship and somehow complete each other.   [Related:    Student creates sommelier club for Bruins to cultivate love for wine   ]   Exploring the origins and modern-day impacts of these historical pairings, Professor Joseph Nagy said he helped establish the interdisciplinary food studies minor for UCLA students, as he has an interest in the process of obtaining, distributing and consuming food. He said drinks such as wine often come to symbolize crucial cultural values and social relationships.  It is not just the humanities, Nagy said. It is also social sciences, life sciences and the arts. All of these things come together in our appreciation of food both as an essential human reality and profoundly meaningful and symbolic part of our lives.  Wine doesn't have to be in a Michelin-starred restaurant to be appreciated. The Anderson Wine Clubs co-president and graduate student Emily Mitchell said the club aims to promote education, appreciation and networking revolving around wine for graduate students. She said wine specifically fosters personal and professional connections through its balance of pleasure and sophistication.  I love the connection it builds among people, Mitchell said. I love the history that you can learn about a certain region through wine. You know it's good because of the terrain.  For OBryan, she said her role extends past the wine selection, as she monitors the house staff and serves as her own copy editor for the menus. The restaurant also earned Wine Spectators Grand Award, which it has held since 2009, OBryan said. Her love for wine is what she said has solidified it as a career that is constantly expanding to keep the restaurant and wine pairings exciting and up to date.  We are constantly evolving, OBryan said. But being able to be here every day helps me not see it as pressure, but as a challenge to get a chance to really take the next step into what our next vision might be.",['cap-yasmin-madjidi'],"['arts-entertainment', 'lifestyle']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.ae_.addison.courtesy.jpg

The quarterly event put on by the UCLA Music Club will be held in Kerckhoff Grand Salon on Friday, inviting both members and nonmembers to perform. Fourth-year psychology student Arissa Santos said she uses Band Night as an outlet to destress from academics and show friends her passion. Instead of placing high expectations on the bands who are performing, she said the event's casual nature creates a comfortable atmosphere where anyone can sign up and share music they&#8217;ve been working on.  &#8220;It&#8217;s really nice that (Music Club) has something like Band Night, because it&#8217;s not as strict as other venues,"" she said. ""A lot of bands out here are out to get big (and) get signed, and sometimes that&#8217;s just not my goal. I really just want to make music.&#8221;   [Related:    UCLA Music Club bands together hobbyist and seasoned artists, creates community   ]   Last year was Santos&#8217; first year performing at the event, which she heard of through other musicians she met at sporadic jam sessions. As a guitarist and vocalist, it was easy to add people to the band, Santos said, and using other instruments like bass, piano and harmonica kept her from feeling like she was falling into a boring musical routine. After much collaboration, Band Night was the perfect opportunity to showcase her band&#8217;s experimental approaches, she said.  Before coming to UCLA, Santos said she played gigs in an all-girl rock band from time to time, but the group inevitably broke up when she came to college. She said meeting musicians with different styles through Music Club led her current band to create new covers such as their jazzy rendition of &#8220;Babe I&#8217;m Gonna Leave You&#8221; and an acoustic version of   &#8220;Mr. Brightside.&#8221;   Singing covers at her Band Night performance offers familiar songs for the audience but allows the group enough freedom to add their own creative twists, she said.  &#8220;I really just wanted my friends to come and listen to some tunes because I was spending hours in a basement and I thought what we&#8217;d been playing was pretty good,&#8221; Santos said.  Band Night also offers a space for those not formally studying music or theater to take the stage. First-year physics student Rishi Acharya said as a drummer, he didn't plan on performing in college because he thought more experienced musicians would achieve the spotlight. But he said Band Night offered him and other bands, duos and soloists an opportunity to perform their music to an intimate crowd regardless of the extent of their experience.  Before his Band Night debut, Acharya found his band during Music Club&#8217;s open jam sessions in Kerckhoff. Their main style is jazz fusion, which he said is a combination of his rock background with 1940s and 1950s jazz. The genre resonated well because Band Night is a relatively small scene, he said, so it&#8217;s comfortable for those who are just starting off because they can have their closest friends come and support their ideas.  &#8220;They don&#8217;t need to have their first performance in front of 100 people with high expectations,"" Acharya. ""For us, we want to test drive a couple of new songs because we got into composing our own music recently. So we want to show people and see how they react.&#8221;   [Related:    UCLA student&#8217;s band independently produces upcoming EP   ]   Warren Coons, a second-year applied mathematics student and co-president of Music Club, said the event is for anybody who&#8217;s mildly curious about performing in front of a live audience.   There&#8217;s no formal audition process, he said, and both the club and audience members are very supportive of the performers to make newcomers feel comfortable.  &#8220;We try to reiterate that anybody can come,"" Coons said. ""A lot of people who perform aren&#8217;t super experienced. They just want to share what they&#8217;ve written or what they want to play.""  Since the venue is intimate, the club members hope audience members will be encouraged to perform in the future, Acharya said. Most current members aren&#8217;t thinking of pursuing music as actual careers, but he said that they want to further their passions for performance. Band Night simply offers an opportunity for them to get on stage.  &#8220;We are all really chill because nobody&#8217;s career is hinging on making a breakout performance,"" Acharya said. ""So we&#8217;re just going to do experimental music, have some fun and see how it goes.&#8221; ",[],"['arts-entertainment', 'music']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/3.4.ae_.bandnight_rgb.png

Coronavirus has impacted almost every aspect of normal life  even previously menial tasks like grocery shopping now face added challenges of wearing masks, swerving out of people's way and standing in long lines. Many people are also working from home, and UCLA students have been navigating the challenges presented by an online spring quarter.  On top of figuring out this new space, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, about 45% of adult Americans have experienced negative impacts on their mental health due to the pandemic. Balancing their mental health and online courses, many students find their attention wandering. Paige Shannon, the marketing director for UCLAs Healing through Art club, said the pandemic has increased her anxiety, as it has left her feeling more isolated. Gone are the days of walking around campus to clear the second-year music history and industry students head  now, even just finding the energy to self-start her schoolwork is a challenge.   Paige Shannon:  You're at home. Your phone is right here. Everything's at your disposal. You can walk around anywhere you want. Some classes don't even make you turn your camera on, which is the most dangerous one because in those classes I will literally just zone out. But I feel like it's really hard to focus because your mind just wanders. There are other things going on. You can even be in bed. You know I think there's a distinction between there's the time you're at school and you're like, ""OK, my brain has to be on and focusing."" And then home is where you go to de-stress. But now those lines are blurred because you're always at home. And I feel like it's also really messed up my sleep schedule. And so that's made it harder to focus too, because I'm up super late and then I'll have a 9 a.m. class. I'm drinking two cups of coffee throughout the entire class just trying to stay awake. Not even focus, just stay awake and not fall asleep.   KS:  Students arent the only ones trying to cope with the pandemics impact. According to the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), first responders like health care providers are likely to have a heightened response to the stress caused by the pandemic. Medical personnel spend their days seeing the first-hand impacts of the virus, often also handling the emotional weight of conducting patients final correspondence with loved ones. Many graduating medical students will be entering the field in the coming months, facing a lack of personal protective equipment, long hours and exposure to the virus. PRIME reporter Zinnia Finn spoke with some students preparing to face these challenges. Haley Vertelney, who is going into emergency medicine at UCSF, said she had plans for this short period between graduation and her residency  vacations to Japan and Hawaii, road trips and camping excursions. Now, no longer able to celebrate this big milestone, she said the lack of structure has been detrimental to her mental health.   Haley Vertelney:  I think that the way the government has been handling this is particularly disheartening, and I think that it's really kind of clarified to me how undervalued doctors are in a lot of ways, which it's hard to feel super excited about going to work when there doesn't seem to be enough, like really basic, protective equipment to go around. You hear all these stories about ER doctors getting sick, ER doctors committing suicide and getting pay cuts, like kind of all of those things together like makes it seem not like the most fun time. So I would say that my excitement to go to work is less because there's this pandemic going on and more because this is something that I've wanted to do for a really long time. I have felt moments, like some pride in like, ""I'm going to go to this cool thing."" And I truly believe that this is a defining moment definitely in my lifetime and in my generation's lifetime, and to be able to participate so directly in it is at least interesting, if not exciting.   KS:  Stress and depression are not new issues within the medical field. Chris DeMatteo, who will be starting an emergency medicine residency at Mount Sinai in New York City, has previously studied burnout in the medical field. According to the New York Times, medical workers are often already at risk to mental health issues. People treating COVID-19 patients are likely to face anxiety, depression and insomnia on top of preexisting issues of burnout. DeMatteo said entering the workforce now comes with added anxiety related to coronavirus.   Chris DeMatteo:  My research during medical schools on burnout in the medical field. It's been a big issue for me and now we're facing burnout in an unprecedented way. I read an article just this morning about how health care workers are already experiencing PTSD from the things they've seen and the kinds of experiences they've had from this pandemic. And I think now more than ever, we're going to have to be extremely vigilant for ourselves, for our co-workers, for everyone around us about the effects on mental health that this pandemic is going to have on all of us. In much the same way that this COVID pandemic has disrupted the shape of American society, I think the burnout pandemic is going to disrupt the shape of the health care industry.   KS:  Knowing the pandemic will impact peoples mental health, there are a number of tips and free resources available. The CDC recommends creating a personalized list of enjoyable activities, turning away from the news at times and asking others for help. Students have turned to a number of different resources to cope. Shannon has found that even picking up her guitar for just 30 minutes a day can help clear her head. And she often turns to her favorite artists' live streams, live Pheobe Bridgers' Pitchfork live stream, as a distraction. HART has been hosting online events in hopes of creating a virtual community for students. Through Zoom, theyve had art meditation events and a dance session, as well as a nature walk. HART president Liz Reichner said practicing mindfulness in her daily activities has helped her find a sense of peace.   Liz Reichner:  Me and my sister created a business. We've been making sourdough bread, and we've been giving it to our neighbors. And it's so good. Sourdough bread is so good. We had to make a sourdough starter, and we've been keeping it alive. And that's really fun because you're nurturing a little baby. We've made cinnamon bread, which is really yummy. And we've also made these brown butter toffee chocolate chip cookies, which are delicious. And we've also been selling those, so we've been making extra money on it.   KS:  As a second-year art student, however, creating has been her major outlet. Even just viewing art has offered an escape for many  the Fowler Museum at UCLA now offers online exhibits after closing to the public in March, and the Getty Museum has video footage of its exhibits and a free virtual library. Even without access to formal art therapy, making art at home might be a soothing resource for people.   LR:  I think the most reflective pieces I've been doing are with charcoal because I'm usually a painter, and also I usually do portraits, but with painting and portraits, sometimes you can be too focused on, you know, the perfections or the likeness that you're trying to capture. But with charcoal, and when you're doing something that's more abstract, you're more focused on the stroke and what that stroke means to the whole painting instead of the physical likeness or what it represents. I think using charcoal on a piece of paper or even on a canvas and kind of relating that to yourself and what the whole piece means to you to emotionally has been really, really helpful. I've done multiple charcoal drawings and I've just let go so much. It's just like, ""What is the feeling?"" I feel like that's the whole basis of art therapy. It's expressing yourself through art, but how did these mediums relate to your emotions? How can you put some paint or watercolor on paper, and what does that mean to you?   KS:  But even with resources and tricks, the uncertainty and onslaught of news can be difficult to grapple with. Many face the challenge of wanting to remain informed while not becoming completely overwhelmed. Vertelney has been running on local trails, spending time with her mom and dog and speaking with her therapist. But even with these tactics, finding a balance remains tricky.   HV:  I've also been really trying to be mindful about what media I've been consuming. I think it's really easy to go down a dark hole of limited time and access to the internet. I've been careful to strike a balance between like being informed with the news, but not reading every single sensational story, because it gets exhausting. And it kind of makes me feel more powerless than I need to feel right now.   KS:  The sense of powerlessness, however, also comes with the knowledge that, as they enter the medical field, they have the skills to help in a time of need. Typical stress relievers  hitting the gym, seeing friends  won't be available to Vertelney once she does enter the field. But she said the opportunities UCSF offer will provide good experience. DeMatteo said hes been speaking with his co-residents already, and find the general support for health care workers to be a source of encouragement.   CD:  I'm excited to be a resource to lend support to health care forces that have been stretched very thin given this unprecedented strain on the health care system. And I'm excited to have the skills that I gained in medical school tested by this crazy environment. I think it's going to be a defining feature of my generation and having trained in medical school and in residency during a pandemic of this magnitude is really going to test us and hopefully will ultimately make us stronger.   KS:  UCLA students in need of crisis support can reach Counseling and Psychological Services at 310-825-0768, 24 hours a day. CAPS also offers a coronavirus anxiety workbook that contextualizes some of the emotions students may be experiencing and offers tips for working through them. Health care workers can look into the Emotional PPE Project, which offers a directory of licensed, volunteer mental health workers providing counseling at this time.

At UCLA, our community is remarkably united by similar feelings of loss, confusion and concern, but also by light, hope and the perspective that the pandemic has brought to the forefront.

[caption id=""attachment_380057"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Andrea Grigsby/Illustrations Director)[/caption]  Almost every day since quarantine began, I've seen some meme or article conflating global pandemic with marital friction.  You see,   Im not one to judge as Ive never been married, nor have I ever lived with another man other than my imaginary friend growing up  who spent most of his time under the table  and my father, who, thankfully, did not.  But I   guess Im just confused. Because, from where Im sitting, 106 miles away from my boyfriend of over a year, it seems unfathomable to me that more time spent in the company of ones beloved equates to less satisfaction with them.  It isnt that long distance is all bad  my boyfriend and I have basically become experts at it. But if by some crazy turn of scientific events, interaction became safe only under tables like my childhood imaginary friend ,  Id definitely choose that option over no interaction at all. Taking it even further, if the only safe way to interact was to meet under tables buried in snow in the middle of the Arctic, Id be okay with it, because I'd still get to see him.  Like I said, long distance isnt bad at all.  If only a table were the only obstacle in the way of my relationship  there's the miles of distance, the germs and vulnerable immune systems, and the Los Angeles governmental stay-at-home order, which may be in effect until  July , and who really knows how much longer.  The saying   that ""Home is where the heart is"" doesn't seem to ring true for me because Im at home physically, but Im not here mentally. And the mental connection to where I really am is being thinly held together by an overwhelmed WiFi router and drained, weary   eyes from too much screen time.  For the past month, my relationship with my boyfriend   has been grounded in memories of togetherness, snail mail, an abundance of text messages and the expectancy of an unconfined future. The issue at hand   is that the end is uncertain for   everyone, and attempts at predicting an ending only results   in bouts of frustration.  It isnt the first time our relationship has gone remote. In the past, there have been thousands of miles between us while one of us has traveled and the other has waited. But the thing that made those times manageable isnt in this current equation: an end date.  The last time we went almost two months apart, I counted down the days  the hours even. Ironically, the spread of the coronavirus was actually what ended that period of long distance prematurely. I was so happy, admittedly for purely selfish reasons. But five   days later, I terminated my housing contract and moved back home, once again finding myself too far from his company.  Thats when it became clear this pandemic lets nothing go unnoticed.  Now I try not to think about time.  Attempts at quantifying time apart only seem to devalue our time together. Has it been two days or two months? Its better that   I dont know. So I tell myself it must have been yesterday when we went on that hike in Malibu. And it was just a week ago when we saw that movie about the servants at that weird dinner party   that put us to sleep. And tomorrow were going to try that new Thai restaurant that opened.  What I dont know wont hurt me.  Call me naive or warped, but this is the way I prevent myself from getting swept up by the ravages of time, even if the picture of what we would have eaten from that restaurant we havent been to yet is already in my camera roll. Its all relative, you know. I just wont look at it until our dinner has passed.  The thing is, its a lot easier to account for the time that has already passed than for the time that has yet to come. I know I can always watch the progression of his growing beard through FaceTime and vicariously eat the things hed normally cook for me, but other than that, it's up to my imagination to fill the rest of the void.  Truthfully, its pretty tiring pretending my food tastes as good as it does when I eat it with him or that my stomach hurts from laughing and not from missing him. But Ill continue to do it to remind myself to be thankful for how good things are when were together.  Im lucky to have that to hold onto in the meantime. That, and the most mundane of details that nobody but two people in love would find interesting. He put olives in his guacamole yesterday. I didnt wear socks today for the first time in a week. Riveting.  So dont ask me when Ill see him next or how things are going in my relationship. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused pain and trouble for the entire world  but it ultimately has no say in the affairs of my heart.

For now.  UCLA men's basketball (19-11, 12-5 Pac-12) has won seven games in a row and has emerged victorious in 11 of its last 13. In the midst of their hot streak, the Bruins have gone from a projected No. 8 seed in the National Invitation Tournament to a No. 12 seed in the NCAA tournament.  Prior to its most recent wins over Arizona State and Arizona, UCLA was in ESPN's Joe Lunardi's First Four Out. However, coach Mick Cronin said he hasn't talked with his team about their status as they've inched closer to March Madness.  ""I never talk about it with the team; were in a one-game tournament and they knew it  we all know it,"" Cronin said. ""If you guys can figure out all the metrics and the stuff they spew, I cant. So it would be a complete waste of my time.""  Heading into its matchup with California on Jan. 19, UCLA was the No. 151 team in the NET rankings. The Bruins have since jumped all the way up to No. 75  still only good for ninth among Pac-12 teams  but are No. 27 in both the AP and Coaches Polls.  Arizona remained at No. 10 in this week's update of the NET rankings despite losing to both UCLA and USC over the weekend. While Cronin avoided outright criticizing the second-year national rankings method, he said every tournament tool is arbitrary at some level.  ""When they put it out, I never read what it entailed, and so I think youve got to coach basketball and teach basketball to win games, or its just not going to matter,"" Cronin said. ""So I dont even know what goes into it to where I could criticize it, but I hear the same things everybody else hears. ... Those committee jobs  I'll tell you my experience with it  theres so many metrics, if you want to put a team in, you cite that metric. If you want to put them out, you cite that metric.""  Freshman guard/forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. said the Bruins' winning streak has fueled them over the past few weeks and that he doesn't plan on letting it get cut short before next week's Pac-12 tournament.  ""We're all competitors, we want to play basketball; it's a competitive game and we want to win games,"" Jaquez said. ""This feeling is great, and we don't want it to end anytime soon.""  Jaquez hit the game-winning 3-pointer against Arizona State on Feb. 27, but he isn't the only one getting more attention around campus.  Sophomore guard Jules Bernard had a block that led to a 3-pointer that gave UCLA a first-half lead against Arizona on Saturday, and he said several students on campus and in his French 3: ""Elementary French"" class have come up to congratulate him.  ""I think it gives us a little more motivation because we want to continue to prove ourselves,"" Bernard said. ""We've had a great streak, and we want to continue that streak.""  UCLA will have a chance to continue that winning streak, boost their NET ranking, squeeze into the AP Top 25 and secure at least a share of the Pac-12 regular-season championship in its season finale against USC on Saturday.",['cap-sam-connon'],"['mens-basketball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.mbb_.nbk_.AB_.jpg

No. 12 UCLA men&#8217;s volleyball (8-9, 2-3 MPSF) lost in four sets to No. 3 UC Santa Barbara (13-2, 0-0 Big West) by scores of 25-23, 18-25, 16-25 and 20-25 on Tuesday night.      After storming back from an 8-4 deficit early in the first set, the Bruins came away with a first-set win, despite hitting .103 in the frame.  &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have the greatest start to the match,&#8221; said redshirt junior outside hitter/setter Sam Kobrine. &#8220;It showed a lot that our team was able to overcome some early struggles and come back and win. Unfortunately, we weren&#8217;t able to carry that on to the next set, but it was very promising.&#8221;     In the second set, UCSB&#8217;s .091 hitting percentage shot up to .333, and the Gauchos never looked back, taking each of the following three sets by at least five points.     In each of sets two through four, UCLA held the lead at least once, but was overpowered by long runs strung together by UCSB. A four-point run in the second, a six-point run in the third and three-point runs in the fourth were good enough to hand the Gauchos their second win over the Bruins this season.  &#8220;I think a lot of those runs, some of them are caused by them &#8211; you know, either a good server that we can just try (to) slow down &#8211; but I think tonight, in a couple of those runs, it was the case that we just weren&#8217;t executing,&#8221; said assistant coach Spencer McLachlin. &#8220;A lot of times, if you take care of that first ball and don&#8217;t let the server get in a rhythm, it makes your life a lot easier, and we didn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;     Last time the Bruins faced the Gauchos this season Feb. 19, UCLA was swept and hit for its lowest hitting percentage of the season. Now, facing the Gauchos on the road, the Bruins pushed the match to four sets, but still hit for .057, their  new lowest mark on the season.     &#8220;(UCSB's) defense, their digging especially, their back row defense, is really some of the best in the country,&#8221; McLachlin said. &#8220;I think their tallest guy is probably 6-foot-7; ... sometimes it's harder to see the smaller blockers, you don&#8217;t know where they are and all of a sudden they're right in your way.&#8221;     Over the course of the match, the Gauchos recorded seven more blocks and eight more digs than the Bruins could muster.     Senior middle blocker Daenan Gyimah &#8211; who led the team with 10 kills &#8211; said the Bruins' passing was also a large reason for the loss.  &#8220;A big part of it is passing. We just weren&#8217;t passing well at all tonight,&#8221; Gyimah said. &#8220;We kind of passed just decent the whole night, and then it got kind of worse as the match went on.&#8221;     While the Bruins have lost three of their past four matches, they&#8217;ve also managed to win at least one set in each of the contests. It&#8217;s the first time this season the Bruins have won a set in four straight matches.

At UCLA, our community is remarkably united by similar feelings of loss, confusion and concern, but also by light, hope and perspective that the pandemic has brought to the forefront. In Columns From Quarantine, Daily Bruin staffers and community submissions highlight the personal stories that mark this unprecedented moment. If you have a quarantine story to tell, you can submit it    here    or email    columnsfromquarantine@gmail.com .   [caption id=""attachment_379133"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Andrea Grigsby/Illustrations Director)[/caption]  I will never forget that it was March 13  three days after we had made one of the biggest decisions in UCLAs history to move the whole campus to remote learning  when I found out that someone I had recently met with had been diagnosed with COVID-19. I certainly had not expected to be exposed so quickly, but the only appropriate action was to immediately self-quarantine and hope for the best.   ""We are fortunate and have no basis for complaint."" I ultimately never developed symptoms, but quarantining in the chancellors residence, my wife, Carol, and I fully appreciate that we dont face the difficulties that many of our employees and fellow Angelenos deal with every day, like self-distancing in more confined housing, sometimes with young children. These challenges understandably place enormous strain on them, and I am so grateful for their resiliency and flexibility. We are fortunate and have no basis for complaint.  What is strange, however, is the eerie quiet in the residence each night. For decades, the residence has been a busy place, especially in the evenings. It was designed and always meant as a place for large gatherings and for people to connect. Some weeks, we host events every night on behalf of UCLA  inviting faculty, students, alumni, donors, members of the community and visiting dignitaries to be honored and recognized for their achievements. Long before Carol and I moved in, the residence was hosting national and international leaders, including Albert Einstein, who visited almost a century ago.  Now, as I look upon the empty spaces where so many inspiring people would often join us, I wonder how long it will be until all of our lives and activities return to something more normal.  Carol and my days have changed rather dramatically since we have been staying at home. I normally do a lot of traveling, with regular monthly meetings in Oakland, California and several meetings a year in Washington, D.C., representing UCLA with our national associations, numerous fund- and friendraising trips, and visits with alumni and Bruin friends throughout the U.S. and around the world. Thus, staying home week after week is highly unusual.   ""I wonder how long it will be until all of our lives and activities return to something more normal."" I guess on the positive side, staying at home has led to improvements in my self-discipline. First, my lifestyle is healthier. Carol and I take regular walks around campus, and we can plan more regular and healthier meals now that were not always rushing off to events. Perhaps most attractive, the lack of travel has freed up a little time to pursue my passion for tinkering. I was able to repair an old tube radio from the 1920s, and it was pretty exciting to hear music from a 100-year-old radio.  I also had a chance to do some inventing. I recognized one of the problems we all have is that we touch our faces many times in an hour, inadvertently putting ourselves at risk for viruses. I thought it would be interesting to design a simple device that warned us each time we touch our faces. I took advantage of an inexpensive pyro detector that is normally used in intrusion alarms and built it into a pendant that can be worn from my neck. Each time I went to touch my face, the alarm sounded. The alarm is annoying, so I have gotten pretty proficient at not touching my face with my hands!  [caption id=""attachment_379134"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""787""]    During quarantine, UCLA Chancellor Gene Block has spent time making inventions such as this pendant, which sounds an alarm when the wearer touches their face. (Courtesy of Gene Block)[/caption]  I even demonstrated it on video for our grandchildren, who were working on their own science projects at the other end of the country. Tinkering has been a nice break from the tension of the current situation, and it gave me high marks with my 8- and 5-year-old grandchildren.  Obviously, most of my time  day and night  is taken up with focusing on the enormous crisis facing our campus, our city and beyond. The crisis has required administrative and faculty leaders to engage in more regular and demanding meetings and decision-making. As an example, prior to COVID-19, the 10 UC chancellors and the president met as a group once each month in Oakland. For the past month, the group has met three times per week on Zoom. And even though our UCLA leaders typically met twice a month as a full group, we now meet three times per week. The chair of the Academic Senate also participates in these meetings. The enhanced contact underscores the point that the situation in Los Angeles is evolving quickly, and the decisions we make now have significant implications for the future of the campus. As you can imagine, the situation in our health care system is even more challenging, and our health care professionals at every level are doing extraordinary work. We owe them our most sincere gratitude.    Zooming with the UCLA Strategic Communications team at their Town Hall. Great seeing all of the UCLA pride as we celebrate  #BruinFridays .  https://t.co/wVsZNV1Yld    Gene Block (@UCLAchancellor)  April 24, 2020       We can be thankful for the powerful information technology infrastructure that allows us to connect with one another without holding a physical meeting. The UCLA team that 50 years ago sent the first message over what would become the internet certainly deserves some credit!  I cannot begin to imagine how those overseeing large organizations did this during the 1918 flu pandemic, back in early days of the telephone, before conference calls  much less Zoom calls  were an option.  I think we are all learning how best to use videoconferencing technology. I deeply appreciate the forbearance of students and faculty as we adjust to this new instructional platform. I am confident that our faculty, students and staff will continue to innovate, modify and create new ways to learn in this virtual space.  While we are still reviewing what fall quarter will look like, I encourage all of you to find your own creative outlets as we go through this. I have no doubt many of you will create amazing works of art, your own inventions or other solutions that could have broad positive impacts.  Ive already seen some wonderful examples of this, such as our student who  developed  a low-cost ventilator with parts he bought at The Home Depot!  Seeing how our community has pulled together, supported one another, gotten creative and demonstrated their UCLA pride is so inspiring, particularly at times like these.  I thank all of you for showing the world what it means to be a Bruin. Take care of yourselves and each other and I have no doubt youll be very good to all those around you.  Go Bruins!

Elizabeth Warren returned to Los Angeles for a final campaign stop Monday night before voters in California, 13 other states and one territory cast their ballots for Super Tuesday.  More than 3,000 people gathered at East Los Angeles College to see Warren support Justice for Janitors, a labor movement sparked by 400 janitors in Los Angeles who were beaten by police while peacefully striking in 1990.  Tonight Im here to honor Latinas who are unsung heroes of the American story, Warren said. Remember the courageous janitors who fought back in 1990? Their legacy lives on. ... Janitors are taking power into their own hands and eradicating workplace sexual violence in an industry where immigrant women are especially vulnerable.  The incident in 1990 launched the janitors struggle onto the national stage, winning them better wages and benefits and expanding the movement across the United States and Canada. Many of the janitors stories are archived by UCLAs Justice for Janitors History Project .  Warren said the movement exemplifies the importance of organizing and planning in promoting a common cause for both labor unions and political campaigns.  The lessons of Latino history are instructive to this moment of crisis, Warren said. Our very democracy hangs in the balance. So we can get timid. We can cower. Or we can fight back like the Latina janitors of a generation ago. Me? Im fighting back.  Warren held the event in East Los Angeles, which has a majority Latino population. Latinos constitute about 40% of Californias population and form a powerful voting bloc for the state, which holds about a quarter of the 1,991 delegates needed for the Democratic nomination.  Latinos are also an important audience for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist who also held a rally in Los Angeles  a day prior. Despite being neck and neck earlier in the race, Warren has fallen behind Sanders in the last four primary contests.  Warren also faces a growing disadvantage against Joe Biden, the moderate frontrunner, who is also visiting LA on Super Tuesday. On the day of Warrens speech, Biden announced endorsements from dozens of prominent figures, including three former Democratic presidential candidates: Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto ORourke.  Nonetheless, Warren congratulated Biden on Saturdays victory in South Carolinas primary contest before pivoting to criticize him.  I respect his years of service, Warren said. (But) nominating someone who wants to restore the world before (President) Donald Trump, when the status quo has been leaving more and more people behind for decades, is a big risk for our party and our country.  Californias First Partner, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who endorsed Warren on Friday, provided one of the opening remarks for the event. Siebel Newsoms husband, Gov. Gavin Newsom, has not endorsed a candidate since the candidate he formerly endorsed, Sen. Kamala Harris, dropped out of the race.  Now, I know a lot of male talking heads on TV have counted (Warren) out, Siebel Newsom said.  Referring to Chris Matthews, the former host of MSNBCs talk show Hardball accused of political bias, she added, One was forced to resign tonight.  Kaitlin Cornuelle, a film producer and director, backed Sanders in the 2016 primary contests but attended Mondays event to support Warren. Cornuelle said the 2016 presidential race and the media today fundamentally changed Americas elections to disfavor candidates like Warren who appeal more to reasoning than empathy.  Given the two front runners and how the media is treating the two front runners, ... I do think it is an emotional race as opposed to a factual race, Cornuelle said. If she's aggressive in her opinions, ... it's taken as an attack on Bernie or an attack on Biden.  However, Cornuelle, who plans to vote for Warren, said Warrens biggest strengths are her articulateness and command of knowledge.  She takes complexity, which has been used as a weapon by the powerful for a very long time to make other people feel powerless, and she breaks it down so articulately and well that it's not a weapon anymore, Cornuelle said. She makes everything understandable. She's like, you can understand it. And if you can understand it, you can change it.  Ashley Miller, a UCLA alumna, supports both Warren and Sanders, but said she prefers Warrens unifying message more than Sanders occasionally confrontational approach.  I think that she's more like this is for all of us, like she's fighting for everyone and not trying to leave anyone behind, Miller said. Not that I necessarily think Bernie's doing that. ... I would support any of the nominees that are in (the race) right now.  Both Cornuelle and Miller agreed that they will vote for the Democratic nominee, no matter who it is, to get Trump out of office.  Seeing how much under Trump and ... how in-depth the neocons and the Republican Party have gone ... to uproot and take advantage of our system, the system needs fixing, Cornuelle said.",['cap-jhan'],"['los-angeles', 'national', 'news', 'uncategorized']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.news_.warrenLAC.JHan_.jpg

In an effort to spread awareness about religion in Los Angeles, the Fowler Museum's curator of Latin American and Caribbean popular arts Patrick A. Polk and Director of Education and Interpretation Amy Landau will lead ""Art and Religion in the City of Angels."" The three hour walking tour, which encompasses North Vermont Avenue, will be the first of a number of activities the Fowler Museum has planned in order to engage UCLA in the broader religious community, Polk said.  &#8220;(Religion) has been a critical issue in the media (and) in scholarship, and folks keep coming back and asking, 'How relevant is religion in contemporary United States?'&#8221; Polk said. ""One of our goals is to explore that by connecting as a museum &#8211; as part of UCLA &#8211; to the community and foster dialogue and connections between these different religious groups.&#8221;   [Related:    DiverseCity Tours takes students to cultural hubs around Los Angeles   ]   The walking tour will visit three major religious landmarks, including the Hollywood Sikh Temple, Founders Metropolitan Community Church and the Self-Realization Fellowship Hollywood Temple. However, the tours will also pass by many other religious sites along Vermont Avenue, such as the Church of Scientology.   Because of its diversity and close proximity to each of these important LA religious sites, North Vermont Avenue was a highly desired location for the tour, Polk said. The rich history of each stop reflects not only religion in the city, but in the United States as a whole, said Philip Deslippe, who is one of Polk's colleagues.  ""Not only are (the locations) different from each other, they are diverse enough to point to the diversity of American religion,"" Deslippe said. ""I think they each say something special in themselves.""  The Self-Realization Fellowship, a temple dedicated to the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda&#8217;s Kriya Yoga dating back to 1920, acts as an example of how much religious history there is in Los Angeles, Deslippe said. Despite many believing yoga was introduced to the city in the 1960s and 1970s, this location proves it has a long history, Deslippe said. Visiting the site will allow participants to see how seemingly recent fads actually have long-running ties to Los Angeles, he said.  Another stop on the tour is the Hollywood Sikh Temple &#8211; one of the country's oldest Sikh sites of worship. The location exemplifies how religion can connect to other spheres in American life, Deslippe said. For instance, he said Amarjit Singh Marwah, a founder of the temple, helped in the election of the first Asian American representative to Congress, showing how religion can also impact the country's political landscape.  ""It is the first Gurudwara to be built after Indian independence in the United States,"" Deslippe said. ""Not only do I think the Hollywood Gurudwara, like the Self-Realization Fellowship, points to the long and diverse history of religion in LA, I think it is also a site where you can stop and see how influential it has been.""  The tour will also demonstrate how LA is viewed from a global perspective at locations such as the Founders Metropolitan Community Church, Deslippe said. The church was founded in 1968 at a time when LGBTQ rights activists were becoming more vocal, he said. Its early involvement in LGBTQ rights demonstrates the rich diversity of religion and paints the city as a harbinger of progressive social movements, he said.    [Related:    Curator discusses historical insights held within Benin bronzes at Fowler Museum   ]   These three religious sites are only a sample of the institutions the Fowler Museum is working with. The museum has been conducting surveys and mapping religious sites along the entirety of Vermont Avenue &#8211; which is approximately 23 miles long &#8211;   since the start of the initiative, Polk said. Because of the avenue's distance, at least two more walking tours are in the works to cover different locations, said Bianca Collins, the curator of public programs at the Fowler Museum.  ""It's incredibly important to create links between what's going on (on) campus, at the museum and what's going on with programming here at the museum with the city at large,"" Collins said. ""This tour on Vermont Avenue is just one example of this.""  The museum still has a number of programs and events planned for the rest of the year to engage the UCLA community with the broader religious sphere, Collins said.

No. 1 UCLA (21-1) softball defeated No. 16 Michigan (14-7) by a final margin of 2-0 in a game that featured eight combined hits from both teams. The win avenges last years 3-1 loss to the Wolverines and evens the series between the two teams in their last six matchups.  It's always a big win against Michigan because we have a competitive game every time we play them, said coach Kelly Inouye-Perez. Bottom line, it builds confidence and we get to practice what were hoping to see in postseason.  Each team cycled through the lineup without notching a baserunner in the first three innings, as both starting pitchers started the game scoreless while totaling four strikeouts each.  A bunt single by junior infielder Briana Perez in the bottom of the fourth marked the first hit of the game for UCLA. Perez stole second to get into scoring position, and freshman outfielder Maya Brady drove her home with a single to right field for the first run of the game.  Junior infielder Delanie Wiszs double to deep center in the next at-bat allowed Brady to score from first, which extended the Bruin lead to 2-0, and UCLA was able to hold onto the lead for the rest of the game.  We were trying to take it one pitch at a time, Wisz said. ""I was just thinking that she has to come to me with one strike, at least one. And if I got one, then I was gonna hit it because my last at bat I had just missed, so I knew she had to come again.  Nearly a year after losing to the Wolverines' starting pitcher Meghan Beaubien last season, the Bruins chased the Michigan sophomore after just 3 2/3 innings Thursday. Beaubien led the Big 10 with a 1.41 ERA coming into the game.  In the matchup between the two teams last season, Beaubien went a full seven innings while giving up just one run.  Perez  one of only two current Bruins to get a hit against Beaubien in last years game  said its a bit of a double-edged sword when it comes to rematches.  We have film on (Beaubien) and everything, but every game is a new game, so it goes both ways, Perez said. Its helpful but it's not.  UCLA sophomore pitcher Megan Faraimo, who was on the losing end of the matchup against Beaubien last season, avenged the loss and picked up her 12th win of the season while pitching a complete game shutout for the 5th time this year.  Michigan shortstop and leadoff hitter Julia Jimenez began the hitting in the game with a single to open the fourth inning, but Faraimo was able to pitch around the runner by striking out the next three batters to retire the side. Faraimo allowed just three more baserunners the rest of the night.  With runners on first and second and nobody out in the top of the seventh, Faraimo struck out the side once again to finish the game. Faraimos 11 punchouts marked the eighth game this season where she has reached double-digit strikeouts.  A couple people got on base (in the seventh) inning, but they weren't hard hit balls, Inouye-Perez said. One thing she is trying to do is really not let the opponent hit the ball hard, and she did that. (Faraimo) stepped up and shut them down.  UCLA will continue in the UCLA/Long Beach State Invitational with a matchup against No. 22 UCF on Friday.",['cap-jon-christon'],"['softball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/hz.sp_.softball.wrap_.CK_.jpg

At UCLA, our community is remarkably united by similar feelings of loss, confusion and concern, but also by light, hope and the perspective that the pandemic has brought to the forefront. In Columns From Quarantine, Daily Bruin staffers and community submissions highlight the personal stories that mark this unprecedented moment.

[caption id=""attachment_380560"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]    (Andrea Grigsby/Illustrations Director)[/caption]  It was March 12. I was sitting in the Kerckhoff Coffeehouse. The air in the coffee shop was different from my regular walk-ins from my past four years. It wasnt the stuffy vibe of looming finals stress in the air, but something tenser. After getting my matcha green tea, I opened my UCLA email inbox like I did every day, but it was far from ordinary. I read an email filled with news that changed the way I saw the future of my final quarter.  For other seniors, they read about the potential loss of Spring Sing, botched study abroad trips and final nights out at Roccos that were going to be canceled. For me, I only saw a blur, fuzziness around my plans to execute my  last big project  at UCLA that involved giving back to my campus community and beyond my last days on campus.  In December, I accepted a nomination to compete in a 10-week competition for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Societys Man &amp; Woman of the Year campaign. My team of 18 college students and myself were set on our goal of raising $50,000 for blood cancer treatment and research throughout all of spring quarter. I still accepted this nomination even though I had never done anything as big as leading a cancer fundraising effort, not to mention my medical school applications that were fast approaching.  Before signing that nomination sheet though, I looked back at the years of studying, friends and moments I had made and realized that I had fun, but it was time to do something different. Signing the sheet solidified that my last moments at UCLA were to be used to give back as an individual who became a better person leaving UCLA and nothing else.  Though I was foreign to this realm of fundraising, I knew others on campus had unfortunately been affected by cancer in their families. So, I invested in developing the first collegiate club for the Leukemia Lymphoma Society, the  LLS Club at UCLA .  Even if I didnt feel the gravity of signing initially, taking on this challenge grew more rewarding each day as I educated the next generation of UCLA students to be empathic, educated and mature by raising awareness about the cause and working with cancer patients.  I could not wait to start my spring quarter.  I could not wait to talk to all my peers about this project and have them donate.  I could not wait to meet with my club members to get to work.  My fellow co-president Michael Schwartz and I literally could not wait, and we booked Ackerman Grand Ballroom for a May cancer benefit concert to accompany this quarter-long fundraising campaign. It was our senior sendoff event that we dreamed of planning since freshman orientation.  Well, that was one weekend before clicking that email in my inbox.  It got harder to be motivated to do this project since none of the pieces of this cancer-fighting puzzle were fitting together anymore. I couldnt imagine what the puzzle could look like at all. The piece of doing on-campus fundraisers like that concert didnt fit with the piece of having spontaneous conversations about this project around campus. The piece of working with other student organizations throughout the quarter got jammed with my damaged piece of walking that graduation stage knowing I had given back in the best way I could have.  The pieces were all over and the weeks were filled with tough days.  But I realized that this feeling was necessary to reflect on how I can adapt in this time. I know that there are tough days ahead since everything is out of our control, but I had to know what tough days feel like to appreciate what good days feel like too. It can only get better because this whole project was about giving back to those whose days cannot be bright all the time.  For example, a cancer patient who has to hear those three words, You have cancer has far greater weight to carry than telling any random person to, Stay at home.  Being able to live every day is a gift taken for granted.  This quarantine realization personally hit me hardest since I had lost my godfather to his decade-long fight against cancer in the beginning of March. As the lone physician in the family, he gave me his final words as a blessing to my hopeful future as a doctor and a reminder to always be impactful wherever I may be. When you put it into perspective, there was a lot I could do as I am willing and able. I even had his words to keep me going.  [caption id=""attachment_380561"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""768""]    Chorbajian lost his godfather to a decade-long battle with cancer in March, which gave him personal motivation to continue pursuing his fundraising efforts virtually. (courtesy of Abraham Chorbajian)[/caption]  My team of college peers transitioned on-campus events and have turned them virtual, our in-person advertising shifted to creative social media marketing, and we pivoted to emphasize funding for the immunocompromised cancer patients who are at greatest risk during this pandemic.  New life was given to something that once seemed unclear and almost broken.  Our goal didnt change, our motivation is still strong, but the date of the competition is now running from May 8 to July 19. We are doing this now since this coronavirus situation will end soon, but cancer doesn't.  So, what could stop me from making light of a once blurry vision of this giving-back project?  This competition has started and were keeping our heads up high for the 10 weeks of this competition  even if were indoors. We do this for all those who cant, even if these circumstances are not ideal.  There are better days ahead and I want to build an even brighter vision.

Actor Dick Van Dyke took the podium to introduce the senator from Vermont, he said, but found out onstage he had not arrived yet.  I love Bernie Sanders, Van Dyke said. I love him. Hes a wonderful man, and hes taller than I am.  Arriving around 30 minutes later, Sanders rallied thousands of his supporters  two days before California and 13 other states, along with the American Samoa, choose their Democratic nominee for the 2020 presidential election. The rally included a concert by the hip-hop group Public Enemy Radio.  Californias 495 delegates make it the biggest prize of Super Tuesday. Sen. Elizabeth Warren will be speaking Monday to advocate for janitors rights in East Los Angeles. Tom Steyer also had a rally scheduled in LA for Monday but canceled it when he announced Saturday he was dropping out of the presidential race.  Sanders won the popular vote in the first three primary contests of the year, becoming the first candidate of either party to ever do so. Political analytics website FiveThirtyEight currently predicts that he is the most likely of the primary candidates to receive a majority of delegates at the Democratic National Convention taking place in July in Wisconsin.  Despite that, the most likely scenario currently is that no candidate will receive a majority of delegates, according to FiveThirtyEight, which would result in a contested convention.  We must develop the strongest grassroots political movement in the history of this country, Sanders said at the rally.  Sanders promised his supporters that his administration would raise the minimum wage, create jobs by rebuilding the nations infrastructure and revamp the criminal justice system. It would end U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and pass sweeping gun control legislation, he said.  The corporate establishment, the political establishment, you are making them really nervous, Sanders said. Theyre really getting quite upset.  Sanders promised, to shouts of Bernie, that as president he would use an executive order to legalize marijuana in every state.  He also promised to nominate to the federal bench and Supreme Court only judges who support the decision of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that formally legalized abortion.  His campaign, he said, would take on President Donald Trump and win.  We are going to defeat the most dangerous president in modern American history, Sanders said.  Other speakers included comedian and actress Sarah Silverman, Bonnie Castillo, the director of the largest national registered nurses union, and Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter.  The nursing union endorsed Sanders, Castillo said.  We have just admitted our first coronavirus patient, and our second, Castillo said. It shouldnt take a global pandemic for us to realize that universal health care is a human right.  More than 30 students from UCLA spent their morning working for Sanders campaign, knocking on doors in Westwood before taking the Metro to the rally, members said. Four also stayed behind after the rally to participate in a training session for student supporters of Sanders.  I feel like Bernie Sanders rallies are low-key concerts, said Dylan Portillo, a third-year environmental studies student and leader of Bruins for Bernie, referring to the rallys several musical performances.  Bernie Sanders position on climate change is one of the reasons Regina Zweng, a doctoral student in ecology and environmental biology at UCLA, said she supports his candidacy.  I see him as the candidate that really understands the scale of what were facing right now as a planet, Zweng said.  Sanders has expressed the same views on the same issues since the 1980s, said David Alvarado, a first-year pre-public affairs student. It means that students can trust him, he said.  Hes got the receipts for everything, Alvarado said.  Attending rallies and seeing thousands of people supporting the same cause is energizing, said Henry Burke, a fourth-year political science student.  I've never felt more inspired, Portillo said. I'm really looking forward to Tuesday.

The primary contest for the Democratic nomination, which started as the most racially diverse in the history of U.S. presidential elections, is now dominated by a top tier of only white candidates. Almost all minority candidates have dropped out of the race.  Even candidates with significant experience and name recognition, such as Sen. Kamala Harris from California and Sen. Cory Booker from New Jersey, quit the contest before the first primaries. Harris, despite her leading position in polls in the middle of last year, told supporters she was ending her campaign in December after failing to raise enough funds to stay competitive in the early primary states.  Businessman and entrepreneur Andrew Yang and former governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick also announced they were ending their respective campaigns shortly after underwhelming performances at the New Hampshire primary Feb. 11. Their departures leave only one candidate of color in the current race: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, who is currently polling at less than 1%.  Natalie Masuoka, an associate professor of political science and Asian American studies at UCLA, said the structure of the primary election that has existed for most of modern history has advantaged white voters, leading to less diversity among candidates.  (The Democratic Partys) voting base really is a base of communities of color, and that share of the Democratic Party is growing over time, but, of course, there is always a function of power, Masuoka said. Swing states are primarily populated by white swing voters, and in that way, the Democratic Party, being a rational actor, really is going to focus on trying to mobilize white voters.  Furthermore, minority candidates have suffered because of the demographic makeup of the predominantly white early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Masuoka said.  Patrick Meara, a second-year history student, said the extensive media coverage of early primary states benefits candidates who perform well with white voters.  It definitely is an issue that a predominantly white state gets to go first with an already exclusionary (caucus) voting procedure, Meara said.  Navkaran Gurm, a second-year public affairs and economics student, said the time commitment required to participate in caucuses is also an obstacle for low-income minority communities.  I do think (the caucus process) targets minority communities from being as involved, said Gurm, who is also a member of the Bruin Political Union. A caucus does require a bigger time commitment from general voters, and not every Democrat living in Iowa has a chance to go to caucuses.  Saman Haddad, a second-year public affairs student, said he thinks the democratic process is incomplete if minorities are disenfranchised or not represented in the voting process.  You cant have a full debate if not everyones at the table, Haddad said. You cant say that youve really made a decision as a state if not all your citizens are voting or are able to vote.  Moreover, candidates of color such as Harris and Booker, despite championing causes important to communities of color, had underwhelming support from black voters. Both black and Latino voters have leaned toward candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont throughout much of the primary contest.  Even at the height of her campaign, Harris was polling at 16% among black Democratic primary voters, trailing 5 percentage points behind Sanders and well behind Biden at 38%, according to a July 2019 Morning Consult poll.  Masuoka said electability is a critical consideration in communities of color  when the alternative is a conservative President Donald Trump administration, some voters of color might consider voting for candidates closer to their interests instead of candidates of color, who are typically considered less likely to win key swing states in a contest against Trump.  Electability is an important feature of making sure that their communities interests are being heard, especially relative to the current administration, Masuoka said.  Jordan Barger, a second-year film and television student, said there is some merit to voting for the candidate that a person most agrees with, but how strongly they wish to defeat the opposition is also an important consideration.  Ideally, you should vote for the person you most agree with ... but if youre trying to be really strategic, then you vote for the person that is more likely to win, Barger said.  The diversity of the initial field may itself have been partly responsible for the failure of any candidate to gain the kind of winning coalition former President Barack Obama gained in 2008, since the vote is splintered between several candidates of color, Masuoka said.  However, students expressed optimism about the remaining candidates and emphasized their diversity of perspective and identities.  Of course, Bernie Sanders is a Jewish man, and with the history of anti-Semitism being what it is in this country, that is significant, and Pete Buttigieg is the first openly gay candidate, Meara said. The race is still a little more diverse than people give it credit for.  However, Buttigieg dropped out of the race March 1, further thinning the diversity of the field.     Gurm said he thinks there is still a wide range of ideologies among the candidates that forces them to continually improve their ideas.  I think there is a diversity of ideologies within the Democratic Party right now ... because theres so many different ideas and so many different candidates in the field, Gurm said. Theyre all pushing each other to be better and to defend their policy ideas and policy goals.  Barger added that she thinks it is particularly important for younger generations, like college students, to vote in the primary elections.  Our generation is the biggest generation right now, Barger said. If we all actually voted, we could make a difference.",['cap-eshan-uniyal'],"['national', 'news']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/2.22.news_.primaries.candidatediversity-01-1-519x1024.png

After finishing the Frisco College Classic with three straight wins, No. 6 UCLA baseball (11-0) returned home Sunday and will immediately hit the road again to take on UC Santa Barbara (9-2) in a one-game, midweek meeting.  Jumping up four spots in the D1Baseball rankings, UCLA has yet to drop a game this season, has outscored its opponents 85-11 and hasn't allowed more than two runs in any game thus far. No. 1 Florida is the only undefeated team ranked higher than UCLA.  Despite UCLA's best start to the season since 2010 &#8211; when the Bruins won 22 consecutive games &#8211; coach John Savage said the win and loss totals shouldn't be his team's focus this early in the season.    ""There's no championship won in February or March,"" Savage said. ""We won 52 games last season and finished on a really tough note. So, it's not about your record right now.""  UCSB will come into Tuesday's matchup riding a four-game winning streak after sweeping Illinois-Chicago over the weekend and taking down Loyola Marymount in its previous midweek contest.  Gaucho second baseman and cleanup hitter Marcos Castanon leads his squad with 16 RBIs and is first in hitting with a .356 batting average in 45 at-bats.  With the Bruins coming off a weekend during which they scored in double figures against both then-No. 18 Texas A&amp;M and Illinois, sophomore infielder Mikey Perez said his team stepped up to its first road challenges of the season and is looking to carry that execution into the coming week.  ""I don't think too much has to be changed,"" Perez said. ""We went into each game locked in and ready to go from pitch one, and I felt that was big for our team. As long as we go in with our game plan, we'll be pretty good.""  Perez reached base on every plate appearance against Illinois, notching two hits, drawing two walks and getting hit by a pitch once. On every occasion, Perez came around to score and led the Bruins with five runs Sunday.  The UCLA bullpen will also enter Tuesday's matchup having only allowed two earned runs all season, and junior right-hander Michael Townsend &#8211; who has made nine appearances in relief &#8211; hasn't allowed a hit in 10 innings pitched.  Townsend said his focus over the weekend was squarely on the Frisco College Classic, and, despite the quick turnaround for the traveling squad, the pitching staff will continue to throw according to its coach's plan.  ""We weren't looking ahead,"" Townsend said. ""We were focused on this weekend, so I haven't really done my homework. But we will treat (the Gauchos) like any other game, and (Savage) always has his homework done and writes up a report.""    First pitch at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium is set for 5:30 p.m on Tuesday.

Coach Mick Cronin said Tuesday he's worried about seeing more of the same Saturday at the Galen Center.  ""I woke up at 5 a.m. today, and Rakocevic just kept getting every rebound and he kept scoring and I was all over (junior guard) Chris Smith,"" Cronin said.  UCLA men's basketball (19-11, 12-5 Pac-12) will pay a visit to crosstown rival USC (21-9, 10-7) on Saturday with the Pac-12 regular season title on the line. A win for the Bruins would secure them at least a share of their first regular season conference championship since 2013, while the Trojans would stay in the race for a bye in the Pac-12 tournament with a win on their end.  Though USC won't be able to catch up to UCLA in the conference standings, a win for the Trojans would give them their second season sweep over the Bruins in the last 10 seasons.  UCLA hasn't been beaten twice by a Pac-12 opponent this season. The Bruins are 6-0 when facing a conference foe in the back end of a two-game season series.  Freshman guard/forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. said there hasn't been a specific reason the Bruins have turned things around against familiar opponents lately, but instead  they've simply adapted to Cronin's style.  ""I would just say everything's really starting to click right now,"" Jaquez said. ""We haven't really changed much, I think we're just really starting to understand the defensive and offensive principles that coach has been trying to put in. And it takes time, and it's finally just coming together right now.""  USC beat UCLA in the teams' first matchup Jan. 11, despite getting only four points and two rebounds out of five-star forward Onyeka Okongwu. The freshman big man leads the Trojans in points, rebounds and blocks per game with 16.2, 8.7 and 2.7, respectively.  ""He&#8217;s got great size, he can score with both hands and he&#8217;s a tremendous rim runner and he can block shots,"" Cronin said. ""The only thing he really doesn&#8217;t do is perimeter shooting.""  Jaquez said between Okongwu, Rakocevic and forward Isaiah Mobley, the Bruins will have their hands full down low.  ""They've just got a lot of big guys on their team,"" Jaquez said. ""They're really physical, but we have big guys as well, so it's going to be a battle of the bigs and rebounding.""  UCLA's top-two bigs &#8211; redshirt sophomore forwards Cody Riley and Jalen Hill &#8211; combined for just six rebounds last time out against USC despite averaging 11.4 per game on the season.  The Bruins lost their last game against the Trojans in front of their only sellout home crowd this season. Freshman guard/forward Jake Kyman, whose mom played for UCLA women's volleyball, said he has been invested in the crosstown rivalry his whole life and is looking forward to experiencing it in enemy territory Saturday.  ""It's pretty crazy, I've been with it since forever,"" Kyman said. ""It's always been in the back of my mind whenever I come to UCLA, like, 'Oh, how's it going to be playing against USC?'""

No. 2 UCLA (17-2, 1-0 MPSF) will travel to Berkeley to face No. 8 California (11-5, 0-1) on Saturday, before heading to Stockton to face No. 23 Pacific (2-11) on Sunday. These will be the Bruins&#8217; first matches since the Barbara Kalbus Invitational third-place match on Feb. 23.  &#8220;I like that we haven&#8217;t played in two weeks,&#8221; said coach Adam Wright. &#8220;(The girls) have put in a great amount of work in the last &#8230; 10-plus days. They&#8217;ve worked hard, so it will be nice to finally play.&#8221;  The Bruins faced the Golden Bears three times last season, claiming two victories. In its lone loss, UCLA struggled to score in the first half, failing to put a single point on the scoreboard before halftime.  On Feb. 22 this year, the Bruins experienced its second loss of the season in a similar fashion, as UCLA fell behind No. 1 USC (12-1, 1-0) by five goals after two periods in an eventual 9-7 loss.  Junior attacker Lexi Liebowitz said in preparation for this season&#8217;s match against California, the team focused on learning from its past experiences.  &#8220;We just want to keep building on the last games we&#8217;ve had,&#8221; Liebowitz said. &#8220;(We want to) keep the good things and work on the things that we need to work on.&#8221;  Wright said the team will look to improve upon is its defense.  The Bruins have not lost a contest in which they surrendered fewer than six goals. Additionally, UCLA has ended 13 of its 17 wins with the opponent at least five goals behind.   &#8220;The defense is really everything for us &#8230; we may not be having our best offensive game, but if we play great defense, then we will have a chance,&#8221; Wright said. &#8220;We know Cal is gonna bring everything they have. They&#8217;re gonna come after us physically, and we gotta be able to make stops.&#8221;  In the past, UCLA's defense has been a good indicator of how a match plays out.  The Bruins' second game of the weekend will feature another familiar opponent, as UCLA and Pacific have played twice this season, with the Bruins prevailing 14-7 and 14-3 on Jan. 25 and Feb. 21, respectively.  In the game at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational on Feb. 21, eight UCLA players combined for the Bruins&#8217; 14 goals. Freshman attacker Hannah Palmer said having a balanced distribution of goal-scorers is a key  to the team&#8217;s success.  ""I feel like it's just that everyone is trying to get involved,&#8221; Palmer said. &#8220;We are all trying to get to the same goal.&#8221;  The Bruins will play California at 12 p.m. on Saturday and face the Tigers at 1 p.m. on Sunday.

Council meetings take place every Tuesday at 7 p.m. and are open to all students. Spring quarter meetings will take place virtually on Zoom; links for the meetings can be found on the internal vice president&#8217;s Facebook    page   . Watch a livestream of the meetings on the    USAC Live! channel    on YouTube.     Public Comment    Lily Shaw, the 2019-2020 USAC Facilities commissioner, said the Los Angeles Police Department used the UCLA-leased Jackie Robinson Stadium as an  arrest processing site . Shaw said the LAPD&#8217;s actions were unjust, and UCLA should have stopped them. Christian Israelian, a second-year political science student, said his sister was arrested and taken to the stadium. He played an audio recording she took of a pregnant woman having a panic attack while detained. Alberto Mancia, a third-year mathematics student, suggested that USAC write a statement to the administration. Karlinna Sanchez, a second-year mathematics student, said UCLA should be more transparent about its communication with university police and LAPD over the incident. Mick Deluca, assistant vice chancellor of Campus Life, said UCLA was not aware that LAPD used the stadium to detain protesters until Tuesday and will not let it happen again.  Grayson Peters, a member of the North Westwood Neighborhood Council Transportation and Safety Committee, said  June 1's protest in Westwood  was mostly peaceful until police fired rubber bullets at the crowd. He added that police made about 10 arrests.  Amanda Gracian, Academic Affairs Commission chief of staff and Academic Senate member, said she was disappointed that the faculty failed to provide accommodations for final exams.  Isis Curiel, a fourth-year English student, said UCLA Housing and UCLA Dining Services should have had better communication with students about the Westwood protest. Students tried to put up posters in dining halls to say that protest was canceled and dining hall managers took them away, she added.    Special Presentations:    Liz Kemper, the director of Student Legal Services at UCLA, offered legal aid to students on cases related to apartment leases, arrests, employment and more. Students can meet confidentially with the SLS on Zoom and all fees will be waived during the pandemic, she added.  Genesis Qu, the 2020-2021 Daily Bruin campus politics editor, said the council could contact him for coverage on the administration and student government. He added that he wants to create a direct line of communication between the Daily Bruin and USAC.  UCPD spokesperson Scott Scheffler addressed questions regarding a Twitter video that has since been deleted. The video showed UCPD officers  approaching a Black man on Kelton Avenue  and ended with the sound of a stun gun being activated. He said the man had assaulted two UCLA-affiliated individuals and had repeatedly resisted arrests. He added that UCPD did not physically use the stun gun on him, but used the sound as a warning.  Promise Ogunleye, 2020-2021 Cultural Affairs commissioner, said it was understandable that the man resisted arrest given the current fear surrounding police brutality against Black people. The suspect said he didn&#8217;t do anything, but he matched the description given by the two victims assaulted, and he had the weapon the victims were assaulted with, Scheffler said. He added that the officers followed standard protocol and that they had to take precautions to ensure safety. He added that the UCPD body cam project, which was initiated by the University of California Office of the President earlier this year, was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project is predicted to resume within a couple of months, Scheffler said. The public can access the UCPD implicit bias training through a California Public Records Act request, he added.  Josh O&#8217;Connor, a spokesperson for UCLA Residential Life, said LA County curfews would change dining hours. He added that dining hall workers would have to get home before the curfew starts, so students would have to to pick up food at earlier times.    Agenda    The council allocated $750 from the Student Wellness Commission to MEChA de UCLA, a student-run advocate group.  The Green Initiative Fund received a request for $35,000 and allocated $10,000 to Counterforce Lab.  The council approved a  resolution  calling for solidarity with the Black community and condemning police brutality. The resolution demanded the demilitarization of Westwood, for UCLA to prevent future misuse of facilities like the Jackie Robinson Stadium, transparency in UCPD arrest data and for UCLA to cut ties with the LAPD.  2020-2021 Internal Vice President Emily Luong nominated third-year physics student Matthew Richard as the Campus Safety Alliance vice chair. 2020-2021 External Vice President Aidan Arasasingham said he opposed the nomination because of allegations of doxing and harassment made against Richard in the fall. Debra Geller, a USAC administrative representative, said that Richard passed the eligibility check for appointments and would otherwise be qualified from a policy perspective.  The council appointed David Minasyan, a third-year economics and psychobiology student, as the Finance Committee chair for the 2020-2021 school year. Minasyan also held the same position as the 2019-2020 chair.  The council appointed Kayla Rafanan, a first-year microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics student, as the budget review director for the Finance Committee.  The council appointed Zeyna Faucette, a second-year African American studies student, as a member on the Associated Students UCLA Board of Directors.  The council appointed Arsh Gupta, a second-year applied mathematics and economics student, as an ASUCLA Board of Directors member.    Reports    2020-2021 President Naomi Riley said her office met with the Academic Senate to address the Afrikan Student Union&#8217;s petition to adjust finals. She added that the Academic Senate could not cancel finals, but encouraged professors to offer accommodations for students. The Academic Senate sent an email to students and faculty Wednesday suggesting accommodations such as opt-out finals, extended due dates and alternate assessments.

Aside from a brief introduction to the Degree Audit Reporting System during New Student Orientation, incoming Bruins are generally left ill-equipped to navigate the competitive enrollment process by themselves.   UCLA offers more than 3,800 courses within 109 departments, and, yet, students are left to pave their own academic road map with minimal help. And combined with  unprecedented levels  of overcrowding, it's no wonder that enrollment is a constant battle for early appointments   and precious class openings.  The current enrollment system is loosely based on the number of units completed. But within a certain range of units, luck is usually the determining factor in enrollment time. After priority groups, enrollment times are randomly distributed based on descending unit count.  UCLA has a responsibility to best prepare its students for success. But lackluster transparency regarding course requirements and lottery-style distribution of appointment times leave many new students behind before they've even started their college career. UCLA has some programs in place already, but it should expand on them to create consistent workshops that would guide students step by step through the process of planning classes, regardless of their year at UCLA.  And at such a large public university, these workshops wouldn't just help students plan classes &#8211; they would increase transparency surrounding the enrollment process and increase interaction between students and academic counselors.  The enrollment process is divided into two sections: first pass and second pass, wherein everyone is limited to enrolling in 10 units for their first pass.  The registrar's office did not respond in time to a request for comment.  But even with these current   systems in place to streamline enrollment, freshmen already feel jaded about the system and its apparent limitations.  Drake Choi, a first-year pre-economics student, said the enrollment process can be especially stressful for students trying to explore their academic options.    &#8220;I was pretty nervous every time I had an enrollment pass just because I was so uncertain about my major that it made enrolling a lot more difficult than it needed to be,&#8221; Choi said.   The current system is set up in such a way that rushes students to claim a certain major in order to stay on track for graduation, leaving them without the luxury to figure out their path and major as they go.  ""I feel like I had a whole plan set up for graduation, but it&#8217;s really hard to graduate on time or at the speed that I want because of the classes that have been limited. I can&#8217;t take the classes that I really want to take, so I&#8217;m left taking classes that I have no interest in,&#8221; said Stephanie Yeo, a first-year psychology student.  Uncertainty is a constant for first-years, but even those on a set path will run into systematic roadblocks that make it nearly impossible to get the classes they're paying tuition for.  This is where UCLA comes in.  The current system is working, but not at its maximum efficiency. Fortunately, UCLA already has the infrastructure to improve that system in the form of hundreds of New Student Advisors and existing orientation programs.  New Student Orientation and Orientation Part 2 are explicitly targeted at first-year students, but by expanding these workshops to all UCLA students and making them more consistent throughout the year, the university could more effectively assist Bruins through multiple enrollment processes.  Even an increase in advertising for current amenities could make a big difference &#8211; Orientation Part 2 would be an extremely effective resource, if anyone knew about it.   And expanding these resources could have long-term effects.  Some upperclassmen who struggled with these problems as underclassmen still feel like they're at a disadvantage.  ""I missed out on a lot of major classes I needed to take because either they&#8217;re filled up by the time my enrollment time came around, or there were some restrictions on it even by the time of your pass that don&#8217;t lift,"" said Paul Shinwoo Kim, a third-year communication student.    This touches upon the problems with availability of information in the current system &#8211; problems that increased transparency and resources could help fix.   Unless students remember to check the warnings on all of their planned classes, they may find unexpected course restrictions. Students who realize that a certain class is restricted during their enrollment are not given the luxury of mapping out their schedules in that instant, potentially jeopardizing their four-year plans in the blink of an eye.  Of course, it may seem that the consistency of the established enrollment system is the best a university with almost 32,000 students can do. However, UCLA's enormous size can also work to its benefit. With students quite literally  paying  their way into overenrolled classes, it's evident that the status quo is far from perfect. But with the multitude of resources UCLA has at its disposal, as well as a multibillion-dollar budget, providing workshops to alleviate the stress of enrollment is the least it can do.   Fixing systemic overenrollment and overhauling an entire system can't be done overnight.   But for now, UCLA should at least take steps to help students through its mess.

No. 1 UCLA softball (19-1) swept all four of its games at the San Diego Classic this weekend after losing its first game of the season Thursday. Junior infielder Briana Perez drove in nine of the Bruins 29 runs for the weekend, while freshman pitcher and San Diego native Lexi Sosa tossed seven shutout innings in two starts.  It was a great opportunity for (Sosa) to have her hometown and family see her for the first time in a UCLA uniform, said coach Kelly Inouye-Perez. There were a lot of expectations and a lot of potential distractions, and for her to be able to lock on and pitch effectively was a great sign of things to come.  UCLA kicked off the weekend with a 10-0 victory over Mount St. Mary's (0-13) in five innings behind Sosas first career complete game. Sosa allowed just three hits and struck out a career-high five batters.  I feel awesome about my performance, Sosa said. And its always awesome to see my family in the background. It was definitely one of my favorite tournaments so far.  Another San Diego native also came through for the Bruins on offense, as freshman catcher Sara Rusconi Vicinanza made her fourth appearance of the year and hit a three-run home run that put UCLA up 8-0 in the fourth.  While the Bruins ended Fridays game early, their games against Weber State (7-13) and San Diego State (14-8) on Saturday were neck and neck and featured seventh-inning rallies by UCLA.  The Bruins found themselves in an early 5-1 deficit after the Wildcats rattled off six straight hits in the first, leading Inouye-Perez to pull junior starting pitcher Holly Azevedo from the game with zero outs recorded.  Sophomore pitcher Megan Faraimo came in and struck out the side to limit the damage, the first three of her 24 strikeouts on the day. Faraimo would go on to allow just one hit across seven shutout innings against the Wildcats and earn her Pac-12-leading 10th win.  UCLA responded to Weber States rally with four runs in the third, capped off by a two-run Perez single that gave the Bruins a 6-5 lead.  Neither team scored again until the seventh, when UCLA strung together another four runs to secure the victory, including Perez's fourth RBI of the game on a double to left-center. Perez scored the Bruins' 10th run of the game on a single from redshirt junior outfielder Aaliyah Jordan.  Perez had another clutch hit in the Bruins second game of the day against the Aztecs, which remained scoreless through the first six innings. With two outs and runners at second and third in the top of the seventh, Perez stepped to the plate and delivered a two-run single to break the tie.  I was just trying to slow the game down, Perez said. I have to give credit to (Jordan) behind me, giving me the confidence to go up there right when I needed it ... and I couldnt have had those RBIs without my teammates getting on base.  On the mound, Azevedo started her second straight game for the Bruins and bounced back with 3 1/3 innings of one-hit ball. Faraimo took over in the fourth and threw another 3 2/3 shutout innings in relief, striking out nine.  UCLA capped off the tournament with a 4-0 win over San Diego (10-11) on Sunday. Perez again drove in the first runs of the game for the Bruins, scoring a pair with a third-inning double.  Overall, Perez batted .615 on the weekend, including .833 with runners in scoring position. She notched three multihit games and reached base 11 times in 17 plate appearances.  I believe (Perez) is the most underrated player in the country, Inouye-Perez said. Shes probably the most athletic Bruin weve had ... but what Ive seen from Perez in 2020 is separate from just finding ways to get on base. Shes coming through in the clutch.""  Sosa threw two scoreless frames against San Diego before handing the ball to junior outfielder Julie Rodriguez, making her pitching debut for UCLA. Rodriguez and Azevedo combined to keep the Toreros off the board in the last five innings for the Bruins' third shutout of the weekend.   Looking ahead   UCLA will next play Tuesday at home against St. Johns (7-13), a team that also played in the San Diego Classic and went 3-2 in its five games, losing to San Diego State and San Diego.  Tuesdays game will be the first time the Bruins and Red Storm have faced off since 2005. However, Inouye-Perez said that wont change UCLAs approach to the game.  Every game is a big game for us, Inouye-Perez said. This last weekend, there werent really big-name teams but there were some close ball games. Weve just got show up and weve got to compete.",['cap-matthew-kenney'],"['softball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.softball.DR_.jpg

No. 12 UCLA men's volleyball (9-9, 2-3 MPSF) defeated CSUN (4-11) in four sets by scores of 26-24, 25-21, 25-27 and 25-22.  The Bruins again started the match with two setters on the court in redshirt junior setter/outside hitter Sam Kobrine and freshman setter/opposite Mads Kyed Jensen, just as they had done in their last meeting when they debuted the lineup against the Matadors on Feb 28.  Coach John Speraw said UCLA started playing with two setters because of an injury to freshman opposite Cole Ketrzynski.  ""(Playing with two setters) depends a lot on the health of Ketrzynski,"" Speraw said. ""When he's healthy, we're probably better in a 5-1.""  After sweeping CSUN the first time with this lineup, UCLA started the rematch down 6-5 in the first set, eventually trailing 20-17 at one point.  The Bruins were blocked once and had three attacking errors before Kobrine was subbed out but were not blocked and had no more attacking errors after.  Speraw said playing with two setters usually does more harm than good.  ""There are definitely complexities that require a lot of training when you're running a 6-2,"" Speraw said. ""It can be really effective in a couple scenarios, but in general the complexity outweighs the benefits unless you really have some real reasons to be in that.""  Kobrine said he prefers having two setters because it diversifies the Bruin offense.  ""I like (a two-setter lineup) a lot,"" Kobrine said. ""It gives us a lot of versatility. Our two setters can step back and pass. We can play the front row setter and mix up (our) setting.""  Kobrine was subbed back in to start the second set.  Despite getting the lead at 3-2 and then never losing it, UCLA hit for .133 in the  second frame after hitting for .375 in the first set, committing eight attacking errors and being blocked four times.  Kobrine was again subbed out with the score  at 22-19. The Bruins finished the rest of the set with two kills and zero attacking errors.  Senior outside hitter Austin Matautia hit for .167 with six attacking errors in the match. He said having two setters on the court at the same time can get confusing for the Bruins.  ""There's going to be moments where (the team doesn't) realize who's setting if we go into a long rally,"" Matautia said.  UCLA hit for .194 in the third set, but had match point with the score 24-21. The Bruins proceeded to lose the next four points on a service error and two blocks and a kill by CSUN, and faced set point themselves being down 25-24.  UCLA came back after a service error by the Matadors but then lost the set on a service error by senior middle blocker Daenan Gyimah and attacking error by freshman outside hitter Alex Knight. The third set win by the Matadors was the first time this season CSUN had claimed a set against a ranked opponent.  The Bruins started the fourth set on a 3-0 run and never trailed the rest of the set, clinching the set and the match on a kill by Kobrine assisted by Kyed Jensen.  UCLA's  next match is slated for 5 p.m. at home on Saturday against No. 6 UC San Diego. ",[],"['mens-volleyball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.mvb_.wrap_.SG_.jpg

UCLA was led by senior swimmer Kenisha Liu and junior diver Ruby Neave.  Liu started the meet off with a career-best time as the leadoff swimmer in the 800-freestyle relay with a time of 1:44.37. Coach Jordan Wolfrum said Liu&#8217;s performance helped spark a fire in the team and drive momentum for the great finishes ahead.  &#8220;The very first night and in the very first scoring event, (Liu) led off with a lifetime best and top 30 in the country, and I think that moment gave her team a lot of confidence and a lot of excitement,&#8221; Wolfrum said.   Liu&#8217;s performance also solidified her qualification for the NCAA championship in the event, and she now ranks No. 19 in the country.  On the diving side, Neave won the 1-meter springboard competition with a season-best score of 329.30, making her the third straight Bruin to win the title. Neave also finished third in the 3-meter springboard event.  Diving coach Tom Stebbins said the victory meant a lot to Neave.   &#8220;It was exceptional, but not only that, she really did it in dramatic fashion and we were kind of working two options for her dive,"" Stebbins said. ""And after the prelims, we kind of decided to make some moves in the order. She got rewarded for it and ended up moving up ahead of those kids by a couple of points and winning the meet. It was a really exciting way for that to really unfold, and to see her have that moment and that success was really special.&#8221;  Neave said she had a successful outing because of her ability to avoid putting pressure on herself.  &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to put any crazy expectations on myself and just go out there and have a good crack at it,"" Neave said. ""It was three or four of us&#8217; first time competing at Pac-12s, and we didn&#8217;t have a crazy amount of pressure, and we just had a chance to go out there and do the best we could.&#8221;   The Bruin swimmers also set a new school record in the 400-yard medley relay with a time of 3:33.81. Wolfrum said the performances she saw from the entire team during the championship impressed her and exceeded what had previously been expected of the team.  &#8220;I was really pleased with our performances from top to bottom. We outscored our seeded time and our seeded places, which is really exciting. We were predicted to score about 600 points in total and we almost hit a thousand,&#8221; Wolfrum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of our biggest ways to qualify for NCAAs, and that is an important chance for us.&#8221;  The Bruins had 14 swimmers qualify for the finals for their respective events, including senior Amy Okada, who finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly.  Okada said the Bruins' trip to Washington was special to her, as she is set to graduate in June.   ""I just enjoyed every moment since it's my last Pac-12s,"" Okada said. ""I just enjoyed coming off the bus, listening to music with everyone and watching the parents dance and cheer for us.""   UCLA will now turn its attention to the beginning of NCAA competition, starting with next week's NCAA Zone E Diving Championships, which will run March 9 through 11.  &#8220;The (Pac-12 championship) is great preparation for zones, and the conference is loaded,"" Stebbins said. ""There are great coaches and great athletes. It is a difficult meet to get through. You have to be really tuned up, have to feel good, have to look good and you have to be good.&#8221; ",[],"['sports', 'swim-dive']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.sd_.wrap_.AD_.jpg

Except with a softball bat instead of a baton, and the only loser being the opposing pitcher&#8217;s ERA.  &#8220;Pass the bat is our team motto,&#8221; said Washington. &#8220;It&#8217;s about trying to get as many people up to bat as possible.&#8221;  Eight first-inning runs were all that No. 1 UCLA softball (20-1) would need in its eventual 9-0 victory over St. John&#8217;s (7-13) on Tuesday night. The Bruins entered the game averaging more than two runs scored in the first inning alone, with 45 total runs, more than they&#8217;ve scored in any other inning.  Prior to St. John&#8217;s pitcher Angela Saric&#8217;s early departure after only 2/3 innings of work, UCLA batted through the lineup, recording four hits and two walks, and taking advantage of two errors by the Red Storm.  Junior shortstop Briana Perez got the scoring started with an RBI double to knock in Washington. Two at-bats later, freshman utility Maya Brady doubled in Perez on a shot through the right side of the infield &#8211; advancing to third on an error &#8211; to match Perez&#8217;s team-leading 26 RBIs.  Washington, in her second plate appearance of the inning, capped the Bruins&#8217; rally with a line drive three-run home run to right field &#8211; the third round-tripper of her UCLA career.  Washington credited her work with first-year volunteer assistant hitting coach Don Slaught for her two-hit, four-RBI night.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve been really practicing with (Slaught), trying to add more power to my game, so to see it play out in the game is really cool,&#8221; Washington said.  While the Bruins were providing valuable run support, starting pitcher freshman Lexi Sosa transitioned from sitting idly by in the dugout to warming up in the bullpen, waiting to head back out to the circle for the top of the second.  Sosa walked the first batter she faced that frame. Coach Kelly Inouye-Perez and assistant coach Lisa Fernandez called time to settle down the freshman pitcher for the rest of her five-inning shutout performance &#8211; her second in five days.  ""(Fernandez) called a timeout and had a little chat with her, and then you saw (Sosa) show up and pounding the zone and getting after it,"" Inouye-Perez said. ""But those are part of the dynamics &#8211; if your team puts up eight runs, you can&#8217;t give it right back to them.""  The next play was a line out to junior third baseman Delanie Wisz, in which she doubled off the first base runner.  Sosa prevented every St. John's base runner from advancing past first base and established a new career-high in strikeouts for the second time in a span of five days, with seven batters sent down swinging.  ""I&#8217;ve definitely (gotten more comfortable),"" Sosa said. ""I&#8217;m just sticking to what I know, and I know the girls are right behind me.""  Inouye-Perez said she's seen Sosa adapt over the past week to college softball and found her groove in the rotation after beginning her first four pitching appearances with a 4.20 ERA.  ""A big part of college is that there&#8217;s an emotional transition from just being a dominant (high school) senior to thinking there&#8217;s something you need to do differently in the college game. ... That was by far the most impressive outing (Sosa's) had,"" Inouye-Perez said. ""She threw the hardest she&#8217;s thrown. ... She was working ahead in the count, she got out of some jams. That&#8217;s the Sosa we know."" ",[],"['softball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.softball.DLB_.jpg

No. 10 UCLA baseball (10-0) beat No. 18 Texas A&amp;M (10-2) 10-2 on Saturday in its second game of the Frisco College Classic to notch its tenth consecutive win to open the season. The win was the Bruins first against a ranked opponent in 2020, and they recorded season highs in hits and walks and tied a season low in runs allowed.  The offense got the scoring going early, plating two runs in the top of the first inning for the third game in a row. Redshirt junior designated hitter Jarron Silva  hitting in the No. 2 spot  singled with one out, and the next batter  sophomore shortstop Matt McLain  hit his team-high third home run of the season. The shortstop also leads the Bruins with 13 RBIs this year.  The Aggies got a run in the bottom of the first after the leadoff hitter, second baseman Bryce Blaum, struck out but reached first base on a dropped third strike. Sophomore right-hander Nick Nastrini threw two wild pitches to the next batter, advancing Blaum to third base, before he scored on a groundout.  In the top of the second, UCLA had the bases loaded with only one out, but failed to score. The second inning was the first of five frames that the Bruins left multiple runners on base, running up their tally up to 15 in the game.  After leaving the bases loaded an inning earlier, the Bruins came back with another two-run home run in the third. Senior left fielder Kyle Cuellar hit his first home run of the season  his first long ball since March 10, 2017, against Texas  extending the Bruins lead to three.  UCLAs biggest inning of the day came in the sixth, when the team scored four runs, bringing the score to 9-2. Sophomore catcher Noah Cardenas, sophomore second baseman Mikey Perez, junior center fielder Garrett Mitchell and Silva all helped knocked in runs in the frame.  Making his third start of the season, Nastrini went five innings and gave up two runs. The righty allowed only one hit  a one-out home run in the fourth inning by catcher Hunter Coleman  but walked four Aggies and hit one   batter. Nastrini finished the game with a season-high eight strikeouts.  After Nastrini was pulled, the Bruins bullpen combined to throw four no-hit innings, walking three while striking out six. The bullpen has allowed just two earned runs in 36.1 innings of work this season  good for a 0.49 ERA.

No. 12 UCLA men&#8217;s volleyball (8-8, 2-3 MPSF) lost to No. 4 Long Beach State (9-1) in five sets by scores of 25-21, 16-25, 25-17, 23-25 and 15-13.  The Bruins dropped the first set, hitting for .040 while allowing the Beach to hit for .353. Both teams had nine kills in the set, but the Bruins had five more attacking errors with a total of eight for the frame. Long Beach State also had four blocks to UCLA's two.  Freshman setter/opposite Mads Kyed Jensen started the second set for the Bruins with three straight service aces. UCLA won eight of the 10 second-set points in which Kyed Jensen served. He also accumulated four kills throughout the set before clinching it with another service ace.  Coach John Speraw said Kyed Jensen&#8217;s serving made up for inconsistent hitting.  &#8220;For us, (Kyed Jensen&#8217;s service pressure) was everything because our hitting percentage is a little variable,&#8221; Speraw said.  The Beach started the third set with a 3-0 run of its own on two kills and a block from middle blocker Shane Holdaway. Holdaway finished the match with nine kills en route to a team-high .727 hitting percentage.  UCLA was able to tie the set at 13-13 before Long Beach State went on a 10-3 run, eventually winning the set 25-17.  In a back-and-forth fourth set that featured three lead changes, neither team led by more than four points. Despite allowing the Beach to hit for .514 in the set, the Bruins hit for .459 themselves and had two service aces to their opponent's zero. The Bruins clinched the set on a kill from freshman outside hitter Alex Knight, tying the match at two sets apiece.  With the fifth set tied 3-3, the Beach went on a 5-1 run to lead 8-4 before UCLA won the next two points on a service error by Long Beach State and a service ace by Knight. The teams traded the next four points before a service ace by Kyed Jensen pulled the Bruins within one point at 10-9.  The squads again traded the next four points before a kill from outside hitter Spencer Olivier put the Beach up 13-11. After a UCLA timeout, an attacking error by the Bruins put the Beach at match point.  A service error by Long Beach State and a block from UCLA put the score at 14-13 before redshirt junior outside hitter/setter Sam Kobrine served the ball into the net, ending the comeback.  Kyed Jensen said trailing early in the fifth set put UCLA at a disadvantage.  &#8220;In the last set, it&#8217;s all about getting a good start,&#8221; Kyed Jensen. &#8220;That&#8217;s just the bread and butter in five-setters.&#8221;  Kobrine and Kyed Jensen were often on the court together splitting setting duties. Kyed Jensen led the team with 26 assists, with Kobrine right behind him with 18.  Senior middle blocker Daenan Gyimah said having two different setters allows for flexibility offensively.  &#8220;It&#8217;s great having (two different setters out there),&#8221; Gyimah said. &#8220;People get to hit off the setter that sets them better. (Senior outside hitter Austin Matautia) gets to hit off of Kobrine, I get to hit off of (Kyed Jensen).&#8221;   UCLA is coming off a 3-0 sweep of CSUN by scores of 25-22, 25-19 and 25-18. The Bruins hit for .421 as a team while holding the Matadors to a .216 hitting percentage. Matautia was second on the team in kills with eight and hit above .250 for the first time since Jan. 30 against then-No. 13 Princeton.  UCLA's next match will be Tuesday at the Thunderdome in Santa Barbara against No. 3 UC Santa Barbara.

The   play  , produced by 42nd Street Moon in San Francisco, features   alumna Teressa Foss, who portrays Miss Shingle, a maid to the wealthy D&#8217;Ysquith family in turn-of-the-century England. Miss Shingle served a young D&#8217;Ysquith daughter who was disinherited from the family for marrying an unsuitable man and producing a child.    Running until March 15 at the Gateway Theatre, Foss' role begins when a maid arrives at her doorstep to inform her that her son is the potential heir to an incredible fortune. Foss said the intimate size of the venue allows the audience members to immerse themselves in the production, almost as if it were dinner theater.    &#8220;We get up close and personal,"" Foss said. ""The impact of the comedy is even more heightened, the door-slamming farce aspect of it. It&#8217;s kind of like 'Downton Abbey' meets Disney&#8217;s Haunted Mansion.""   [Related:    Theater production challenges traditions via magical realism, diverse characters   ]    Foss herself is no stranger to small, intimate performance spaces. When she graduated from UCLA in 1992, Foss said she played plenty of 99-seat theaters while she was cutting her teeth as an actress. But even after having recently performed at the 1,200-seat Opera San Jos&#233;, she said she likes performing musicals in small spaces because she can use her natural voice without amplification from microphones.  Foss said she grew up performing community theater in California central coast towns like Carmel and Monterey, where the budget for body microphones and audio technology was virtually nonexistent. Given her background, Foss prefers to perform with her sound hitting audience members directly.  However, music director Daniel Thomas still found it challenging to scale down the original production to fit the space of the Gateway. He said the play is ideal for smaller spaces  , but   the music was written for a 12- to 15-person chamber orchestra that he had to reduce to three &#8211; a pianist, keyboardist and woodwind player who cycle through instruments as the music necessitates.   &#8220;Because (the play) is very much a chamber piece with elements of operetta and light classical style, having a lot of oboe, English horn and clarinet creates a sound that still remains authentic to the composer&#8217;s intention while allowing us to do it in an intimate space,&#8221; Thomas said.   The sounds he didn&#8217;t have to worry about, however, were the actors themselves, who Thomas said are all capable singers. Foss performs one of the first numbers of the show called &#8220;You&#8217;re a D&#8217;Ysquith,&#8221;  which she sings to the main character, Monty, informing him of his parental legacy. All of Foss' singing and acting is done in full-costume of the time period, including a rather restrictive corset that she said challenged her during early rehearsals.   Foss said several of the actors donned their corsets as soon as they were available because it completely changes one&#8217;s posture and breath. During early choreography work, she said the actors could allow their torsos to be fluid and curve back and forth across the performance space. But that sort of movement was impossible in a corset ,so they had to begin practicing while wearing the restrictive garments as soon as possible, which Foss said was invaluable to her acting process.   &#8220;(The costume) really informs the character because of course the people of the time would wear these corsets,&#8221; Foss said. &#8220;It really changes you from a 21st-century person into somebody living in London in 1909.&#8221;   [Related:    Rob Clare will highlight women&#8217;s woes in his version of &#8216;Troilus and Cressida&#8217;   ]   Because of the play's time period and setting, director Daren A.C. Carollo said proper diction and pronunciation both in dialogue and song were paramount to audience satisfaction. Unlike perennial musicals such as ""Les Mis&#233;rables,"" in which a large portion of the audience may already know the lines and songs, Carollo said this is likely to be the first time an audience member has ever seen ""A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder."" Carollo said audience comprehension is so critical to the the comedic effect of the show, that he had actors drill their lines and master the lyrical pronunciation of early 20th-century British accents at every rehearsal.  ""The No. 1 thing we do as storytellers is say the words and sing the lyrics,"" Carollo said. ""We want to be word for word, and we want to enunciate clearly. ... The diction and enunciation is very specific.""     For many of the actors though, this wasn't the first time speaking with an English accent. Foss said she found a great deal of influence from the Victorian-era comedies of theatrical duo Gilbert and Sullivan, many of which she&#8217;s performed in herself. In addition, she drew from two characters in the British melodrama ""Downton Abbey."" Foss said the busy-bodied, no-nonsense chef Mrs. Patmore and the supportive lady&#8217;s maid Anna influenced her performance in Love and Murder. But no matter the source, Foss said the artistic influence she needs is always out there.     &#8220;If you stay involved with what other people are doing artistically, you find as you go along that you can pull in a lot of other references and energies without even realizing that you&#8217;re doing it,&#8221; Foss said.

No. 21 UCLA men's golf tied for fifth place after three rounds across three days at the Southern Highlands Collegiate in Las Vegas. The Bruins finished nine over par and tied with No. 1 Pepperdine, a team that has placed above UCLA in both of the team tournaments this spring.  The Bruins were in third place after one day of play, but dropped into fifth on the second day and were never able to climb back up the leaderboard.  Though coach Derek Freeman said earlier in the week he was concerned with the team's ability to stay consistent across three rounds of golf, as compared to one or two, the team actually fared the best in its final round of play Tuesday, shooting a 1-under 287.  ""This is one of the more difficult golf courses, (and) we played in pretty tough conditions, so I think we're all trending in the right direction going into postseason,""  said junior Devon Bling.   Bling shot 4-under 68 in his third round, with birdies on No. 5-7 and 13, and an eagle on No. 16. He finished with a team-best 7-under 209 after three days to place third overall.   ""It's always nice to be contending in a tournament, especially in one of the better fields we play in,"" Bling said. ""I know that my game is pretty solid, even though I honestly didn't really have my best stuff out there this week.""  After the first day of play, UCLA was in striking distance of the lead, sitting five strokes over par and six strokes behind the leader USC. Bling was in third, and senior Hidetoshi Yoshihara was tied for fourth.  Monday's round saw UCLA fall to fifth place after just one Bruin &#8211; sophomore Bryan Wiyang Teoh &#8211; finished below par, going from being tied for 40th to tied for 27th. Yoshihara shot even, and the rest of the team was over par, leading to a 5-over 293 team score &#8211; a repeat performance from the day prior.  Yoshihara said there were difficult conditions because of the wind on the first two days of play.  ""This was my third time playing the same tournament, so I kind of knew the course pretty well and more than anyone else,"" Yoshihara said. ""It was different conditions this year because it got windy the first two days, but it's the same course and same strategy, so it was great.""  Yoshihara finished the second round in 10th and ultimately finished the tournament tied for 13th with a 1-under 215.  The Bruins' score card was rounded out by a tie for 26th place from Teoh, a tie for 67th place from junior Eddy Lai and a tie for 80th place from freshman Tony Hendricks.

In the Pac-12 South tournament, No. 2 UCLA beach volleyball (7-2) will take on Arizona State (3-3, 0-1 Pac-12) and No. 5 USC (3-2) on Saturday before hosting Oregon (2-2) and Washington (2-1) on Sunday.  UCLA won its first game of the year at the new Mapes Beach courts against LMU (3-3), and coach Stein Metzger said the environment on the home sand was more advantageous for his squad.  The elements here are different than any other place, Metzger said. At LSU, we had to play in their hard-packed sand, (but) here we tend to have deeper sand where ball control is at a premium. We're looking forward to playing our style of ball on our surface.  UCLA is coming off its second loss of the season to No. 1 LSU (8-2), which came at the conclusion of last weekends Tiger Beach Challenge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Metzger also said he trusts his team as it prepares for Pac-12 play in Westwood after it went 2-1 last weekend, with four pairs dropping at least one match.  We're making small adjustments to our serve and pass game, but I have full confidence that we have the right pairs and they're going to do great, Metzger said.  One of the losing pairs last weekend was senior Savvy Simo and sophomore Abby Van Winkle, who were swept 21-18, 22-20 on the first court by the Tigers.  Van Winkle  who was paired last year with then-senior Zana Muno and then-sophomore Lindsey Sparks  said it has taken time to develop chemistry with her new partner.  (Simo) and I definitely had a later start just because I had an injury before coming (this year), so now we are finally getting our game together and clicking well, Van Winkle said.  UCLA's match against USC is a rematch of last year's national championship. The Trojans were the only team to defeat the eventual-national champion Bruins during the season, beating their crosstown rivals three times.  Metzger said USC provides length on their side of the net  with 6-foot-1 Haley Hallgren and six-foot-tall Kyla Doig on the Trojans' first two courts  and UCLA will need to adjust.  USC has some fairly physical, tall athletes who can hit the ball well, so we're just trying to get them off the net and put them in situations where they can't use their firepower, Metzger said.  UCLAs other opponents this weekend  Arizona State, Oregon and Washington  are all unranked, and are three of seven teams in the conference not in the country's top 20.  Junior Lea Monkhouse  a winner of both of her games last weekend against Tulane and LSU with partner senior Lily Justine  said the team will be sure not to overlook any opponent in the country, regardless of ranking.

Coming off their first loss of the season, No. 6 UCLA baseball (11-1) will play three games in the Southern California College Baseball Classic, which will be their last non-conference matches before Pac-12 play starts next weekend.  The Bruins will begin by hosting two ranked opponents  No. 2 Vanderbilt (11-3) and No. 22 TCU (10-2)  at Jackie Robinson Stadium, before taking to the road to face rival USC (7-4) at Dedeaux Field, downtown.  The tournament, previously known as the Dodger Stadium Baseball Classic, has a new name in its 10th year, as Dodger Stadium is undergoing renovations and unable to host the classic in 2020.  UCLAs first test will come Friday against the reigning NCAA national champion, Vanderbilt. Following a 59-win season in 2019, the Commodores opened 2020 by losing two of their first three games but have since gone 10-1 over their last 11 games.  UCLA is 1-2 all-time against Vanderbilt, with their last matchup being a 6-3 Commodore victory in this same tournament two years ago.  UCLA will then face TCU on Saturday, whose offense leads the four teams competing in the classic with 95 runs. TCU will be UCLA's only matchup where the Bruins own a winning all-time record, as they are 4-2 against the Horned Frogs.  The Bruins will travel to USC to play their final game of the tournament Sunday. The Trojans 77 runs scored and 2.39 ERA are the worst marks in those categories by any of the classic's competitors.  Throughout the weekend, the Bruins pitching staff  whose .79 WHIP and 1.43 ERA are good for first- and second-best in the country  will look to get back on track after surrendering a season-high eight total runs to UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday.  Junior right-hander Zach Pettway, sophomore right-hander Nick Nastrini and sophomore right-hander Jesse Bergin will start the three games for the Bruins this weekend.  The game against Vanderbilt will begin at 6 p.m. on Friday, followed by TCU at 2 p.m. on Saturday and USC at 3 p.m on Sunday.

Off a nonconference schedule, where the Bruins posted 8 sweeps, coach Stella Sampras Webster said the Bruins will need to rely on their past success but be ready to make adjustments on the road.  The players are pretty experienced to know that there's going to have to be adjustments Sampras Webster said. Its not going to be a perfect day with everything going our way. We are going to have to make adjustments and understand that we can't let any distractions get in the way.""  The Bruins previously swept both the Bears and the Cardinal, with Cal falling to UCLA on Feb. 21 in nonconference action, and Stanford losing 4-0 in the semifinals of the ITA national indoor championship in Chicago on Feb. 9.  We are their chance of getting into the tournament, so we understand that everyones got our name circled because it's a great opportunity for them Sampras Webster said. They are going to play very loose and so, we're going to have to expect that and hopefully get off to a good start.  Then on Saturday in Stanford, the Bruins will face off against the Cardinal, who hasn't lost a match since the ITA national indoor championship. Since then, Stanford has defeated UC Davis, TCU, then-No. 3 Texas and Saint Marys.  With Stanford's 5-0 record at home so far this season, Sampras Webster said the Bruins must be ready to deal with distractions as they head to the Taube Tennis Center at Stanford.  It could be the crowd, could be bad calls  we're going to have to be mature and be professional out there to be able to maintain our level of play, Sampras Webster said. And we hopefully can play our aggressive style and not get caught in the what ifs or with any doubts so we can go play our game.

The Bruins will make their first appearance at the tournament this weekend, and they are set to face a field of teams they have yet to see this year.  UCLA is just four days from the Southern Highlands Collegiate, in which the Bruins tied for fifth.  ""It's a completely different golf course and a completely different test of golf,"" said junior Devon Bling. ""We need to add a few shots to each of our bags for next week.""  Bling was UCLA's top finisher Tuesday, placing third with a 7-under 209. As a team, the Bruins finished behind four top-25 teams and tied with No. 1 Pepperdine.  There are currently seven teams listed as participants in the upcoming field at the Brandon Dunes Championship, not including UCLA. Of those seven opponents, just one is ranked  No. 12 Washington.  Bling said the Bruins are capable of finishing at the top of any tournament, regardless of the competition.  ""When all of us on our team are playing well, we can beat any team in the country for sure,"" Bling said.

UCLA entered its third and final game of the Frisco College Classic with the pitching staff allowing 3.9 hits and one run per game to its opponents, and the Bruin offense tallying 10.3 hits and 7.1 runs per game over their first 10 outings of the season.  No. 10 UCLA baseball (11-0) did almost exactly that on the mound Sunday against Illinois (5-4), limiting the Fighting Illini to four hits and one run, while the Bruins&#8217; bats scored 14 runs on 17 hits &#8211; both offensive season-highs &#8211; en route to a 14-1 victory.  &#8220;We proved that we could play pretty well at home,&#8221; said coach John Savage. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be able to go and play on the road. There were some good signs, and we got what we wanted out of the weekend.&#8221;  Sophomore right-hander Jesse Bergin surrendered his first earned run of the season in the game&#8217;s opening inning on a double by Fighting Illini first baseman Kellen Sarver. Bergin allowed four hits and walked three while striking out six in his third start of the season.  UCLA trailed for less than two innings, as its 14 unanswered runs began with a two-spot in the bottom of the second inning. Sophomore second basemen Mikey Perez&#8217;s one-run double tied the game, and senior catcher/designated hitter Will McInerny followed one batter later with an RBI single of his own to bring home Perez and give the Bruins the lead.  Perez entered the classic batting 1-for-9 on the season, but was 5-for-10 in UCLA's three games this weekend, including going 2-for-2 with a career-high five runs scored against Illinois.  &#8220;Making an emphasis to slow down and not do too much ended up working a lot better for me,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;Learning from previous games, I was able to see the ball a lot better today and put a couple good swings on some balls.&#8221;  Following Bergin&#8217;s departure after five innings, the bullpen combined to tally five strikeouts over four perfect innings to end the game. With 11 total strikeouts against the Fighting Illini, the Bruins' pitching staff has now recorded double-digit punch-out totals in nine of its 11 games this season.  &#8220;Our bullpen&#8217;s been incredible; that&#8217;s not even a question,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;They make it a lot easier on the defense because they&#8217;ve been so locked in with their pitches and Savage&#8217;s pitch-calling.&#8221;  Junior right-hander Michael Townsend &#8211; who has yet to allow a hit this season &#8211; induced a groundout by an Illinois pinch hitter to end the sixth inning and complete the equivalent of a nine-inning no-hitter over his nine appearances out of the bullpen to begin the season. Townsend returned in the seventh inning and struck out the side in order, finishing with four strikeouts against five batters in 1 2/3 innings pitched.  &#8220;That&#8217;s a testament to (Townsend&#8217;s) work ethic,&#8221; Savage said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a tremendous worker, team player. The pitching staff trusts (Townsend). He&#8217;s becoming a really high-end, dependable reliever.&#8221;  The Bruins will end their road trip against UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday at 5:30 p.m, before playing two home games in next weekend's Southern California College Baseball Classic.

Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, millions of Americans are staying home to stop the spread of the virus. As we attend virtual Zoom lectures at home and watch old Snapchat memories of college friends and happier times, it can be hard to stay positive.  For dogs, cats and other pets, though, more time at home means more quality time with their owners  and it turns out the interaction is just as good for us as it is for them.  On the surface, there are many obvious reasons to love our pets. Whether your pal is a bird, puppy or bearded dragon, these creatures can be fun to play with and observe,   provide us with company and become our best friends.     However,   the advantages of having a pet go beyond just having a companion to hang out with. Scientific research shows that owning a pet has numerous physical and emotional health benefits, too. For example, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website , our pets' company can help us counteract feelings of loneliness and depression.  [ngg src=""galleries"" ids=""1182"" exclusions=""83,1547,2330,2389,2922,2961"" display=""basic_imagebrowser""]  Not surprisingly, pets have always been a crucial part of the lives of their owners  but while many of us stay at home, pets may be more important than ever.  Garrett Kukier, a second-year chemistry student, said his dog Rasko has recently been a grounding force for him while he remains at home for the majority of the day.  ""An escape I have in the confines of those walls is taking Rasko out on a walk everyday,"" Kukier said. ""And it has become a family venture (for)   the three of us who are on a walk.""  Kukier also   said he finds comfort in knowing his dog is right there with him while he is   separated from friends.  [caption id=""attachment_379859"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""690""]  Studies have shown that spending time with our pets is mutually beneficial. Second-year chemistry student Garrett Kukier said his dog Rasko has been a grounding force for him while in quarantine. (Ashley Kenney/Daily Bruin)[/caption]  Similarly,   Shaddy Zbib, a third-year biochemistry student,   said that just seeing his pet there has made him feel happier.  (Animals) make the time pass by faster, and I'm just an animal person in general,""   Zbib said. ""So I just tend to get very happy when I see an animal.  Zbib procrastinates by playing with his pet bird Kiwi, a sun conure, and sometimes the five minutes budgeted for playtime stretches into an hour. Kiwi also attends classes with Zbib, his favorite class   being physical chemistry.  It's no wonder that pet owners like Kukier and Zbib enjoy spending time with their pets, especially during a period   when many of us feel stressed by coronavirus or by the routine pressures of school and work. In fact, simply having a routine playtime or walk with your pet can decrease your triglyceride levels, cholesterol and even blood pressure, according to the CDC.  For dogs in particular, it has been found that just looking into your dog's eyes can make you feel happier. This happens as a result of an increase of a hormone called oxytocin, commonly known as the ""love hormone,"" which may help with anxiety, depression and even gut health.  If that's not enough, one of the proven long-term effects of dog ownership is a reduced risk of death, according to an article published by Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, a journal of the American Heart Association. When taking into account   all causes of death, dog owners showed a 24% decrease in risk compared to those without dogs. That number   becomes 31% for decreased risk of   cardiovascular death in particular.  Much to the benefit of our well-being and the animals that need homes, there has been an increase in adopting and fostering pets during this tumultuous time.  Compared to 2019, the Los Angeles and New York City programs of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have seen a 70% rise in foster care support, according to   the president and CEO of the organization Matt Bershadker. In addition, many shelters across the nation reported an  surge  of community members stepping up to adopt and foster furry friends in need.     Likewise, Ben Lehrer, president of Kitten Rescue, and Jack Hagerman, vice president of communications at the Pasadena Humane Society &amp; SPCA,   told the  Los Angeles Times  that their organizations were receiving large spikes of interest.  Lacey Cappos, a fourth-year psychology student, and her roommates recently decided to foster a dog, citing the   stay-at-home measures as the perfect opportunity to give the pet a home.  ""We had always wanted a dog,"" Cappos said. ""But, we knew we wouldn't have the time to give it the attention that it deserves.""  [caption id=""attachment_379860"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""768""]    (Courtesy of Lacey Cappos)[/caption]  However, because of these new circumstances, Cappos said she now has another friend to play and get out of the house with, while her dog Ciaro gets a happy home and plenty of attention.  Whether it's a dog like Ciaro or a bird like Kiwi, animal   companions do so much to bring joy to their owners and some great health benefits to boot.  So, the next time you're feeling low, go give your pooch a smooch      for both his happiness and yours  and remember to appreciate the animals that help make staying at home a little less lonely.",['cap-alexandra-bell'],"['lifestyle-quad', 'student-life', 'quad']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/05/Emily-Dembinski.png

But after starting Pac-12 action with a 5-0 record, No. 8 UCLA women's basketball (25-4, 14-4 Pac-12) lost four of its last 13 games against conference opponents, including a loss to unranked Washington, which is 122nd in the country in RPI.  Close said enjoyment of the game and quality of play have been linked throughout the season and especially in the latter parts of conference play.  &#8220;We wanted to have more fun playing this game,&#8221; Close said. &#8220;We haven't been having as much fun (recently) because we know deep down that we haven't been playing as well as we need to.&#8221;  UCLA turned the ball over 17 and 11 times in its respective victories this past weekend against Colorado and Utah, and gave away 11 possessions in its loss to Washington on Feb. 23.   The spike in the Bruins' turnovers was a part of Close's broader analysis of UCLA's recent struggles against conference opponents of all records, as she said the team's last week of practice and film-study centered around reducing unforced mistakes.   &#8220;We counted every mental error (from the Washington loss),&#8221; Close said. &#8220;It really hurt our hearts, but it also gave us hope because those are things we can really control.&#8221;   One of the changes Close made over the weekend was allotting more playing time to freshman guard Camryn Brown, who combined for 42 minutes in the past two contests after averaging 6.1 minutes per game through her first 14 games of conference play.  Brown also hit seven shots on the weekend after making just nine shots over her first 20 games of action, as her team outscored its opponents by 14 when she was on the court.  The freshman from Lewisville, Texas, said her composure in the pair of contests stemmed from the belief showed by her fellow players and coaches after she had committed more fouls than points scored leading up to the weekend.   ""It was super comfortable because I knew that my teammates trust me and my coaches, and I was just going out there to just play,"" Brown said.    One of those teammates is redshirt senior guard Japreece Dean, who leads the squad in minutes played during conference games and is the third-leading scorer for the Bruins in Pac-12 play.   In Dean's final season at UCLA, the Bruins have clinched the No. 2 seed for the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas, after entering the tournament as the No. 4 seed a year ago.  Dean has only turned the ball over five times once in conference games this season, and she said she is personally not concerned with UCLA&#8217;s seeding when it takes on conference rivals at the Mandalay Bay Events Center.  &#8220;Honestly, I don't think (the Pac-12 tournament seeding) means much to me,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;I know it's better for us in the Pac-12 and who we play, but I'm really not too focused on where we are.&#8221;  Close will coach in her ninth conference tournament this week, and she shared the team&#8217;s mindset while heading into final weekend of the regular season.  &#8220;We're not going to worry about anybody else,&#8221; Close said.

The Bruins held a 3-1 lead over the Waves after freshman Abbey Forbes and redshirt senior Jada Hart secured singles wins on courts two and three. With the team needing one more singles win to earn the team victory, juniors Abi Altick and Annette Goulak were in the midst of second set tiebreakers after each winning their first sets.  The clinching win came on court four, as the home crowd erupted in cheers when Altick rallied to win her tiebreaker, which clinched the eventual 4-3 victory for No. 8 UCLA women&#8217;s tennis (10-1) over No. 17 Pepperdine (6-4) on Saturday.  &#8220;It was a really good feeling,&#8221; Altick said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t happen all the time, so I think I did a good job of embracing my teammates on the side and using their energy to get me through.&#8221;  Altick took a 5-3 lead in her second set against Pepperdine&#8217;s Lisa Zaar after picking up her first set 6-1 &#8211; one set away from giving UCLA its second singles point. Zaar came back to force a tiebreaker in this set, however, and Altick would have to play the extra points that ultimately decided the match. Altick and Goulak had also clinched the doubles point for UCLA with a 6-3 victory over Pepperdine&#8217;s Zaar and Daria Kuczer.  &#8220;(Altick)&#8217;s played some very long points, it&#8217;s very mental for her,&#8221; said coach Stella Sampras Webster. &#8220;(Zaar) came back and played really good tennis, so (Altick) really had to stay strong mentally to stay in it, and she did. She didn&#8217;t break down, she really fought hard and it was great to see her succeed and get the clinch. It&#8217;s all about momentum, and I think the home crowd gave her some extra energy.&#8221;  Forbes &#8211; who earned the Bruins&#8217; first singles point with a 6-4, 6-1 victory over the Waves&#8217; Jessica Failla &#8211; also said the home crowd played a big factor in her success.  &#8220;Playing at home is always an advantage,&#8221; Forbes said. &#8220;I have the Bruin nation behind me, which makes me feel a lot better. In those tough situations, the crowd makes it so much easier to get through it and have confidence in myself.&#8221;  With the win, the Bruins improved to 56-18 all-time over the Waves. The win also secured a two-match weekend sweep of the Bruins' Southern California rivals, after UCLA defeated USC 5-2 on Friday at Marks Stadium  &#8220;Both matches were awesome,&#8221; Forbes said. &#8220;It was a great first experience for me and (freshman Sasha Vagramov). It&#8217;s a great start, I think that it&#8217;s going to be a long season and we&#8217;ll get a lot more matches like this that will push us and make us stronger as a team.&#8221;  Sampras Webster said the team will look to build off the momentum it built in the last couple of matches, especially as it begins conference play next weekend.   &#8220;This was a great weekend,&#8221; Sampras Webster said. &#8220;I think everyone should be feeling pretty confident going into next weekend, but it&#8217;s not going to get easier. Every match is going to be tough, and we have to be mentally and physically ready to go.&#8221;  UCLA will travel to Northern California to take on California and No. 6 Stanford on Friday and Saturday, respectively.

Goldberg, who has clinched both of the Bruins 4-3 wins this season and has clinched four total victories, defeated the Ducks&#8217; Riki Oshima, 5-7, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (1) after coming back from a 5-1 deficit in the second set and fending off eight match points.  &#8220;It was just an incredible comeback, facing 0-40 when being down 1-5, it was awesome,&#8221;  said coach Billy Martin. &#8220;It&#8217;s always tough when everything is solely focused on you, and he rose to the occasion.&#8221;  Goldberg said that the support of his best friend, who plays for the  Ducks' men's basketball program, and UCLA's volunteer assistant coach Wil Martin pushed him over the top.  &#8220;I had the steepest hill to climb, but I never gave up,&#8221; Goldberg said. &#8220;They were right in my ear all match, watching me step by step, and it just helped me believe. I&#8217;ll never give up and I just kept on fighting.&#8221;  After sealing the match and silencing the Oregon crowd on an Oshima unforced error, Goldberg stared straight at his teammates and danced with his arms high in the air before being pummeled by the rest of the Bruins.  &#8220;Anytime (Oshima) won a point, their crowd was loud and cruel and that hurt,"" Goldberg said. ""So silencing them by winning made everything even better and then having my teammates going nuts every point, that&#8217;s what playing sports is all about. It doesn&#8217;t get any cooler than this.&#8221;  However, Goldberg&#8217;s tiebreak in the deciding set was far from the only other critical tiebreak in the match, as sophomores Patrick Zahraj and Mathew Tsolakyan both won their singles matches in tiebreaks as well, giving the Bruins a temporary 3-1 lead.  Tsolakyan &#8211; who has won all five of his singles matches since being penciled into the dual match lineup &#8211; beat Oregon&#8217;s Brandon Lam 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (4), to continue his undefeated run. Zahraj won a second-set tiebreak against Washington, and he beat Oregon's Luke Vandecasteele on Sunday 7-5, 7-6 (3).  Martin said that, while both players had periods of weakness, their wins set the tone for the rollercoaster match.  &#8220;(Zahraj's) win was probably the win was probably the win that got our team to believe that we could come back into the match after losing the doubles,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;(Tsolakyan) didn&#8217;t play a good second set, but him playing a good tiebreak was huge for us.&#8221;  The Bruins had to fight back from a 1-0 deficit after losing the doubles point when the No. 24 ranked tandem of junior Keegan Smith and sophomore Govind Nanda suffered their first loss to a ranked opponent this season. They lost to the No. 11 doubles team of Joshua Charlton and Ty Gentry, 6-4.  Smith, ranked No. 8 nationally, quickly evened the score at 1-1 with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Charlton in singles, pushing his record against ranked opponents to 8-4.   The Bruins will return to Southern California to compete in the Pacific Coast Doubles Championship in San Diego next weekend.

No. 12 UCLA men&#8217;s volleyball (8-8, 2-3 MPSF) will play No. 3 UCSB (12-2, 0-0 Big West) for the second time this season Tuesday at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome in Santa Barbara.   The Gauchos swept the Bruins earlier this season Feb. 19. UCLA was outhit .267 to .169 as a team, with freshman outside hitter/opposite Cole Ketrzynski and freshman outside hitter Alex Knight hitting for season-lows of -.059 and -.273, respectively.   However, this time around, the Bruins might feature two different setters in their lineup, as has been a recent trend. UCLA has played redshirt junior setter/outside hitter Sam Kobrine and freshman setter/opposite Mads Kyed Jensen on the court at the same time in its previous two matches. The two have combined for a total of 80 assists in that span.   Kyed Jensen said having another setter on the court allows for better transition play.  &#8220;We haven&#8217;t really (had two setters) that much,&#8221; Kyed Jensen said. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting used to it still, but I think it&#8217;s real nice. It gives us a lot of opportunities offensively, in transition especially.&#8221;  Kobrine had zero kills this season before accumulating 12 in the past two games while hitting for .344.   Kyed Jensen also set his season high in kills, with 14 in his most recent match against No. 4 Long Beach State.   The Bruins are coming off a five-set loss to the Beach on Saturday, a match in which UCLA allowed its opponent to hit for .417 while only hitting for .250. Coach John Speraw said despite the loss, he likes the way the Bruins are trending.  &#8220;I&#8217;m happy with our fight,&#8221; Speraw said. &#8220;That&#8217;s just the direction we want to keep going.&#8221;  UCSB has won its last six matches, five of which came against ranked opponents. The Gauchos have only dropped three sets in that span and have swept their last four opponents. In its last match against USC, UCSB hit for .456 as a team and tallied seven blocks in three sets.   The Gauchos also haven't dropped a set or a match at home this season, going 6-0, but have only played one ranked opponent.   The Bruins are 4-8 this season against currently ranked opponents, but senior middle blocker Daenan Gyimah said he is not worried about the state of the team.  &#8220;We&#8217;re getting better, slowly,&#8221; Gyimah said. &#8220;That&#8217;s all that matters. We don&#8217;t have to be good yet.&#8221; ",[],"['mens-volleyball', 'sports']",https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2020/03/web.sp_.mvb_.pre_.AB_.jpg
